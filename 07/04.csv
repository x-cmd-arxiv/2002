over a month after this transition. The source was detected at an unabsorbed
0.5-10 keV flux of only (2.7 - 3.6) x 10^{-13} ergs/s/cm/cm, which implies a
0.5-10 keV X-ray luminosity of approximately (3.2 - 4.3) x 10^{33} (d/10 kpc)^2
erg/s, with d the distance to the source in kpc. Its spectrum had a thermal
shape and could be well fitted by either a blackbody with a temperature kT of
0.3 keV or a neutron star atmosphere model with a kT of ~0.1 keV. The
luminosity and spectral shape of MXB 1659-29 are very similar to those observed
of the other neutron star X-ray transients when they are in their quiescent
state. The source was variable during our observation, exhibiting a complete
eclipse of the inner part of the system by the companion star. Dipping behavior
was observed before the eclipse, likely due to obscuration by an extended
feature in the outer part of a residual accretion disk. We discuss our
observation in the context of the cooling neutron star model proposed to
explain the quiescent properties of neutron star X-ray transients.

is in good agreement with the observational results of Markevitch et al.(1998)

a polytropic equation of state. Our result is also in good agreement with a
recent sample of clusters observed by BeppoSAX though there is some indication
of missing physics at small radii ($r<0.2 r_{vir}$). We discuss the

that, for $r>0.2 r_{vir}$, our universal temperature profile is consistent with
our most recent simulations which include both radiative cooling and supernovae

somewhat less than 10^4 K (the warm neutral medium, or WNM). These two phases

P_min and P_max in the plane of the Galaxy as a function of Galactocentric

ionization rate of atomic hydrogen. Over most of the disk of the Galaxy, the H
I must be in two phases: the weight of the H I in the gravitational potential
of the Galaxy is large enough to generate thermal pressures exceeding P_min, so
that turbulent pressure fluctuations can produce cold gas that is thermally
stable; and the mean density of the H I is too low for the gas to be all CNM.

than previous estimates. We also examine the potential impact of turbulent
heating on our results and provide expressions for the heating rate as a

large departures from LTE are common throughout the envelope even at large

We employ several concepts to improve the stability, and convergence
rate/control including the concept of leading elements, the use of net rates,

equivalent-2-level approach, and predictive corrector methods. For appropriate

presence of dense halos in galaxies and the absence of intergalactic/escaping

winds around 4% of the total mass of the galaxy. This translates to limits on
the baryons participating the early star bursts and baryons locked in stellar

clear relation each other. The scatter along the AMR exists even if the stars
with the same orbits are selected. We examine simple extension of one-zone GCE
models which account for inhomogeneity in the effective yield and inhomogeneous
star formation rate in the Galaxy. Both extensions of one-zone GCE model cannot
account for the scatter in age - [Fe/H] - [Ca/Fe] relation simultaneously. We
conclude, therefore, that the scatter along the thin disc AMR is an essential
feature in the formation and evolution of the Galaxy. The AMR for thick disc
stars shows that the star formation terminated 8 Gyr ago in thick disc. As
already reported by Gratton et.al. (2000) and Prochaska et.al. (2000), thick

possible to fit the mass $M(\sigma)$ with entropy index $P\rho^{-\gamma}$ less
than $\sigma$ to a simple power-law form, which is almost invariant as the
cluster cools. We show that radiative cooling automatically establishes this
power-law form if the entropy index was constant throughout the cluster gas at
some early epoch or after an AGN activity cycle. To high precision, the central
value of $\sigma$ decreases linearly in time. The fraction of clusters in a
magnitude-limited sample that have gas cooler than $T$ is calculated, and is
shown to be small for $T=2\keV$. Similarly, only 1 percent of clusters in such
a sample contain gas with $P\rho^{-\gamma} < 2\keV\cm^2$. Entropy production in
shocks is shown to be small. The entropy that is radiated from the cluster can
be replaced if a few percent of the cluster gas passes through bubbles heated
during an outburst of the AGN.

involved, but they do not identify the actual triggering mechanisms for

empirical laws too, including turbulence compression and expanding shell
collapse. The self-similar nature of the gas and associated young stars
suggests that turbulence is more directly involved, but the small scale
morphology of gas around most embedded clusters does not look like a random
turbulent flow. Most clusters look triggered by other nearby stars. Such a
prominent local influence makes it difficult to understand the universality of
the Kennicutt and Schmidt laws on galactic scales. A unified view of
multi-scale star formation avoids most of these problems. Ambient self-gravity
produces spiral arms and drives much of the turbulence that leads to
self-similar structures, while localized energy input from existing clusters
and field supernovae triggers new clusters in pre-existing clouds. The
hierarchical structure in the gas made by turbulence ensures that the
triggering time scales with size, giving the Schmidt law over a wide range of
scales and the size-duration correlation for young star fields. The efficiency
of star formation is determined by the fraction of the gas above a critical
density of around 10^5 m(H2)/cc. Star formation is saturated to its largest
possible value given the fractal nature of the interstellar medium.

the ``pixel optical depth'' (POD) method of QSO spectrum analysis, using
realistic simulated spectra from cosmological simulations. In this method,
absorption in Ly-alpha is compared to corresponding metal absorption on a
pixel-by-pixel basis, yielding for each analyzed spectrum a single statistical
correlation encoding metal enrichment information. Our simulations allow
testing and optimization of each step of the technique's implementation. Tests
show that previous studies have probably been limited by C IV
self-contamination and O VI contamination by HI lines; we have developed and
tested an effective method of correcting for both contaminants. We summarize
these and other findings, and provide a useful recipe for the POD technique's
application to observed spectra. Our tests reveal that the POD technique
applied to spectra of presently available quality is effective in recovering
useful metallicity information even in underdense gas. We present an extension
of the POD technique to directly recover the intergalactic metallicity as a
function of gas density. For a given ionizing background, both the oxygen and
carbon abundance can be measured with errors of at most a factor of a few over
at least an order of magnitude in density, using a single high-quality

when two arbitrary languages can be connected. These mappings serve to unravel
symmetries which are hidden in one representation but become manifest in

leads to the idea of {\it universality} or equivalence. Moreover, we introduce
the novel concept of {\it emergent symmetry} as another symmetry guiding

determine the quantum phase diagram of lattice models (previously unsolved) and
unveil hidden order parameters to explore new states of matter. Hierarchical
languages also constitute an essential tool to provide a unified description of
phases which compete and coexist. Overall, our framework provides a simple and
systematic methodology to predict and discover new kinds of orders. Another

independent, while the amplitude exhibits a maximum at about 2.2 K and vanishes

dependence of the signal amplitude, the signal amplitude temperature dependence
is calculated assuming a model based on heating. The model ascribes the
resonant absorption of microwave power of the 2DES to the uniform mode of the
electron spin magnetization where the elementary spin excitations at filling
factor are taken to be spin waves, while the short wavelength spin wave modes
serve as a heat sink for the absorbed energy. Due to the finite thermal
conductance to the surroundings, the temperature of the 2DES spin wave system
is increased, resulting in a thermal activation of the longitudinal
magnetoconductance. The proposed heating model correctly predicts the location
of the maximum in the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the
EDESR amplitude. It also correctly predicts that the signal should vanish as

character of the solvation behavior of apolar solutes at small and large length

collective effect, which means that implicit solvent models should be used with
care. We then discuss a recently developed explicit solvent model, in which the
solvent is not described at the atomic level, but rather at the level of a
density field. The model is based upon a lattice-gas model, which describes
density fluctuations in the solvent at large length scales, and a Gaussian
model, which describes density fluctuations at smaller length scales. By
integrating out the small length scale field, a Hamiltonian is obtained, which
is a function of the binary, large-length scale field only. This makes it
possible to simulate much larger systems than hitherto possible as demonstrated
by the application of the model to the collapse of an ideal hydrophobic
polymer. The results show that the collapse is dominated by the dynamics of the
solvent, in particular the formation of a vapor bubble of critical size.

therefore predict the cost of the final design solution. The problem is
considered from the information engine point of view. That is, the process of
evolutionary gate-level circuit design is presented via such measures as
entropy, logical work and information vitality. Some examples of geometry
driven synthesis are provided to prove the above idea.

function (RBF) collocation scheme for general PDEs. Like the method of
fundamental solution (MFS), the RBF is employed to approximate the
inhomogeneous terms via the dual reciprocity principle. Unlike the MFS, the
method uses a nonsingular general solution instead of a singular fundamental
solution to evaluate the homogeneous solution so as to circumvent the
controversial artificial boundary outside the physical domain. The BKM is
meshfree, superconvergent, integration free, very easy to learn and program.
The original BKM, however, loses symmetricity in the presense of mixed
boundary. In this study, by analogy with Hermite RBF interpolation, we
developed a symmetric BKM scheme. The accuracy and efficiency of the symmetric
BKM are also numerically validated in some 2D and 3D Helmholtz and diffusion
reaction problems under complicated geometries.

the RBF on numerical integration analysis based on an intrinsic relationship
between the Green's boundary integral representation and RBF. It is found that
the kernel function of integral equation is important to create efficient RBF.
The fundamental solution RBF (FS-RBF) was presented as a novel strategy
constructing operator-dependent RBF. We proposed a conjecture formula featuring
the dimension affect on error bound to show the independent-dimension merit of
the RBF techniques. We also discussed wavelet RBF, localized RBF schemes, and
the influence of node placement on the RBF solution accuracy. The
centrosymmetric matrix structure of the RBF interpolation matrix under
symmetric node placing is proved.

collocation technique. The BKM was tested to the Helmholtz, Laplace, linear and
nonlinear convection-diffusion problems. In particular, we introduced the
response knot-dependent nonsingular general solution to calculate
varying-parameter and nonlinear steady convection-diffusion problems very
efficiently. By comparing with the multiple dual reciprocity method, we
discussed the completeness issue of the BKM.
  Finally, the nonsingular solutions for some known differential operators were
given in appendix. Also we expanded the RBF concepts by introducing time-space

rather low Q2 achievable at this energy. Two new dedicated DVCS experiments
using 6 GeV beam will run in 2003 and 2004 in Hall A and Hall B respectively.
Both experiments will yield very accurate results over a wide range of
kinematics, and allow for the first time a precise test of the factorization of

experiments will allow the extraction of linear combinations of GPD's and put
strong constraints on the available phenomenological models. Upon successful
completion of both experiments, a wider experimental program at 6 GeV can be
envisioned, using for instance Deuterium targets trying to nail down the
neutron and deuteron GPD's. In addition, resonances can be probed using
DeltaVCS where one produces a resonance in the final state. Finally, the 12 GeV

$'X'$ denotes any inclusive hadronic state and Q represents the invariant mass

partonic subprocesses have been included provided the lepton pair is created by

unpolarized proton-proton scattering the dominant subprocess is given by
$q(\bar q) + g \to \gamma^* + 'X'$ so that massive lepton pair production
provides us with an excellent method to measure the spin density of the gluon.
Our calculations are carried out using the method of n-dimensional
regularization by making a special choice for the $\gamma_5$-matrix. Like in
the case of many other prescriptions evanescent counter terms appear. They are
determined by computing the NLO coefficient functions for $d\Delta\sigma/dQ^2$

regularization and a four dimensional regularization technique in which the
$\gamma_5$-matrix is uniquely defined. Our calculations reveal that the

flat background this model contains mass terms, which lift the flat directions
of the potential and renders its spectrum discrete. The supersymmetry algebra
of the model groups the energy eigenstates into supermultiplets, whose members
differ by fixed amounts of energy in great similarity to the representation of
supersymmetry in AdS spaces. There is a unique and exact zero-energy
groundstate along with a multitude of long and short multiplets of excited
states. For large masses the quantum mechanical model may be treated
perturbatively and we study the leading order energy shifts of the first
excited states up to level two. Most interestingly we uncover a protected short
multiplet at level two, whose energies do not receive perturbative corrections.
Moreover, we conjecture the existence of an infinite series of similar
protected multiplets in the pp-wave matrix model.

of heavy ions at the SPS and at RHIC are compared to a hydrodynamic
parameterization. While the chemical temperature needed at RHIC is
significantly higher compared to SPS, the spectra may be described using
kinetic freeze-out parameters which are similar for both beam energies. At RHIC
either the temperature or the flow velocity is higher, but the data provide no
unambiguous proof for much stronger transverse flow. The contribution of such
hydrodynamic emission at high transverse momenta is investigated in detail. It
is shown that hydrodynamics may be relevant up to relatively high transverse
momenta. The importance of the velocity profile used in this context is
highlighted.

curtail the lifespan of the clone donor. Neither the arrangement of this
suggested empirical study nor the analyses of the anticipated outcomes rely on
the accompanying theoretical contemplations. This prediction has come from the
interpretation of the genome as a ""barcode"". The genome is considered as an
identification label rather than a repository of control information, so living
beings are portrayed as a community of users on the ""Internet of the physical
Universe"". Thus, biological objects with identical (or nearly identical) DNA
structures can interfere, and the surmised remote impact appears tangible. The
effect of clone-donor interaction leads to a decisive Experimentum Crucis that
can reject the common view on the organization of biological information
processing. Exploitation of this effect can be potentially dangerous.

dispersing and absorbing macroscopic bodies is derived, with the relevant
couplings being expressed in terms of the surroundings-assisted Green tensor.
It is shown that under certain conditions the RDDI can be regarded as being
governed by an effective Hamiltonian. The theory, which applies to both weak
and strong atom-field coupling, is used to study the resonant energy exchange
between two (two-level) atoms sharing initially a single excitation. In
particular, it is shown that in the regime of weak atom-field coupling there is
a time window, where the energy transfer follows a transfer-rate law of the
type obtained by ordinary second-order perturbation theory. Finally, the
spectrum of the light emitted during the energy transfer is studied and the
line splittings are discussed.

$\tilde{\tau}_{0}$ denote the closest separable state to $\rho_{0}$ along the
line segment from $I/N$ to $\rho_{0}$ where $I$ is the identity matrix.
Following [pitrubmat] a witness $W_{0}$ detecting the entanglement of
$\rho_{0}$ can be constructed in terms of $I, \tau_{0}$ and $\tilde{\tau}_{0}$.
If representations of $\tau_{0}$ and $\tilde{\tau}_{0}$ as convex combinations
of separable projections are known, then the entanglement of $\rho_{0}$ can be
detected by local measurements. G\""{u}hne \textit{et. al.} in [bruss1] obtain
the minimum number of measurement settings required for a class of two qubit
states. We use our geometric approach to generalize their result to the
corresponding two qudit case when $d$ is prime and obtain the minimum number of
measurement settings. In those particular bipartite cases,
$\tau_{0}=\tilde{\tau}_{0}$. We illustrate our general approach with a two
parameter family of three qubit bound entangled states for which $\tau_{0} \neq
\tilde{\tau}_{0}$ and we show our approach works for $n$ qubits.
  In [pitt] we elaborated on the role of a ``far face'' of the separable states
relative to a bound entangled state $\rho_{0}$ constructed from an orthogonal
unextendible product base. In this paper the geometric approach leads to an
entanglement witness expressible in terms of a constant times $I$ and a
separable density $\mu_{0}$ on the far face from $\rho_{0}$. Up to a
normalization this coincides with the witness obtained in [bruss1] for the
particular example analyzed there.

and quantum information. Classical information is locally accessible and allows
one to perform tasks such as physical work, while quantum information allows
one to perform tasks such as teleportation. It is shown that these two kinds of
information are complementarity in the sense that two parties can either gain
access to the quantum information, or to the classical information but not
both. This complementarity has a form very similar to the complementarities
usually encountered in quantum mechanics. For pure states, the entanglement
plays the role of Planck's constant. We also find another class of
complementarity relations which applies to operators, and is induced when two
parties can only perform local operations and communicate classical. In order
to formalize this notion we define the restricted commutator. Observables such
as the parity and phase of two qubits commute, but their restricted commutator
is non-zero. It is also found that complementarity is pure in the sense that
can be ''decoupled'' from the uncertainty principle.
