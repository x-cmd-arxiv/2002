first detection of the Cosmic far-Infrared Background (CIB) fluctuations at 60
and 100 microns. The power spectrum of 12 low cirrus emission regions is
characterized by a power excess at spatial frequencies higher than k~0.02
arcmin^{-1}. Most of this excess is due to noise and to nearby point sources
with a flux stronger than 1 Jy. But we show that when these contributions are
carefully removed, there is still a power excess that is the signature of the
CIB fluctuations. The power spectrum of the CIB at 60 and 100 microns is
compatible with a Poissonian distribution, at spatial frequencies between 0.025
and 0.2 arcmin^{-1}. The fluctuation level is ~1.6x10^3 Jy^2/sr and ~5.8x10^3
Jy^2/sr at 60 and 100 microns respectively. The levels of the fluctuations are
used in a larger framework, with other observationnal data, to constrain the
evolution of IR galaxies (Lagache et al. 2002). The detections reported here,
coupled with the level of the fluctuations at 170 microns, give strong
constraints on the evolution of the IR luminosity function. The combined
results at 60, 100 and 170 microns for the CIB and its fluctuations allows, on
the CIB at 60 microns, to put a firm upper limit of 0.27 MJy/sr and to give an
estimate of 0.18 MJy/sr.

investigate whether the blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy I Zw 18 possesses an
extended low-surface-brightness (LSB) old stellar population underlying its
star-forming (SF) regions. We show that the exponential intensity decrease
observed in the filamentary LSB envelope of the BCD out to 18 arcsec (1.3 kpc
at a distance of 15 Mpc) is not due to an evolved stellar disc, but rather due
to extended ionized gas emission. Broad-band images reveal, after subtraction
of nebular line emission, a compact stellar LSB component extending slightly
beyond the SF regions. This stellar host, being blue over a radius range of 5
exponential scale lengths and showing little colour contrast to the SF
component, differs strikingly from the red LSB host of standard BCDs. This
fact, in connection with the blue colors of component I Zw 18 C, suggests that
most of the stellar mass in I Zw 18 has formed within the last 0.5 Gyr.
Furthermore, we show that the exponential intensity fall-off in the filamentary
ionized envelope of I Zw 18 is not particular to this system but a common
property of the ionized halo of many SF dwarf galaxies on galactocentric
distances of several kpc. In the absence of an appreciable underlying stellar
background, extended ionized gas emission dominates in the periphery of I Zw
18, mimicking an exponential stellar disc on optical surface brightness
profiles.

cluster at z=0.143. We construct gas and temperature profiles up to ~1700 kpc,
equivalent to ~0.7 r_200. The gas distribution is well described by a beta
model in the outer regions, but is more concentrated in the inner ~250 kpc. We
introduce a new parameterisation for the inner regions, allowing a steeper gas
density distribution. The projected radial temperature profile declines
gradually towards the outer regions, by ~20% between 0.1 r_200 and 0.5 r_200,
and is well described by a polytropic model with gamma = 1.07+/-0.01. We find
that neither projection nor PSF effects change substantially the form of the
temperature profile. Assuming hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and spherical
symmetry, we use the observed temperature profile and the new parametric form
for the gas density profile to produce the total mass distribution. The mass
profile is remarkably well fitted with the Moore et al. (1999) parameterisation
with a concentration parameter in the range expected from numerical
simulations. There are several indications that beyond a density contrast delta
\~600, the gas may no longer be in HE. There is an offset with respect to
adiabatic numerical simulations in the virialised part of the cluster, in that
the predicted mass for the cluster temperature is ~40% too high. The gas
distribution is peaked in the centre primarily as a result of the cusp in the
dark matter profile. The X-ray gas to total mass ratio rises with increasing
radius to f_gas ~ 0.2. These data strongly support the validity of the current
approach for the modelling of the dark matter collapse, but confirm that
understanding the gas specific physics is essential. (Abridged)

to a few solar masses per second. Popham et al. and Narayan et al. have shown
that, for Mdot >~ 0.1 Msun/s, accretion proceeds via neutrino cooling and
neutrinos can carry away a significant amount of energy from the inner regions
of the disks. We improve on these calculations by including a simple
prescription for neutrino transfer and neutrino opacities in such regions. We
find that the flows become optically thick to neutrinos inside a radius
R~6-40R_s for Mdot in the range of 0.1 -10 Msun/s, where R_s is the black hole
Schwarzchild radius. Most of the neutrino emission comes from outside this
region and, the neutrino luminosity stays roughly constant at a value L_{\nu} ~
10^{53} erg/s. We show that, for Mdot > 1 Msun/s, neutrinos are sufficiently
trapped that energy advection becomes the dominant cooling mechanism in the
flow. These results imply that neutrino annihilation in hyperaccreting black
holes is an inefficient mechanism for liberating large amounts of energy.
Extraction of rotational energy by magnetic processes remains the most viable
mechanism.

faintest afterglows detected to date, and it exhibits a relatively rapid decay,
$F_\nu\propto t^{-1.60\pm 0.04}$, followed by further steepening. In addition,
a weak radio source was found coincident with the optical afterglow. The HST
observations reveal that a positionally coincident host galaxy must be the
faintest host to date, R>29.5 mag. The afterglow observations can be explained
by several models requiring little or no extinction within the host galaxy,
A_V~0-0.9 mag. These observations have significant implications for the
statistics of the so-called dark bursts (bursts for which no optical afterglow
is detected), which are usually attributed to dust extinction within the host
galaxy. The faintness and relatively rapid decay of the afterglow of GRB
020124, combined with the low inferred extinction indicate that some dark
bursts are intrinsically dim and not dust obscured. Thus, the diversity in the
underlying properties of optical afterglows must be observationally determined
before substantive inferences can be drawn from the statistics of dark bursts.

how the cyclotron line energy relates to the continuum and therefore how the
neutron star B-field influences the X-Ray emission. As expected, we found a
correlation between the CRSF energy and the spectral cutoff energy. However,
with our consistent set of fits we found that the relationship is more complex

width of the cyclotron line correlate with the energy (as suggested by theory),

loss propels it toward the minimum stable mass of a (proto)-neutron star,
whereupon it explodes. Imshennik and Popov have shown that the explosion of the
unstable, cold star can result in a large recoil velocity of the remaining
neutron star. Here, we consider several factors that mitigate the effect and
broaden the range of final recoil speeds, in particular the finite velocity and
gravitational deflection of the ejecta, a range of original masses for the low
mass companion and its cooling history, rotational phase averaging of the

minimum Reynolds number exists even without a magnetic field, but there are
also solutions with smaller Reynolds numbers for certain (weak) magnetic

instability, however, can only exist for not too small magnetic Prandtl
numbers. Also the situation for nonaxisymmetric disturbances is considered.
Without magnetic fields such modes possess higher Reynolds numbers than the
axisymmetric modes. The situation is changed in the MHD regime. For modest
magnetic fields the excitation of modes with m=1 is easier than the excitation
of modes with m=0 if critical magnetic amplitudes are exceeded.

magnetic field amplitude beyond which the instability sets in in form of
nonaxisymmetric spirals with the azimuthal number m=1. Obviously, the magnetic
field is able to excite nonaxisymmetric configurations despite of the tendency
of differential rotation to favor axisymmetric magnetic fields which is known
from the dynamo theory. If Pm is too big or too small, however, the
axisymmetric mode with m=0 appears to be the most unstable one possessing the
lowest Reynolds numbers -- as it is also true for hydrodynamic Taylor-Couette

Present supernova observations are analysed using a standard $\chi^2$ method

confirm the difficulty to discriminate between these models using present SNeIa

$\Omega_m$ with a good value of $\chi^2_{min}$ could be found if the right
cosmological model is not used to fit the data. We finally give some
probabilities to obtain unambiguous results, free from degeneracies. In
particular, the probability to confuse a cosmological constant with a true

the radio morphology to the properties of their host galaxies. The orientation

naturally form in this geometrical situation: as a jet propagates in a

laterally at a high rate producing wings of radio emission, in a way that is

map or a weak lensing map is an essential step in extracting science from it,
but when the map covers only part of the sky and/or is pixelized, this
decomposition cannot be done perfectly. We present a method for decomposing an
arbitrary sky map into a sum of three orthogonal components that we term ``pure
E'', ``pure B'' and ``ambiguous''. This method is useful both for providing
intuition for experimental design and for analyzing data sets in practice. We
show how to find orthonormal bases for all three components in terms of
bilaplacian eigenfunctions. The number of ambiguous modes is proportional to
the length of the map boundary so fairly round maps are preferred. For
real-world data analysis, we present a simple matrix eigenvalue method for
calculating nearly pure E and B modes in pixelized maps. We find that the
dominant source of leakage between E and B is aliasing of small-scale power
caused by the pixelization. This problem can be eliminated by heavily
oversampling the map, but is exacerbated by the fact that the E power spectrum
is expected to be much larger than the B power spectrum and extremely blue. We
found that a factor of 2 to 3 more pixels are needed in a polarization map to
achieve the same level of contamination by aliased power than in a temperature
map.

coupling of the concentration (phi) to the shear rate (gamma_dot) and micellar

along the homogeneous intrinsic flow curve. For startup ``quenches'' into the
unstable region, the instability in general occurs before the homogeneous
startup flow can attain the intrinsic flow curve. We predict the selected time
and length scales at which inhomogeneity first emerges. In the ``infinite
drag'' limit, fluctuations in the mechanical variables (gamma_dot and
\tensor{W}) are independent of those in phi, and are unstable when the slope of
the intrinsic flow curve is negative; but no length scale is selected. For
finite drag, the mechanical instability is enhanced by coupling to phi and a
length scale is selected, in qualitative agreement with recent experiments. For
systems far from an underlying zero-shear demixing instability this enhancement
is slight, while close to demixing the instability sets in at low shear rates

simple strategy: at each iteration, they choose a set of ``independent'' points

that such a set of independent points can be constructed efficiently in
parallel and that the number of iterations needed is $O(\log^2(L/s))$, where
$L$ is the diameter of the domain, and $s$ is the smallest edge in the output
mesh. In addition, we show that the insertion of each independent set of points

Shewchuk's in three dimensions. Therefore, our parallel Delaunay refinement
methods provide the same element quality and mesh size guarantees as the
sequential algorithms in both two and three dimensions. For quasi-uniform
meshes, such as those produced by Chew's method, we show that the number of

propositional logic and first-order logic. It says that if a logical formula
$\beta$ logically follows from a formula $\alpha$, then there is a formula
$\gamma$, including only symbols that appear in both $\alpha,\beta$, such that
$\beta$ logically follows from $\gamma$ and $\gamma$ logically follows from
$\alpha$. Such theorems are important and useful for understanding those logics
in which they hold as well as for speeding up reasoning with theories in those
logics. In this paper we present interpolation theorems in this spirit for
three nonmonotonic systems: circumscription, default logic and logic programs
with the stable models semantics (a.k.a. answer set semantics). These results
give us better understanding of those logics, especially in contrast to their
nonmonotonic characteristics. They suggest that some \emph{monotonicity}
principle holds despite the failure of classic monotonicity for these logics.
Also, they sometimes allow us to use methods for the decomposition of reasoning
for these systems, possibly increasing their applicability and tractability.
Finally, they allow us to build structured representations that use those
logics.

leads to the emergence of thermal spectrum that depends crucially on horizons
(as in de Sitter spacetime) or observer dependent horizons (as in Rindler
spacetime). A connection is sought between the horizon and the formation of
classical condensate. We concentrate on de Sitter spacetime and study the
cosmological perturbation of $k=0$ mode with various values of $m/H_0$. We find
that for a minimally coupled free scalar field for $m^2/H_0^2<2$, the one-mode
occupation number grows more than unity soon after the physical wavelength of
the mode crosses the Hubble radius and soon after diverges as $N(t)\sim
O(1)[\lambda_{phys}(t)/{H_0^{-1}}]^{2\sqrt{\nu^2-1/4}}$, where $\nu\equiv (9/4
-m^2/{H_0^2})^{1/2}$. The results substantiates the previous works in this

small $z$ from a single expression using CWKB approximation for various values

condensates in QCD. The condensates are defined as vacuum averages of the
operators which arise due to nonperturbative effects. The important role of
condensates in determination of physical properties of hadrons and of their
low-energy interactions in QCD is underlined. The special value of quark
condensate, connected with the existence of baryon masses is mentioned. Vacuum
condensates induced by external fields are discussed. QCD at low energy is
checked on the basis of the data on hadronic tau-decay. In the theoretical
analysis the terms of perturbation theory (PT) up to alpha^3_s are accounted,
in the operator product expansion (OPE) - those up to dimension 8. The total
probability of the decay tau->hadrons (with zero strangeness) and of the
tau-decay structure functions are best described at alpha_s(m^2_tau) =
0.330+-0.025. It is shown that the Borel sum rules for tau-decay structure
functions along the rays in the q^2-complex plane are in agreement with the
experiment with the accuracy ~2% at the values of the Borel parameter |M^2|>
0.8 GeV^2. The magnitudes of dimensions 6 and 8 condensates were found and the
limitations on gluonic condensates were obtained. The sum rules for the charmed
quark vector currents polarization operator was analysed in 3 loops (i.e., in
order alpha^2_s). The value of charmed quark mass (in MS-bar regularization
scheme) was found to be: m_c(m_c) = 1.275+-0.015 GeV and the value of gluonic
condensate was estimated: <(alpha_s/pi)G^2> = 0.009+-0.007 GeV^4. The general
conclusion is: QCD described by PT + OPE is in a good agreement with experiment
at Q^2 >~ 1 GeV^2.

local realization (up to Euclidian motions) for the given edge lengths,
although globally they may have several. We study the number of distinct planar
embeddings of minimally rigid graphs with $n$ vertices. We show that, modulo
planar rigid motions, this number is at most ${{2n-4}\choose {n-2}} \approx
4^n$. We also exhibit several families which realize lower bounds of the order
of $2^n$, $2.21^n$ and $2.88^n$.
  For the upper bound we use techniques from complex algebraic geometry, based
on the (projective) Cayley-Menger variety $CM^{2,n}(C)\subset P_{{{n}\choose
{2}}-1}(C)$ over the complex numbers $C$. In this context, point configurations
are represented by coordinates given by squared distances between all pairs of
points. Sectioning the variety with $2n-4$ hyperplanes yields at most
$deg(CM^{2,n})$ zero-dimensional components, and one finds this degree to be
$D^{2,n}={1/2}{{2n-4}\choose {n-2}}$. The lower bounds are related to inductive
constructions of minimally rigid graphs via Henneberg sequences.
  The same approach works in higher dimensions. In particular we show that it
leads to an upper bound of $2 D^{3,n}=
{\frac{2^{n-3}}{n-2}}{{n-6}\choose{n-3}}$ for the number of spatial embeddings

there are no rotational invariant circles (R.I.C's). These orbits have a
non-zero ''vertical rotation number'' (V.R.N.), in contrast to what happens to
Birkhoff periodic orbits and Aubry-Mather sets. The V.R.N. is rational for a
periodic orbit and irrational for a quasi-periodic. We also prove that the
existence of an orbit with a $V.R.N=a>0,$ implies the existence of orbits with
$V.R.N=b,$ for all $0<b<a.$ In this way, related to a generalized definition of
rotation number, we characterize all kinds of periodic and quasi-periodic

complementary observables is proposed. The measured observables are represented
as positive operator valued measures (POVMs), whose intrinsic fuzziness
parameters are found to satisfy an intriguing pay-off relation reflecting the
complementarity. At the same time, this relation represents an instance of a
Heisenberg uncertainty relation for measurement imprecisions. A
model-independent consideration show that this uncertainty relation is
logically connected with the joint measurability of the POVMs in question.

particular of the uncertainty zone developing at the potential curvature sign
inversion, for a damped harmonic oscillator with arbitrary time dependence of
frequency and for arbitrary temperature, within the Caldeira-Leggett model. The
method has been applied to the calculation of the gray zone width Delta Ix of
Josephson-junction balanced comparators driven by a specially designed
low-impedance RSFQ circuit. The calculated temperature dependence of Delta Ix
in the range 1.5 to 4.2K is in a virtually perfect agreement with experimental
data for Nb-trilayer comparators with critical current densities of 1.0 and 5.5
kA/cm^2, without any fitting parameters.

a different number of rounds played are superposed.

that, depending on the phases and the decay characteristic, the system can
exhibit a variety of behaviors, including population inversion and complete
depletion of an atomic state. We explain the phenomena in terms of multi-photon
interference. We compare our results with the phase-dependent phenomena in the
double-$\Lambda$ scheme, as studied in [Korsunsky and Kosachiov, Phys. Rev A
