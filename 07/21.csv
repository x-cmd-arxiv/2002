of four frequencies ranging from 9.15 c/d to 15.90 c/d, while there is a

that thermal emission from isothermal gas does not provide a good fit to the
spectral distribution of the emission from the inner 1 degree radial region.
While the observed spectrum may be fit by emission from gas with a substantial
temperature gradient, it is more likely that the emission includes also a
secondary non-thermal component. If so, non-thermal emission comprises ~8% of
the total 4--20 keV flux. Interpreting this emission as due to Compton
scattering of relativistic electrons (which produce the known extended radio

that there is significant circumnuclear UV/optical emission exciting the

tentatively reported in our previous work. Indeed, excluding the first year's

any lag between the X-ray and optical bands. We also find no correlation at any

the close relation observed between the bands during the first year of our

speculate that there are at least two components or mechanisms contributing to
the X-ray continuum emission up to 10 keV: a soft component that is correlated
with UV/optical variations on timescales >1 day, and whose presence can be
detected when the source is observed at low enough energies (about 1 keV), is
unabsorbed, or is in a sufficiently bright phase; and a hard component whose

recover the observed momentum and energy input rates for PNe and pPNe. High
accretion rates ($M_a \approx 10^{-4}$ \mdot) may be required in the latter

recovered with disk wind models using existing disk formation scenarios. When
combined with existing scenarios for accretion disk formation from disrupted
stellar companions, our models may provide an explanation for the existence of
high speed polar knots (FLIERS) observed in some PNe.

nested abnormality theories (NATs) as a tool for modular knowledge
representation, tailored for applying circumscription to minimize exceptional
circumstances. Abstracting from this particular objective, we propose L_{CIRC},
which is an extension of generic propositional circumscription by allowing
propositional combinations and nesting of circumscriptive theories. As shown,
NATs are naturally embedded into this language, and are in fact of equal
expressive capability. We then analyze the complexity of L_{CIRC} and NATs, and
in particular the effect of nesting. The latter is found to be a source of
complexity, which climbs the Polynomial Hierarchy as the nesting depth
increases and reaches PSPACE-completeness in the general case. We also identify
meaningful syntactic fragments of NATs which have lower complexity. In
particular, we show that the generalization of Horn circumscription in the NAT
framework remains CONP-complete, and that Horn NATs without fixed letters can
be efficiently transformed into an equivalent Horn CNF, which implies
polynomial solvability of principal reasoning tasks. Finally, we also study
extensions of NATs and briefly address the complexity in the first-order case.
Our results give insight into the ``cost'' of using L_{CIRC} (resp. NATs) as a
host language for expressing other formalisms such as action theories,

"math/0207183","Andrei Sobolevskii","Grigori L. Litvinov","Error autocorrection in rational approximation and interval estimates","33 pages; some typos corrected; this version is submitted to the
  Central European Journal of Mathematics",,,,"math.NA math.CA",,"  The error autocorrection effect means that in a calculation all the
intermediate errors compensate each other, so the final result is much more
accurate than the intermediate results. In this case standard interval
estimates are too pessimistic. We shall discuss a very strong form of the
effect which appears in rational approximations to functions, where very
significant errors in the approximant coefficients do not affect the accuracy
of this approximant. The reason is that the errors in the coefficients of the
rational approximant are not distributed in an arbitrary way, but form a
collection of coefficients for a new rational approximant to the same
approximated function. Understanding this mechanism allows to decrease the
approximation error by varying the approximation procedure depending on the
form of the approximant. The effect of error autocorrection indicates that
variations of an approximated function under some deformations of rather
general type may have little effect on the corresponding rational approximant
viewed as a function (whereas the coefficients of the approximant can have very
significant changes). Accordingly, deforming a function for which good rational
approximation is possible may lead to a rapid increase in the corresponding
approximant's error. Thus the property of having a good rational approximation
is not stable under small deformations of the approximated functions: this
property is ""individual"", in the sense that it holds for specific functions.
Results of computer experiments are presented.

that cover the entire spectrum of the distortion profile, ranging from
symmetric or balanced to successively refinable. We present a solution to a
labeling problem, which is an important part of the construction, along with a
general design procedure. This procedure is illustrated using the Z^2 lattice.
The asymptotic performance of the quantizer is analyzed in the high-rate case.
We also evaluate its rate-distortion performance and compare it to known
information theoretic bounds.

introducing fractional order pseudo-differential operators. In the case of the
extension with the half-order pseudo-differential operators, a system analogous
to the supersymmetric extensions of the KP hierarchy is obtained. Unlike the
supersymmetric extensions, no Grassmannian variable appears in the hierarchy
considered here. More general hierarchies constructed by the 1/N-th order
pseudo-differential operators, their integrability and the reduction procedure
are also investigated. In addition to finding out the new extensions of the KP
hierarchy, brief introduction to the Riemann-Liouville integral is provided to
yield a candidate for the fractional order pseudo-differential operators.
