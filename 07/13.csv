calibration of the resulting images remains a major challenge. The AO
point-spread function (PSF) changes quickly both in time and position on the
sky. In a typical observation the star used for guiding will be separated from
the scientific target by 10"" to 30"". This is sufficient separation to render
images of the guide star by themselves nearly useless in characterizing the PSF
at the off-axis target position. A semi-empirical technique is described that
improves the determination of the AO off-axis PSF. The method uses calibration
images of dense star fields to determine the change in PSF with field position.
It then uses this information to correct contemporaneous images of the guide
star to produce a PSF that is more accurate for both the target position and
the time of a scientific observation. We report on tests of the method using
natural-guide-star AO systems on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and Lick
Observatory Shane Telescope, augmented by simple atmospheric computer
simulations. At 25"" off-axis, predicting the PSF full width at half maximum
using only information about the guide star results in an error of 60%. Using
an image of a dense star field lowers this error to 33%, and our method, which
also folds in information about the on-axis PSF, further decreases the error to
19%.

center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical build-up far up in the dark
halo `merger tree'. We assume that the first `seed' black holes (BHs) formed in
(mini)halos collapsing at z=20 from high-sigma density fluctuations. As these
pregalactic holes become incorporated through a series of mergers into larger
and larger halos, they sink to the center owing to dynamical friction, accrete
a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive, form a
binary system, and eventually coalesce. The merger history of dark matter halos
and associated BHs is followed by cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the
merger hierarchy. A simple model, where quasar activity is driven by major
mergers and SMBHs accrete at the Eddington rate a mass that scales with the
fifth power of the velocity dispersion, is shown to reproduce the optical LF of
quasars in the redshift range 1<z<4. Binary and triple BH interactions are
followed in our merger tree. The assumptions underlying our scenario lead to
the prediction of a population of massive BHs wandering in galaxy halos and the
intergalactic medium at the present epoch, and contributing <10% to the total
BH mass density. At all epochs the fraction of binary SMBHs in galaxy nuclei is
of order 10%, while the fraction of binary quasars is less than 0.3%

ESA-ISAS initiative for the study of the evolution of the hot Universe in the
post-Chandra/XMM-Newton era. The key science objectives of XEUS are: Search for
the origin, and subsequent study of growth, of the first massive black holes in
the early Universe; assessment of the formation of the first gravitationally
bound dark matter dominated systems and their evolution; study of the evolution
of metal synthesis up till the present epoch; characterization of the true
intergalactic medium.
  To reach these ambitious science goals the two salient characteristics of the
XEUS observatory entail: (1) Its effective spectroscopic grasp, combining a
sensitive area > 20 m^2 below 2 keV with a spectral resolution better than 2
eV. This allows significant detection of the most prominent X-ray emission
lines (e.g. O-VII, Si-XIII and Fe-XXV) in cosmologically distant sources
against the sky background; (2) Its angular resolving power, between 2 and 5
arc seconds, to minimize source confusion as well as noise due to the galactic
X-ray foreground emission.
  To accommodate these instrument requirements a mission concept has been
developed featuring an X-ray telescope of 50-m focal length, comprising two
laser-locked (separate) mirror and detector spacecraft's. The telescope is
injected in a low earth orbit with an inclination commensurate with the ISS. At
present an on-orbit growth of the mirror spacecraft is foreseen with the aid of
the ISS, raising the mirror diameter from 4.5 to 10 m. The detector spacecraft
will be replaced at 5 year intervals after run-out of consumables with an
associated upgrade of the focal plane package.

surveys of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. In particular, I compare recent
results on the power spectrum and two-point correlation correlation function
from the 2dF and REFLEX surveys, highlighting the advantage of X-ray clusters
in the comparison to cosmological models, given their easy-to-understand mass
selection function. Unlike for galaxies, this allows the overall normalization
of the power spectrum to be measured directly from the data, providing an extra
constraint on the models. In the context of CDM models, both the shape and
amplitude of the REFLEX P(k) require, consistently, a low value for the mean
matter density $\Omega_M$. This shape is virtually indistinguishable from that
of the galaxy power spectrum measured by the 2dF survey, simply multiplied by a
constant cluster-galaxy bias factor. This consistency is remarkable for data
sets which use different tracers and are very different in terms of selection
function and observational biases. Similarly, the knowledge of the power
spectrum normalization yields naturally a value $b\simeq 1$ for the bias
parameter of $b_J$-selected (as in 2dF) galaxies, also in agreement with
independent estimates using higher-order clustering and CMB data. In the final
part, I briefly describe the measurements of the matter density parameter from
redshift space distortions in galaxy surveys, and show evidence for similar
streaming motions of clusters in the REFLEX redshift-space correlation function
$\xi(r_p,\pi)$. With no exception, this wealth of independent clustering
measurements point in a remarkably consistent way towards a low-density CDM
Universe with $\Omega_M\simeq 0.3$.

of the low-luminosity Class 0 protostar IRAM 04191+1522 in the Taurus molecular
cloud. New line observations demonstrate that the ~14000 AU radius protostellar
envelope is undergoing both extended infall and fast, differential rotation.
Radiative transfer modeling of multitransition CS and C34S maps indicate an
infall velocity v_inf ~ 0.15 km/s at r ~ 1500 AU and v_inf ~ 0.1 km/s up to r ~
11000 AU, as well as a rotational angular velocity Omega ~ 3.9 x 10^{-13}
rad/s, strongly decreasing with radius beyond 3500 AU down to a value Omega ~
1.5-3 x 10^{-14} rad/s at ~ 11000 AU. Two distinct regions, which differ in
both their infall and their rotation properties, therefore seem to stand out:
the inner part of the envelope (r ~< 2000-4000 AU) is rapidly collapsing and
rotating, while the outer part undergoes only moderate infall/contraction and
slower rotation. These contrasted features suggest that angular momentum is
conserved in the collapsing inner region but efficiently dissipated due to
magnetic braking in the slowly contracting outer region. We propose that the
inner envelope is in the process of decoupling from the ambient cloud and
corresponds to the effective mass reservoir (~0.5 M_sun) from which the central
star is being built. Comparison with the rotational properties of other objects
in Taurus suggests that IRAM 04191 is at a pivotal stage between a prestellar
regime of constant angular velocity enforced by magnetic braking and a
dynamical, protostellar regime of nearly conserved angular momentum. The
rotation velocity profile we derive for the inner IRAM 04191 envelope should
thus set some constraints on the distribution of angular momentum on the scale
of the outer Solar system at the onset of protostar/disk formation.

velocities, from a few km/s to at least 40km/s. Along the G and K spectral
regions there is a considerable number of binary systems with moderate to
moderately high rotation rates. This reflects the effects of synchronization
between rotation and orbital motions. These rotators have orbital periods
shorter than about 250 days and circular or nearly circular orbits. Except for
these synchronized systems, the large majority of binary systems with a giant
component of spectral type later than G0III are composed of slow rotators.

different problems such as ramifications, non-determinism and concurrency of

domain and (b) what features of such a representation can affect, and how, its

through a series of controlled experiments, to analyze the computational
performance of reasoning in these representations. The experiments compare
different representations obtained, for example, by changing the basic ontology
of the domain or by varying the degree of use of indirect effect laws through
domain constraints. This study has helped to expose the main sources of
computational difficulty in the reasoning and suggest some methodological
guidelines for representing complex domains. Although our work has been carried
out within one particular high-level description language, we believe that the
results, especially those that relate to the problems of representation, are
independent of the specific modeling language.

field to externally imposed boundary conditions. In reality, however, no
interaction is strong enough to enforce a boundary condition on all frequencies
of a fluctuating field. We construct a more physical model of the situation by
coupling the fluctuating field to a smooth background potential that implements
the boundary condition in a certain limit. To study this problem, we develop
general new methods to compute renormalized one--loop quantum energies and
energy densities. We use analytic properties of scattering data to compute
Green's functions in time--independent background fields at imaginary momenta.
Our calculational method is particularly useful for numerical studies of
singular limits because it avoids terms that oscillate or require cancellation
of exponentially growing and decaying factors. To renormalize, we identify
potentially divergent contributions to the Casimir energy with low orders in
the Born series to the Green's function. We subtract these contributions and
add back the corresponding Feynman diagrams, which we combine with counterterms
fixed by imposing standard renormalization conditions on low--order Green's
functions. The resulting Casimir energy and energy density are finite
functionals for smooth background potentials. In general, however, the Casimir
energy diverges in the boundary condition limit. This divergence is real and
reflects the infinite energy needed to constrain a fluctuating field on all
energy scales; renormalizable quantum field theories have no place for ad hoc
surface counterterms. We apply our methods to simple examples to illustrate
cases where these subtleties invalidate the conclusions of the boundary
condition approach.

$G_M$ corresponding to $\mu$. Regard the direct product $G_N\times G_M$ as a
subgroup of $G_{N+M}$. Let $V$ be the irreducible representation of $G_{N+M}$
corresponding to a partition $\lambda$. Consider the vector space
$W=Hom_{G_M}(U,V)$. It comes with a natural action of the group $G_N$. Let $n$
be sum of parts of $\lambda$ less the sum of parts of $\mu$. For any choice of
a standard Young tableau of skew shape $\lambda/\mu$, we realize $W$ as a
subspace in the tensor product of $n$ copies of the defining $N$-dimensional
representation of $G_N$. This subspace is determined as the image of a certain
linear operator $F(M)$ in the tensor product, given by an explicit formula.
When M=0 and $W=V$ is an irreducible representation of $G_N$, we recover the
classical realization of $V$ as a subspace in the space of all traceless
tensors. Then the operator F(0) can be regarded as the analogue for $G_N$ of
the Young symmetrizer, corresponding to the chosen standard tableau of shape
$\lambda$. Even in the special case M=0, our formula for the operator $F(M)$ is
new. Our results are applications of representation theory of the twisted
Yangian, corresponding to $G_N$. In particular, $F(M)$ is an intertwining
operator between two representations of the twisted Yangian in the $n$-fold
tensor product.

model (SSM), which consists of periodically alternating dispersive and
nonlinear segments, by adding uniformly distributed loss and lumped gain to it.
In the case when the loss is exactly balanced by gain, a family of stable
equilibrium solitons (ESs) is found. Unless the system's period L is very
small, saturation is observed in the dependence of the amplitude of the
established ES vs. that of the initial pulse. Stable nonequilibrium solitons
(NESs) are found in the case when the gain slightly exceeds (by up to 3%) the
value necessary to balance the loss. The existence of NESs is possible as the
excessive energy pump is offset by permanent radiation loss, which is confirmed
by computation of the corresponding Poynting vector. Unlike ESs that form a
continuous family of solutions, NES is an isolated solution, which disappears
in the limit of small L, i.e., it cannot be found in the overpumped nonlinear
Schroedinger equation. Interactions between ESs turn out to be essentially the
same as in SSM without loss and gain, while interactions between NESs are
different: two NESs perturb each other by the radiation jets emanating from
them, even if they are separated by a large distance. Moving NESs survive
collisions, changing their velocities.
