RX J0925.7-4758. The RGS spectrum exhibits a wealth of spectral features from
iron and oxygen. XMM-Newton data confirm the finding of previous Chandra
HETGS/MEG observations that NLTE models of hot white dwarf atmospheres fail to
represent the complex spectrum. There are clear evidences for P Cygni profiles
with wind velocities of up to 2000 km/s. Small flux variations with time scales
larger than 1000s are present. The strongest power is at ~ 0.21d, a period
close to that seen in V band optical light curves. A detailed analysis of the
associated changes in the RGS and EPIC pn spectra hint at a mostly grey
mechanism suggesting a variation of the visibility of the white dwarf due to
occulting material in the accretion disk. Finally, we detect radial velocity
changes of 173 +/- 47 km/s between two RGS observations obtained half an
orbital cycle apart. The amplitude of the RGS velocity shift is consistent with
that of the optical He II 4686 and thus supports the idea that most of the He
II optical line emission arises from the accretion disk.

high-quality VLBI data available. Very accurate data on image positions, fluxes
and deconvolved image sizes provide good constraints for lensing models. We
discuss here the failure of smooth models in fitting the data. Since it is
intuitively clear that the mass of a lens galaxy is not a smooth entity, we
have investigated how deviation from a smooth model can influence lensing
phenomena, especially the image flux ratios. To explore expectations about the
level of substructure in galaxies and its influence on strong lensing, N-body
simulations of a model galaxy are employed. By using the mass distribution of
this model galaxy as a lens, synthetic data sets of different four image system
configurations are generated. Their analysis can possibly provide evidence for
the presence and strong influence of substructure in the primary lens galaxy.

collapse of dense cores condensed out of strongly magnetized molecular clouds.
The dynamically collapsing inflow traps nearly half of the critical magnetic
flux needed for the core support and deposits it in a small region surrounding
the protostar. It has been argued previously that the deposited flux can slow
down the inflow, allowing matter to pile up and settle along field lines into a
magnetically supported, circumstellar disk. Here we show that the disk
typically contains $\sim 10%$ of the stellar mass, and that it could become
self-gravitating under plausible conditions during the rapidly accreting,
``Class 0'' phase of star formation. Subsequent fragmentation of the
self-gravitating, magnetically subcritical disk, driven by magnetic diffusion,
could produce fragments of substellar masses, which collapse to form brown
dwarfs and possibly massive planets. This scenario predicts substellar object
formation at distances of order 100 AU from the central star, although orbital
evolution is possible after formation. It may provide an explanation for the
small, but growing, number of brown dwarf companions found around nearby stars
by direct imaging. The relatively large formation distances make the substellar
companions vulnerable to dynamic ejection, particularly in binary (multiple)
systems and dense clusters. Those ejected may account for, at least in part,
the isolated brown dwarfs and perhaps free-floating planetary mass objects.

characteristic of a set of photoionized ``metals'', located in a section of a
supernova shell illuminated by a GRB emitted a couple of days after the
supernova explosion. We show that the most prominent reported lines coincide
with the ones predicted in the ``cannonball'' model of GRBs. In this model, the
putative signatures are Hydrogen lines, boosted by the (highly relativistic)
motion of the cannonballs (CBs). The corresponding Doppler boost can be
extracted from the fit to the observed I-, R- and V-band light-curves of the
optical afterglow of GRB 011211, so that, since the redshift is also known, the
line energies are --in the CB model-- predicted. We also discuss other GRBs of
known redshift which show spectral features generally interpreted as Fe lines,
or Fe recombination edges. The ensemble of results is very encouraging from the
CB-model's point of view, but the data on each individual GRB are not good
enough to draw (any) objectively decisive conclusions. We outline a strategy
for X-ray observers to search for lines which, in the CB model, move
predictably from higher to lower energies.

the CLF that reproduces the galaxy luminosity function and the luminosity
dependence of the galaxy clustering strength and test the models by comparing
the resulting mass-to-light ratios (M/L) with constraints from the Tully-Fisher
(TF) relation. We obtain a number of stringent constraints on both galaxy
formation and cosmology. In particular, this method can break the degeneracy
between Omega_0 and the power-spectrum normalization sigma_8, inherent in
current weak-lensing and cluster-abundance studies. For flat LCDM cosmogonies
with sigma_8 normalized by recent weak lensing observations, the best results
are obtained for Omega_0~0.3; Omega_0 < 0.2 leads to too large galaxy
correlation lengths, while Omega_0 > 0.4 gives too high M/L. The best-fit model
for the LCDM concordance cosmology (Omega_0=0.3) predicts M/L that are slightly
too high. We discuss a number of possible effects that might remedy this
problem, including small modification of cosmological parameters, warm in stead
of cold dark matter, systematic errors in current observational data, and the
existence of dark galaxies. Finally we use the CLF to predict several
statistics about the distribution of galaxy light in the local Universe.

four damped Ly-alpha systems (DLAs) at redshifts between z_abs = 1.7-2.5 with
the existing HIRES-Keck spectra to undertake a comprehensive study of their
physical conditions and their abundances of up to 15 elements. In this paper,
we present abundance measurements for Mn, Ti and Mg which are among the first
presented in the literature at these redshifts. We confirm the underabundance
of Mn with respect to Fe as observed in lower redshift DLAs and a trend with
decreasing metallicity very similar to the one observed in Galactic metal-poor
stars. This agreement between the Mn/Fe ratios in DLAs and in Galactic stars
suggests that the DLAs and the Milky Way share some similarities in their star
formation histories. However, these similarities must be cautiously interpreted
and investigated in light of all of the elements observed in the DLAs. We have
obtained a first measurement and a significant upper limit of the Ti abundance
at z_abs ~ 2 from the TiII lines at lambda_rest > 3000 A, and we discuss how
the relative abundance of this highly depleted element can be used to prove
unambiguously any enhancement of the abundance of the alpha-elements relative
to Fe-peak elements. We present the abundances of Mg for two DLAs in addition
to the single Mg measurement existing in the literature. Contrary to the trend
expected from differential depletion, the [Mg/Si,S] ratios tend to be
over-solar. The effect is at the level of the measurement errors, but worth
investigating in a larger sample because it could be suggestive of a peculiar
nucleosynthesis effect.

Cam. This includes data from before, during, and after its 1998 outburst. The
object shows a rich emission line spectrum originating from circumstellar
material, rendering it difficult to determine the nature of either star
involved or the cause of the outburst. We collate pre-outburst data to
determine the state of the system before this occurred and provide a baseline
for comparison with later data. During the outburst all lines become stronger,
and hydrogen and helium lines become significantly broader and asymmetric.
After the outburst, spectral changes persist for at least three years, with
FeII and [NII] lines still a factor of ~2 above the pre-outburst level and HeI,
HeII, and NII lines suppressed by a factor of 2-10. We find that the spectral
properties of CI Cam are similar to other sgB[e] stars and therefore suggest
that the geometry of the circumstellar material is similar to that proposed for
the other objects: a two component outflow, with a fast, hot, rarefied polar
wind indistinguishable from that of a normal supergiant and a dense, cooler
equatorial outflow with a much lower velocity. We suggest that CI Cam is among
the hotter members of the class and is viewed nearly pole-on. The nature of the
compact object and the mechanism for the outburst remain uncertain, although it
is likely that the compact object is a black hole or neutron star, and that the
outburst was precipitated by its passage through the equatorial material. We
suggest that this prompted a burst of supercritical accretion resulting in
ejection of much of the material, which was later seen as an expanding radio
remnant. [Abbreviated]

different numerical algorithms for the computation of the force, with or
without the space expansion of cosmological models. Despite these differences
we find in all cases that the non-linear clustering which results is
essentially the same, with a well-defined simple power-law behaviour in the
two-point correlations in the range from a few times the lower cut-off in the
gravitational force to the scale at which fluctuations are of order one. We
argue, presenting quantitative evidence, that this apparently universal
behaviour can be understood by the domination of the small scale contribution
to the gravitational force, coming initially from nearest neighbor particles.

(CV) star, QU Car, observed in time-tag mode at three epochs. In catalogues
this binary is classified as a nova-like variable. We find evidence of a
high-state non-magnetic CV at low inclination, with unusually high ionisation.
We observed narrow absorption lines (few hundred km/s wide) in N V1240, O V1371
and Si IV1398, as well as broader (HWZI ~1000km/s) emission in C III1176, C
IV1549 and He II1640, all with a superposed absorption component. High
ionisation is indicated by the unusually string He II emission and the relative
strength of the O V absorption line. The dereddened UV SED of, on average, -2.3
suggests that disc accretion dominates the spectral energy distribution. In two
observations velocity shifting is noted in the absorption lines on a timescale
long enough not to repeat within the ~2600-sec exposures. The absorption
superposed on the C IV emission line moves coherently with the N V and Si IV
absorption, suggesting the same origin for all absorption lines -- most likely
to be in the accretion disc atmosphere. Weak blueshifted absorption in NV and
C\IV provides evidence of an outflow component and we estimate a maximum
outflow velocity of ~2000km/s. This may be linked to a wind launched from
further out in the disc than is typically seen in those high-state non-magnetic
CV whose wind speeds are observed to reach to >4000km/s. Unusually, three
ionisation stages of carbon -- C II, C III and C IV -- are present in emission,
with line width increasing with higher ionisation. The presence of C II in
emission and the positive line-width/ionisation correlation is most easily
reconciled with an origin in a disc chromosphere, beyond the influence of the
EUV-emitting inner disc.

SMC cluster NGC330 are analysed to obtain their chemical compositions relative
to SMC field and Galactic B-type stars. It is found that all seven stars are
nitrogen rich with an abundance approximately 1.3 dex higher than an SMC
main-sequence field B-type star, AV304. They also display evidence for
deficiencies in carbon, but other metals have abundances typical of the SMC.
Given the number of B-type stars with low rotational projected velocities in
NGC330 (all our targets have vsini < 50 km/s), we suggest that it is unlikely
that the stars in our sample are seen almost pole-on, but rather that they are
intrinsically slow rotators. Furthermore, none of our objects displays any
evidence of significant Balmer emission excluding the possibility that these
are Be stars observed pole-on. Comparing these results with the predictions of
stellar evolution models including the effects of rotationally induced mixing,
we conclude that while the abundance patterns may indeed be reproduced by these
models, serious discrepancies exist. Most importantly, models including the
effects of initially large rotational velocities do not reproduce the observed
range of effective temperatures of our sample, nor the currently observed
rotational velocities. Binary models may be able to produce stars in the
observed temperature range but again may be incapable of producing suitable
analogues with low rotational velocities. We also discuss the clear need for
stellar evolution calculations employing the correct chemical mix of carbon,
nitrogen and oxygen for the SMC.

gravitons creates for any pair of bodies as an attraction force as well an
repulsion force due to pressure of gravitons. For single gravitons, these
forces are approximately balanced, but each of them is much bigger than a force
of Newtonian attraction. If single gravitons are pairing, a body attraction
force due to pressure of such graviton pairs is twice exceeding a corresponding
repulsion force under the condition that graviton pairs are destructed by
collisions with a body. If the considered quantum mechanism of classical
gravity is realized in the nature, then an existence of black holes contradicts
to Einstein's equivalence principle. In such the model, Newton's constant is
proportional to $H^{2}/T^{4},$ where $H$ is the Hubble constant, $T$ is an
equivalent temperature of the graviton background. The estimate of the Hubble
constant is obtained $H=2.14 \cdot 10^{-18} s^{-1}$ (or $66.875 km \cdot s^{-1}

  Lifetimes",,,,,"gr-qc",,"  ECG Stueckelberg (1905-1984) often published important theories years before
those who would receive the Nobel Prize for their discoery. Perhpas other
jewels may remain the work of this prescient genius. In a short paper in
1957--coming shortly on the heels of the suggestion and experimental
confirmation of parity non-conservation by the weak force--Stueckelberg noted
that sine there exist completely antisymmetric four-tensors (e) with covariant
derivative zero, non-parity conserving forces can readily be accomodated by
general relativity as the product of such a tensor and the non-parity
conserving terms. Stueckelberg also pointed out that in classical general
relativity the covariant derivative, D, of e is De=(-g)^1/2*d[e(-g)^-1/2]=0,
where g is the determinant of the metric tensor, and d is an ordinary
derivative. Since g is non-zero, if g is constant, e is a constant and mean
proper particle lifetimes are the same in all Lorenz frames. I point out that
Stueckelberg's paper has three further deep and important implications. (1) We
see how gravity-- matter--can influence particle lifetimes by forcing the e
tensor to be non-constant to have to ""adjust"" so that d[e(-g)^-1/2] is zero,
and we can get some quantitative feel for the magnitude of this effect. (2) If
any difference in the lifetimes of particles and antiparticles are to occur, in
the absence of Lorenz invariance violation, it would be in regions where dg is
non-zero. (3) If indeed, differences in particle and antiparticle lifetimes are
found, before they can be ascibed to effects of quantum gravity, supersymmetry,
or string theory, the effects of classical gravity need to be accounted for.

confronting both terrestrial and space laboratory observations purporting to
probe matter under extreme conditions. We address this question in terms of the
vector susceptibility \chi_V (VSUS in short) and the axial-vector
susceptibility \chi_A (ASUS in short) at the temperature-induced chiral
transition. We consider two possible, albeit simplified, cases that are
contrasting, one that is given by the standard chiral theory where only the
pions figure in the vicinity of the transition and the other that is described
by hidden local symmetry (HLS) theory with the Harada-Yamawaki vector
manifestation (VM) where nearly massless vector mesons also enter. We find that
while in the standard chiral theory, the pion velocity v_\pi proportional to
the ratio of the space component f_\pi^s of the pion decay constant over the
time component f_\pi^t tends to zero near chiral restoration with f_\pi^t\neq
0, in the presence of the vector mesons with vanishing mass, the result is
drastically different: HLS with VM {\it predicts} that \chi_V automatically
equals \chi_A in consistency with chiral invariance and that v_\pi\sim 1$ with
$f_\pi^t\approx f_\pi^s\to 0 as T\to T_c. These results are obtained in the
leading order in power counting but we expect their qualitative features to
remain valid more generally in the chiral limit thanks to the VM point.

decays of the seesaw Majorana neutrinos proposed by Fukugita and Yanagida.
However, in order to avoid the wash-out of the produced lepton number we
propose the production of the Majorana neutrinos to occur non-thermally and
sufficiently late. After this time, in consequence, the B-L (baryon minus
lepton) quantum number becomes a good ``accidental symmetry'' protecting the
asymmetry produced. This non-thermal leptogenesis at late time is realized by a
boson decaying into the Majorana neutrinos with a long lifetime. Suggestively
this boson could correspond to a scalar field which causes the cosmic
inflation, the inflaton, and thus its decay means really the reheating of the
Universe. We find that this mechanism works well even if the lightest Majorana
neutrinos are not produced sufficiently or not present, and the decays of the
heavier seesaw Majorana neutrinos can be responsible to the baryon asymmetry in
the present Universe, as we illustrate by the example of the family replicated
gauge group model.

the star-triangle relation, may (and should) be viewed as a generalization of

first-passage times. This approach incorporates information of all possible
reaction events as well as the effect of temperature. The method is applied to
exemplary reactions in a continuous and in a discrete setting. The suggested
approach holds great promise for large reaction networks that are completely
characterized by the method through a pathway graph.

Monte Carlo or Path Integral Monte Carlo are the most accurate and general
methods for computing total electronic energies. We will review methods we have
developed to perform QMC for the electrons coupled to a classical Monte Carlo
simulation of the ions. In this method, one estimates the Born-Oppenheimer
energy E(Z) where Z represents the ionic degrees of freedom. That estimate of
the energy is used in a Metropolis simulation of the ionic degrees of freedom.
Important aspects of this method are how to deal with the noise, which QMC
method and which trial function to use, how to deal with generalized boundary
conditions on the wave function so as to reduce the finite size effects. We
discuss some advantages of the CEIMC method concerning how the quantum effects
of the ionic degrees of freedom can be included and how the boundary conditions
can be integrated over. Using these methods, we have performed simulations of
liquid H2 and metallic H on a parallel computer.

algorithms. We show how one can arrive at equations on such algebras which
define n-dimensional Hilbert space subspaces which in turn can simulate quantum
systems on a quantum system. In doing so we use MMP diagrams and linear
algorithms. MMP diagrams are tractable since an n-block of an MMP diagram has n
elements while an n-block of a standard lattice diagram has 2^n elements. An
immediate test for such an approach is a generation of minimal and arbitrary
Kochen-Specker vectors and we present a minimal state-independent
Kochen-Specker set of seven vectors from a Hilbert space with more than four

$B(\mathcal{H})$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is a separable Hilbert space, the quantum
fidelity is denoted by $a*b =(b^{1/2}ab^{1/2})^{1/2}$. One of the aim of this
let ter is to interpret the quantum fidelity as an algebraic law. We remark
that if $a,b,c$ are three positive operators whi ch commute pairwise, the law *
becomes self-distributive, i.e. the third Reidemeister movement in knot theory
is verif ied. We study the converse. Let three positive operators be given,
does the fact that the third Reidemeister movement between them is possible
implie that they commute pairwise ? Though in general we only conjecture it for
the moment, we prove it in some par ticular but important cases. Should this
movement be not possible, we interpret it as an obstruction to comm utativity.
We give also new examples of quandle algebras and left distributive systems and
study the generalisation of Ito maps.

to a continuous model of conscious brain states that cannot precisely resolve
eigenvalues. If two apparatus states are in superposition, and if their
eigenvalues are so close together that they cannot be consciously resolved on
this model, then it is shown that observation will not generally reduce the
superposition to just one of its member eigenstates. In general, the
observation of a quantum mechanical superposition results in another
superposition. Key words: Brain states, consciousness, conscious observer,
