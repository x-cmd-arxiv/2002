phenomenon. Magnetic fields generated at the base of the convection zone follow
a chaotic evolution before reaching the solar surface. In this article, we use
a 2-D probabilistic Cellular Automaton (CA) to model the statistical properties
of the magnetic patterns formed on the solar surface and to estimate the
magnetic energy released in the interaction of opposite polarities. We assume
that newly emerged magnetic flux tubes stimulate the emergence of new magnetic
flux in their neighborhood. The flux-tubes move randomly on the surface of the
sun, and they cancel and release their magnetic energy when they collide with
magnetic flux of opposite polarity, or diffuse into the ``empty'' photosphere.
We assume that cancellation of magnetic flux in collisions causes ""flares"" and
determine the released energy as the difference in the square of the magnetic
field flux. The statistics of the simulated ""flares"" follow a power-law
distribution in energy, with power-law index a=2.2 +/- 0.1. The size
distribution function of the simulated active regions exhibits a power law
behavior with index k = 1.93 +/- 0.08, and the fractal dimension of the
magnetized areas on the simulated solar surface is close to D = 1.42 +/- 0.12.
Both quantities, D and k, are inside the range of the observed values.

the soft excess is modeled as a separate black-body or thermal bremsstrahlung
type component, pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of SMC X-1 shows that the
soft component also has a pulsating nature. Same may be true for LMC X-4,
though a very small pulse fraction limits the statistical significance. The
pulsating soft component is found to have a nearly sinusoidal profile,
dissimilar to the complex profile seen at higher energies, which can be an
effect of smearing. Due to very high luminosity of these sources, the size of
the emission zone required for the soft component is large (radius ~300-400
km). We show that the pulsating nature of the soft component is difficult to
explain if a thermal origin is assumed for it. We further investigated with
alternate models, like inversely broken power-law or two different power-law
components and found that these models can also be used to explain the excess
at low energy. A soft power-law component may be a common feature of the
accreting X-ray pulsars, which is difficult to detect because most of the HMXB
pulsars are in the Galactic plane and experience large interstellar absorption.
In LMC X-4, we have also measured two additonal mid-eclipse times, which
confirm the known orbital decay.

effect approximates that of Einstein's cosmological constant, Lambda; nowadays
the concept is termed dark energy or quintessence. Physics also suggests the
dark energy could be dynamical, allowing the arguably appealing picture that
the dark energy density is evolving to its natural value, zero, and is small
now because the expanding universe is old. This alleviates the classical
problem of the curious energy scale of order a millielectronvolt associated
with a constant Lambda. Dark energy may have been detected by recent advances
in the cosmological tests. The tests establish a good scientific case for the
context, in the relativistic Friedmann-Lemaitre model, including the
gravitational inverse square law applied to the scales of cosmology. We have
well-checked evidence that the mean mass density is not much more than one
quarter of the critical Einstein-de Sitter value. The case for detection of
dark energy is serious but not yet as convincing; we await more checks that may
come out of work in progress. Planned observations might be capable of
detecting evolution of the dark energy density; a positive result would be a
considerable stimulus to attempts to understand the microphysics of dark
energy. This review presents the basic physics and astronomy of the subject,
reviews the history of ideas, assesses the state of the observational evidence,

that LiH may be detectable by the future sub-mm array project, ALMA; its
expected flux is at the mJy level and the line width is about $10^5$ Hz.
Although typical galactic USOs are chemically and dynamically transient, the
younger USOs will be recognisable via LiH emission if about a hundred USOs are
observed. If USOs are confirmed to be of galactic origin, the total baryonic

have revealed significantly less cool gas than predicted indicating that the
mass deposition rate of cooling flows is much lower than expected. However,
most cooling flow clusters host an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) at their
centres. AGN can inflate large bubbles of hot plasma that subsequently rise
through the cluster atmosphere, thus stirring this gas. Here we report on the
results from highly resolved hydrodynamic simulations which for the first time
show that buoyant bubbles increase the cooling time in the inner cluster
regions and thereby significantly reduce the deposition of cold gas. This work
demonstrates that the action of AGN in the centres of cooling flow clusters can
explain the observed absence of large quantities of cooled gas.

at all wavelengths. BeppoSAX observations made in 1998, non-simultaneously with

shape of the high energy blazar component, which we attribute to inverse
Compton scattering. The optical-to-gamma-ray spectral energy distributions at
the different epochs show that the gamma-ray luminosity dominates the

emission, suggests that, besides the synchrotron self-Compton mechanism, the
Compton upscattering of photons external to the jet (e.g., in the broad line
region) may have a significant role for high energy radiation. The
multiwavelength variability can be reproduced by changes of the plasma bulk
Lorentz factor. The spectrum secured by IUE in 1995 appears to be partially

Earth, produced in events similar to those observed, can exceed the detection
threshold of a km^2 neutrino detector. Sources with bulk Lorentz factors larger
than those characteristic of the sample considered here, directed along our
line of sight may be very difficult to resolve at radio wavelengths and hence
may be difficult to identify as microqusar candidates. However these sources
can be identified through their neutrino and gamma-ray emission.

well-separated from the surrounding field and the velocity dispersions range
from ~350-850 km/s. Emission line galaxies in these clusters are relatively
rare, comprising only 22 +/- 4% of the sample. There is no evidence that these
emission-line galaxies are dynamically distinct from the majority of the
cluster population, though our sample is too small to rule out the ~30%
difference that has been observed in more massive clusters. We find eleven
galaxies, comprising 6% of the cluster members, which are disk-dominated but
show no sign of emission in their spectrum. Most of these are relatively
isolated, spiral galaxies with smooth disks. We find no cluster members with a
starburst or post-starburst spectrum. The striking similarity between the
spectral and morphological properties of galaxies in these clusters and those
of galaxies in more massive systems at similar redshifts implies that the
physical processes responsible for truncating star formation in galaxies are
not restricted to the rare, rich cluster environment, but are viable in much
more common environments. In particular, we conclude that ram pressure
stripping or cluster-induced starbursts cannot be solely responsible for the
low star formation rates in these systems.

The model is a generalization of the conventional Hubbard model that allows for
the fact that the wavefunction for two electrons occupying the same Wannier
orbital is different from the product of single electron wavefunctions. We
diagonalize the Hamiltonian exactly on a four-site cluster and study its
properties as function of band filling. The quasiparticle weight is found to
decrease and the quasiparticle effective mass to increase as the electronic
band filling increases, and spectral weight in one- and two-particle spectral
functions is transfered from low to high frequencies as the band filling
increases. Quasiparticles at the Fermi energy are found to be more 'dressed'
when the Fermi level is in the upper half of the band (hole carriers) than when
it is in the lower half of the band (electron carriers). The effective
interaction between carriers is found to be strongly dependent on band filling
becoming less repulsive as the band filling increases, and attractive near the
top of the band in certain parameter ranges. The effective interaction is most
attractive when the single hole carriers are most heavily dressed, and in the
parameter regime where the effective interaction is attractive, hole carriers
are found to 'undress', hence become more like electrons, when they pair. It is
proposed that these are generic properties of electronic energy bands in solids
that reflect a fundamental electron-hole asymmetry of condensed matter. The
relation of these results to the understanding of superconductivity in solids
is discussed.

features in the Coulomb drag between them that are absent in the drag between

of Coulomb drag between ballistic one-dimensional electron systems, and give a
brief summary of the experimental work reported so far on one-dimensional drag.
Both the Fermi liquid (FL) and the Luttinger liquid (LL) theory predict a
maximum of the drag resistance R_D when the one-dimensional subbands of the two
quantum wires are aligned and the Fermi wave vector k_F is small, and also an
exponential decay of R_D with increasing inter-wire separation, both features
confirmed by experimental observations. A crucial difference between the two
theoretical models emerges in the temperature dependence of the drag effect.
Whereas the FL theory predicts a linear temperature dependence, the LL theory
promises a rich and varied dependence on temperature depending on the relative
magnitudes of the energy and length scales of the systems. At higher
temperatures, the drag should show a power-law dependence on temperature, $R_D
\~ T^x$, experimentally confirmed in a narrow temperature range, where x is
determined by the Luttinger liquid parameters. The spin degree of freedom plays
an important role in the LL theory in predicting the features of the drag
effect and is crucial for the interpretation of experimental results.

concern is to investigate the influence of the nonlinearity of W(t) on the
probability P to remain in the initial state. The dimensionless quantity
epsilon = pi Delta ^2/(2 hbar v) depends on the coupling Delta of both levels
and on the sweep rate v. For fast sweep rates, i.e., epsilon << l and
monotonic, analytic sweep functions linearizable in the vicinity of the
resonance we find the transition probability 1-P ~= epsilon (1+a), where a>0 is
the correction to the LSZ result due to the nonlinearity of the sweep. Further
increase of the sweep rate with nonlinearity fixed brings the system into the
nonlinear-sweep regime characterized by 1-P ~= epsilon ^gamma with gamma neq 1
depending on the type of sweep function. In case of slow sweep rates, i.e.,
epsilon >>1 an interesting interference phenomenon occurs. For analytic W(t)
the probability P=P_0 e^-eta is determined by the singularities of sqrt{Delta
^2+W^2(t)} in the upper complex plane of t. If W(t) is close to linear, there
is only one singularity, that leads to the LZS result P=e^-epsilon with
important corrections to the exponent due to nonlinearity. However, for, e.g.,
W(t) ~ t^3 there is a pair of singularities in the upper complex plane.
Interference of their contributions leads to oscillations of the prefactor P_0
that depends on the sweep rate through epsilon and turns to zero at some
epsilon. Measurements of the oscillation period and of the exponential factor
would allow to determine Delta, independently.

the inspiral phase of binary systems when the orbital plane precesses due to
relativistic spin-orbit coupling. Such effect takes place when the spins of the
binary members are misaligned with respect to the orbital angular momentum. As
a first step we assess the importance of precession specifically for the
first-generation of LIGO detectors. We investigate the extent of the
signal-to-noise ratio reduction and, hence, detection rate that occurs when
precession effects are not accounted for in the template waveforms. We restrict
our analysis to binary systems that undergo the so-called simple precession and
have a total mass close to 10 solar mass. We find that for binary systems with
rather high mass ratios (e.g., a 1.4 solar mass neutron star and a 10 solar
mass black hole) the detection rate can decrease by almost an order of
magnitude. Current astrophysical estimates of the rate of binary inspiral
events suggest that LIGO could detect at most a few events per year, and
therefore the reduction of the detection rate even by a factor of a few is
critical. In the second part of our analysis, we examine whether the effect of
precession could be included in the templates by capturing the main features of
the phase modulation through a small number of extra parameters. Specifically
we examine and tested for the first time the 3-parameter family suggested by
Apostolatos. We find that, even though these ``mimic'' templates improve the
detection rate, they are still inadequate in recovering the signal-to-noise
ratio at the desired level. We conclude that a more complex template family is
needed in the near future, still maintaining the number of additional
parameters as small as possible in order to reduce the computational costs.

  Constrained Quantization on the SU(2) and SO(3) manifolds","revtex4, 16 pages, no figures",,,,"hep-ph gr-qc hep-th nucl-th quant-ph",,"  In the Skyrme model, the Lagrangian can be quantized in several ways using
the collective coordinate approach. Not all of which produce quantum states
that can be interpreted as physical particles. For example the SU(2) collective
coordinate approach produces both integral and half-integral spin and isospin
states. Only half of these are the physical baryons. Less well known is the
fact that it is equally possible to quantize the system using the SO(3)
collective coordinates. This produces only unphysical integral spin and isospin
states. To fulfill the goal of being able to express a classical skyrmion as a
coherent state of baryons directly in terms of the baryon states, surprisingly
a combination of both collective coordinate approaches is required. To prepare
for the subsequent application to skyrmion formation through disoriented chiral
condensates in heavy ion collisions, the Skyrme model is rigorously quantized
using the Dirac prescription for constrained systems. This is shown for both
the SU(2) as well as the SO(3) collective coordinate approach.

disoriented chiral condensates formation from heavy ion collisions, the direct
relation of a classical skyrmion to baryon states is examined. It is argued
that a skyrmion is a coherent state of baryons. The collective coordinate
approach of quantization means that the physical baryon states exist not in
flat space but on a compact manifold. This requires the construction of
coherent states in such a curve space. Using the techniques associated with the
Segal-Bargmann transform also known as the coherent state transform used for
example in the study of the classical limit of quantum gravity, such states can
be constructed in the context of the Skyrme model. They are made up directly of
baryon states on S^3 but with quantum operators on the SO(3) manifold. In terms
of wavefunctions, they are a superposition of the analytic baryon wavefunctions
of Adkins, Nappi and Witten. The distribution of the baryon states in terms of
the relative probabilities of the baryons inside a skyrmion can therefore be
determined.

are calculated, the results are similar to the current theory if the
renormalizations of high order processes are not considered. When mass
renormalizations are taken into account, for some high order perturbation
processes of electromagnetic interaction, C, T violations would be caused.
Meanwhile, the renormalization process of a single third order vertex angle of
electromagnetic interaction in momentum space also would violate P symmetry,
which leads to parity non-conservation for some high order electromagnetic
decays. But in the coordinate space for the sum of all third order vertex angle
processes, P symmetry still holds. Under the united CPT transformation, the
Hamiltonians of strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions in the coordinate
space are invariable with a completely symmetrical form. The Compton scattering
of positive electron is suggested to verify the existence of C violation in the
high order mass renormalization processes of electromagnetic interaction. The T
violation in renormalization process can be used to explain the reversibility
paradox in the non-equilibrium evolution processes of macro-systems. The CP
violation may also be used to explain the problem of positive and

chosen plaquettes (occuring with concentration p) have couplings with the
``wrong sign'' so that magnetic flux is energetically favored on these
plaquettes. Excitations of the model are one-dimensional ``flux tubes'' that
terminate at ``magnetic monopoles.'' Electric confinement can be driven by
thermal fluctuations of the flux tubes, by the quenched background of magnetic
monopoles, or by a combination of the two. Like the RBIM, the RPGM has enhanced
symmetry along a ``Nishimori line'' in the p-T plane (where T is the
temperature). The critical concentration p_c of wrong-sign plaquettes at the
confinement-Higgs phase transition along the Nishimori line can be identified
with the accuracy threshold for robust storage of quantum information using
topological error-correcting codes: if qubit phase errors, qubit bit-flip
errors, and errors in the measurement of local check operators all occur at
rates below p_c, then encoded quantum information can be protected perfectly
from damage in the limit of a large code block. Numerically, we measure p_{c0},
the critical concentration along the T=0 axis (a lower bound on p_c), finding
p_{c0}=.0293 +/- .0002. We also measure the critical concentration of
antiferromagnetic bonds in the two-dimensional RBIM on the T=0 axis, finding

communication complexity of protocols that operate with incomplete information,

formalism which includes dispersive effects, such as group velocity and group
velocity dispersion (GVD). When dispersion is negligible, the analysis is

a modulated instantaneous susceptibility of the medium. The effect of the
time-varying susceptibility on a probe laser pulse is two-fold: the output
frequency becomes modulated because of the time-varying phase velocity, and the
pulse shape becomes deformed because of the time-varying group velocity. We
identify two mechanisms for pulse compression: (1) Frequency chirping with
subsequent pulse compression by normal linear GVD (possibly in the same medium)
and (2) Compression due to the time-varying group velocity. We analyze various
aspects of pulse compression in the coherent Raman medium and derive
conservation relations for this process. When we consider a probe laser pulse
which is much shorter than the molecular oscillation period, we observe
frequency chirping, compression, or stretching of this pulse, depending on its
relative timing with respect to the molecular oscillations. Based on our
analysis, we propose a method for selective compression or frequency conversion
