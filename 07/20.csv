(EGRB) filling the Universe remains unknown. The spectrum of this extragalactic
radiation, as measured by the EGRET on-board CGRO, is well-fit by a power law
across nearly four decades in energy, from 30 MeV to 100 GeV. It has been
estimated that not more than a quarter of the diffuse gamma-ray background
could be due to unresolved point sources. Recent studies have suggested that
much of the diffuse background could originate from the up-scatter of CMB
photons by relativistic electrons produced by shock waves in the IGM during
large-scale structure formation. In this work we search for evidence of
gamma-ray emission associated with galaxy clusters by cross-correlating high
Galactic latitude EGRET data with Abell clusters. Our results indicate a
possible association of emission with clusters at a >3-sigma level. For a
subset of the 447 richest (R>=2) clusters the mean surface brightness excess is
1.2x10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 (>100MeV), corresponding to a typical non-thermal
bolometric luminosity of L_{gamma} ~ 1x10^44 erg s^-1. Extrapolating this
measurement and assuming no evolution we conservatively estimate that ~ 1-10 of
the EGRB could originate from clusters with z<1. For this cluster population
the predicted non-thermal luminosity is in excellent agreement with our
measurement, suggesting that the clusters have experienced mass accretion
within the last 10^9 yrs. If correct, then future gamma-ray missions, such as
GLAST should be able to directly detect nearby galaxy clusters.

0.5 seconds and 1.2 minutes respectively, well within the ~1sigma errors. The
phase dependence of the intensity and color implies that heating of a tidally
locked companion causes the observed variations. The eclipsing nature of this
MSP in the radio, combined with the relatively large companion mass (> 0.13
solar masses) and the companion's position in the color-magnitude diagram,
suggest that the companion is a main sequence star, a rare circumstance for an
MSP companion. This system is likely to have had a complex evolution and
represents an interesting case study in MSP irradiation of a close companion.
We present evidence for another optical variable with similar properties to the
companion of 47 Tuc W. This variable may also be an MSP companion, although no

estimates of the external pressure and density distributions from Chandra

the variations of pressure and density along the jets and show that there are
self-consistent solutions for deceleration by injection of thermal matter. We
initially take the jets to be in pressure equilibrium with the external medium
at large distances from the nucleus and the momentum flux to be energy flux/c;
we then progressively relax these constraints. We infer that the jets are
over-pressured compared with the external medium where they start to expand
rapidly. Local minima in the density and pressure and maxima in the mass
injection rate and Mach number occur at approximately 3 kpc. Further out, the
jets decelerate smoothly with a Mach number close to 1. The mass injection rate
we infer is comparable with that expected from stellar mass loss at 1 - 2 kpc,
but significantly exceeds it at large distances. We conclude that entrainment
from the galactic atmosphere is the dominant mass input process far from the
nucleus, but that stellar mass loss may also contribute closer in. The
occurrence of a significant over-pressure where expansion begins leads us to
suggest that there is a stationary shock system, perhaps caused by
reconfinement of an initially free jet. Our results are compatible with a jet
consisting of electron-positron plasma on parsec scales which picks up thermal
matter from stellar mass loss to reach the inferred density and mass flux at 1
kpc, but we cannot rule out an electron-proton composition with a low-energy
cut-off. [Abridged]

make NGC5506 the first identified case of an optically-obscured NLSy1. This new

e.g., NGC5506 is unusual in hosting both a `type 1' AGN and a nuclear water

study at wavebands less affected by obscuration.

populations sampled, we find that the majority of the 18 X-ray detected
emission-line galaxies (ELGs) have radio and mid-infrared ISOCAM counterparts
and appear to be luminous star-forming galaxies at z=0.3-1.3. Importantly, the
radio-detected ELGs make up ~35% of the X-ray source population at 0.5-8.0 keV
X-ray fluxes between ~(1-5)x10e-16 erg/cm2/s and signal the emergence of the
luminous, high-z starburst galaxy population in the X-ray band. We find that
the locally-determined correlation between X-ray luminosities and 1.4 GHz radio
luminosity densities of the late-type galaxies can easily be extended to
include the luminous intermediate-redshift ELGs, suggesting that the X-ray and
radio emission processes are generally associated in star-forming galaxies.
This result implies that the X-ray emission can be used as an indicator of star
formation rate for star-forming galaxies. Finally, we show that there appear to
be two statistically distinct types of ISOCAM-detected star-forming galaxies:
those with detectable radio and X-ray emission and those without. The latter

detectability at mid-infrared wavelengths.

stellar progenitor in the collapsar model for gamma-ray bursts. In agreement
with previous studies, we find that relativistic jets are collimated by their
passage through the stellar mantle. Interaction of these jets with the star and
their own cocoons also causes mixing that sporadically decelerates the flow. We
speculate that this mixing instability is chiefly responsible for the variable
Lorentz factor needed in the internal shock model and for the complex light
curves seen in many GRBs. In all cases studied, the jet is shocked deep inside
the star following a brief period of adiabatic expansion. The jet that finally
emerges from the star thus has a moderate Lorentz factor, modulated by mixing,
and a very large internal energy. In a second series of calculations, we follow
the escape of that sort of jet. Because of the large ratio of internal to
kinetic energy in both the jet and its cocoon, the opening angle of the final
jet is significantly greater than at breakout. A small amount of material
emerges at large angles, but with a Lorentz factor still sufficiently large to
make a weak GRB. This leads us to propose a ""unified model"" in which a variety
of high energy transients, ranging from x-ray flashes to ""classic"" GRBs, may be
seen depending upon the angle at which a standard collapsar is observed. We
also speculate that the breakout of a relativistic jet and its collision with
the stellar wind will produce a brief transient with properties similar to the
class of ""short-hard"" GRBs. Implications of our calculations for GRB light
curves, the luminosity-variability relation, and the GRB-supernova association

H-band afterglow, which exhibits an earlier power law decay but a much faster
decay about one day after the burst. Two possible geometries of the
afterglow-emitting regions are suggested: 1) afterglow emission produced by the
impact of the fireball on the surrounding torus, which serves as the absorbing
material of the X-ray feature, as would be expected in the models involving
that a supernova explosion precedes the gamma-ray burst by some time;
2)afterglow emission produced in the dense circum-burst medium inside the
torus. In case 1), the faster decay at the later time is attributed to the
disappearance of the shock due to the counter-pressure in the hot torus
illuminated by the burst and afterglow photons. For case 2), the circum-burst
medium density is found to be very high ($n\ga 10^4-10^5 {\rm cm^{-3}}$) if the
emitting plasma is a jet or even higher if it is spherical. Future better
observations of afterglows of GRBs that have absorption features might make it

  G. Hasinger, Th. Boller and A. Parmar, MPE report",,,,"astro-ph",,"  X-ray Polarimetry is almost as old as X-ray Astronomy. Since the first
discovery of X-ray sources theoretical analysis suggested that a high degree of
linear polarization could be expected due either to the, extremely non thermal,
emission mechanism or to the transfer of radiation in highly asymmetric
systems. The actual implementation of this subtopic was, conversely, relatively
deceiving. This is mainly due to the limitation of the conventional techniques
based on the Bragg diffraction at 45deg, or on Thomson scattering around 90deg.
Acually no X-ray Polarimeter has been launched since 25 years. Nevertheless the
expectations from such measurement on several astrophysical targets including
High and Low Mass X-Ray Binaries, isolated neutron Stars, Galactic and
Extragalactic Black Holes is extremely attractive. We developed a new technique
to measure the linear polarization of X-ray sources. It is based on the
visualization of photoelectron tracks in a, finely subdivided, gas filled
detector (micropattern). The initial direction of the photoelectron is derived
and from the angular distribution of the tracks the amount and angle of
polarization is computed. This technique can find an optimal exploitation in
the focus of XEUS-1. Even in a very conservative configuration (basically the
already existing prototype) the photoelectric polarimeter could perform
polarimetry at % level on many AGNs. Further significant improvements can be
expected from a technological development on the detector and with the use of
XEUS-2 telescope.

a comparatively small fraction of the total permittivity epsilon', but chi""U is
the dominant contribution to the losses in a wide frequency-temperature range

behavior is observed for all the three compositions studied. The universal
relaxor susceptibility is attributed to the polarization of polar nanoregions,
which are inherent in the relaxor ferroelectrics. A microscopic model of this
polarization is proposed, according to which the dipole moments of some
('free') unit cells inside polar nanoregion can freely choose several different
directions, while the direction of the total moment of the nanoregion remains
the same. The ensemble of interacting polar nanoregions is described in terms

that the classical vacuum structure differs considerably from the four

vacuum-matter boundary and extra dimensions places interesting restrictions on
the wormhole. For example, in the static case, the radial size of a weak energy
condition (WEC) respecting throat is restricted by the extra dimensions. There
is a critical dimension, D=5, where this restriction is eliminated. In the time
dependent case, one \emph{cannot} respect the WEC at the throat as the time

considerably from the static case and the four dimensional case.

acceptable even with universal boundary conditions. It is shown that this
extended model possesses a classically flat ""shifted"" trajectory which acquires
a slope via one-loop radiative corrections and can be used as inflationary
path. The constraints from the cosmic background explorer can be met with

group is already broken on the ""shifted"" path. The relevant part of inflation
takes place at values of the inflaton field which are not much smaller than the

invalidate inflation. It is, however, shown that inflation can be kept intact

value, which originates from D-terms, is introduced and a specific form of the
Kaehler potential is used. Moreover, it is found that, although the

unstable at zero temperature: Z strings decay by exciting charged Higgs modes.
In the early Universe, however, there was a long period during which the Higgs
particles were out of equilibrium but the photon field was in thermal
equilibrium. We show that in this phase Z strings are stabilized by
interactions of the charged Higgs modes with the photons. In a first
temperature range immediately below the electroweak symmetry breaking scale,
the stabilized embedded defects are symmetric in internal space (the charged
scalar fields are not excited). There is a second critical temperature below
which the stabilized embedded strings undergo a core phase transition and the
charged scalar fields take on a nonvanishing value in the core of the strings.
We show that stabilized embedded defects with an asymmetric core persist to
very low temperatures. The stabilization mechanism discussed in this paper is a
prototypical example of a process which will apply to a wider class of embedded
defects in gauge theories.

two-dimensional quantum Hall systems in a finite, periodic box at very low

time-independent term $\sigma_{xy}$ corresponding to the Hall conductance and
the linearly time-dependent term $\gamma_{sy}\cdot t$ in the transverse and
longitudinal directions $s=x,y$ in a slow switching limit for adiabatically
applying the initial electric field. The latter terms $\gamma_{sy}\cdot t$ are
due to the acceleration of the electrons by the uniform electric field in the
finite and isolated system, and so the time-independent term $\sigma_{yy}$
corresponding to the diagonal conductance always vanishes. The well known
topological argument yields the integral and fractional quantization of the
averaged Hall conductance $\bar{\sigma_{xy}}$ over gauge parameters under the
assumption on the existence of a spectral gap above the ground state. In
addition to this fact, we show that the averaged acceleration coefficients
$\bar{\gamma_{sy}}$ are vanishing under the same assumption. In the
non-interacting case, the spectral gap between the neighbouring Landau levels
persists if the vector and the electrostatic potentials together satisfy a
certain condition, and then the Hall conductance $\sigma_{xy}$ without
averaging exhibits the exact integral quantization in the infinite volume limit
with the vanishing acceleration coefficients. We also estimate their finite
size corrections. In the interacting case, the averaged Hall conductance
$\bar{\sigma_{xy}}$ for a non-integer filling of the electrons is quantized to
a fraction not equal to an integer under the assumption that the potentials
satisfy certain conditions in addition to the gap assumption.

specified by the difference map, solutions are associated with fixed points of
the map, the attractive character of which determines the effectiveness of the
algorithm. The behavior of the difference map near fixed points is controlled
by the relative orientation of the tangent spaces of the two constraint
subspaces employed by the map. Since the dimensionalities involved are always
large in practical applications, it is appropriate to use random matrix theory
ideas to analyze the average-case convergence at fixed points. Optimal values
of the gamma parameters of the difference map are found which differ somewhat

leads to a limit system of parabolic type. The analysis is carried out by using
the following steps:
  (i) We single out algebraic ``structure conditions'' on the full system,
motivated by formal asymptotics, by some examples of discrete velocity models
in kinetic theories.
  (ii) We deduce ``energy estimates'', uniformly in epsilon, by assuming the
existence of a symmetrizer having the so called block structure and by assuming
``dissipativity conditions'' on B.
  (iii) We perform the convergence analysis by using generalizations of
Compensated Compactness due to Tartar and Gerard.

prescribed general quasilinear parabolic systems, satisfying Petrowski

academic levels often construct a conceptual framework in which the ideas of
absolute simultaneity and the relativity of simultaneity co-exist. This article
describes the development and assessment of instructional materials intended to
improve student understanding of the concept of time in special relativity, the
relativity of simultaneity, and the role of observers in inertial reference
frames. Results from pretests and post-tests are presented to demonstrate the
effect of the curriculum in helping students deepen their understanding of
these topics. Excerpts from taped interviews and classroom interactions help
illustrate the intense cognitive conflict that students encounter as they are
led to confront the incompatibility of their deeply-held beliefs about
simultaneity with the results of special relativity.

computer scientists and mathematicians, with only occasional asides to their
teacher. Physicists uninterested in quantum pedagogy may be amused (or
irritated) by some of the views of standard quantum mechanics that arise
naturally from this unorthodox perspective.

  ref added; v4: clarification of assumption re logic gates",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.68.042322",,"quant-ph",,"  Fault tolerant quantum error correction (QEC) networks are studied by a
combination of numerical and approximate analytical treatments. The probability
of failure of the recovery operation is calculated for a variety of CSS codes,
including large block codes and concatenated codes. Recent insights into the
syndrome extraction process, which render the whole process more efficient and
more noise-tolerant, are incorporated. The average number of recoveries which
can be completed without failure is thus estimated as a function of various
parameters. The main parameters are the gate (gamma) and memory (epsilon)
failure rates, the physical scale-up of the computer size, and the time t_m
required for measurements and classical processing. The achievable computation
size is given as a surface in parameter space. This indicates the noise
threshold as well as other information. It is found that concatenated codes
based on the [[23,1,7]] Golay code give higher thresholds than those based on
the [[7,1,3]] Hamming code under most conditions. The threshold gate noise
gamma_0 is a function of epsilon/gamma and t_m; example values are
{epsilon/gamma, t_m, gamma_0} = {1, 1, 0.001}, {0.01, 1, 0.003}, {1, 100,
0.0001}, {0.01, 100, 0.002}, assuming zero cost for information transport. This
represents an order of magnitude increase in tolerated memory noise, compared
with previous calculations, which is made possible by recent insights into the
fault-tolerant QEC process.

become entangled through interaction with a thermalized partner? We address
this question here. In particular, we consider the question of how mixed a
two-level system and a field mode may be such that free entanglement arises in
the course of the time evolution according to a Jaynes-Cummings type
interaction. We investigate the situation for which the two-level system is
initially in mixed state taken from a one-parameter set, whereas the field has
been prepared in an arbitrary thermal state. Depending on the particular choice
for the initial state and the initial temperature of the quantised field mode,
three cases can be distinguished: (i) free entanglement will be created
immediately, (ii) free entanglement will be generated, but only at a later time
different from zero, (iii) the partial transpose of the joint state remains
positive at all times. It will be demonstrated that increasing the initial
temperature of the field mode may cause the joint state to become distillable
during the time evolution, in contrast to a non-distillable state at lower
initial temperatures. We further assess the generated entanglement
quantitatively, by evaluating the logarithmic negativity numerically, and by
providing an analytical upper bound.

a position measurement and the momentum disturbance caused by that measurement
should be no less than the limit set by Planck's constant, hbar/2, as
demonstrated by Heisenberg's thought experiment using a gamma-ray microscope.
Here I show that this common assumption is false: a universally valid trade-off
relation between the noise and the disturbance has an additional correlation
term, which is redundant when the intervention brought by the measurement is
independent of the measured object, but which allows the noise-disturbance
product much below Planck's constant when the intervention is dependent. A
model of measuring interaction with dependent intervention shows that
Heisenberg's lower bound for the noise-disturbance product is violated even by
a nearly nondisturbing, precise position measuring instrument. An experimental
implementation is also proposed to realize the above model in the context of
optical quadrature measurement with currently available linear optical devices.
