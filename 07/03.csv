fashionable ``black box'' cosmological parameter analysis, constraining
cosmological models in a more physically intuitive fashion by mapping
measurements of CMB, weak lensing and cluster abundance into k-space, where
they can be directly compared with each other and with galaxy and Lyman alpha
forest clustering. Including the new CBI results, we find that CMB measurements
of P(k) overlap with those from 2dF galaxy clustering by over an order of

describe how our approach can be used to raise the ambition level beyond
cosmological parameter fitting as data improves, testing rather than assuming

decreases with increasing jet powers, and that it also anti-correlates with the

for BL Lacs and low-power radio galaxies in the radio and X-ray band to Gamma ~

agreement with results from independent methods. We find that the correlations
between Ca H&K break and radio core and X-ray luminosity hold independently for
low- (LBL) and high-energy peaked BL Lacs (HBL). We derive average viewing

toward cooler temperatures with time, never reaching optically thin conditions

peaked at DeltaV=9 mag, with the outburst evolution being characterized by a
fast rise, three maxima over four months, and a fast decay (possibly driven by
dust condensation in the ejecta). BaII, LiI and s-element lines were prominent
in the outburst spectra. Strong and wide (500 km/sec) P-Cyg profiles affected
low ionization species, while Balmer lines emerged to modest emission only
during the central phase of the outburst. A light-echo discovered expanding
around the object constrains its distance to 790+/-30 pc, providing M_V=+4.45
in quiescence and M_V=-4.35 at optical maximum (dependent on the still
uncertain E(B-V)=0.5 reddening). The visible progenitor resembled a somewhat
under-luminous F0 main sequence star, that did not show detectable variability
over the last half century. V838 Mon together with M31-RedVar and V4332 Sgr
seems to define a new class of astronomical objects: stars that erupt into cool
supergiants (SECS). They do not develop optically thin or nebular phases, and
deep P-Cyg profiles denounce large mass loss at least in the early outburst
phases. Their visible progenitors are located close to the Main Sequence, away
from the post-AGB region. After the outburst, the remnants still closely
resemble the precursors (same brightness, same spectral type). Many more
similar objects could be buried among poorly studied novae that have been

in a natural way the fact that the superconductivity in $UGe_2$, $ZrZn_2$ and
$URhGe$ is confined to the ferromagnetic phase.The order parameter is a spin
anti-parallel component of a spin-1 triplet with zero spin projection. The
transverse spin fluctuations are pair forming and the longitudinal ones are
pair breaking. In the present paper, a superconducting solution, based on the
magnon exchange mechanism, is obtained which closely matches the experiments
with $ZrZn_2$ and $URhGe$. The onset of superconductivity leads to the
appearance of complicated Fermi surfaces in the spin up and spin down momentum
distribution functions. Each of them consist of two pieces, but they are
simple-connected and can be made very small by varying the microscopic
parameters. As a result, it is obtained that the specific heat depends on the
temperature linearly, at low temperature, and the coefficient $\gamma=\frac
{C}{T}$ is smaller in the superconducting phase than in the ferromagnetic one.
The absence of a quantum transition from ferromagnetism to ferromagnetic
superconductivity in a weak ferromagnets $ZrZn_2$ and $URhGe$ is explained
accounting for the contribution of magnon self-interaction to the spin
fluctuations' parameters. It is shown that in the presence of an external

When a parallel magnetic field is added in the plane of the wells, tunneling
between the wells acts as a spatially rotating effective Zeeman field coupled
to the ``pseudospins'' describing the well index of the electron states. For
small parallel fields, these pseudospins follow this rotation, but at larger
fields they do not, and a commensurate-incommensurate transition results.
Working in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we show that the combination of
stripes and commensuration in this system leads to a very rich phase diagram.
The parallel magnetic field is responsible for oscillations in the tunneling
matrix element that induce a complex sequence of transitions between
commensurate and incommensurate liquid or stripe states. The homogeneous and

between agent logics and agent programming frameworks. The main reason for this
problem of establishing a link between agent logics and agent programming
frameworks is identified and explained by the fact that agent programming
frameworks have not incorporated the concept of a `declarative goal'. Instead,
such frameworks have focused mainly on plans or `goals-to-do' instead of the
end goals to be realised which are also called `goals-to-be'. In this paper, a
new programming language called GOAL is introduced which incorporates such
declarative goals. The notion of a `commitment strategy' - one of the main
theoretical insights due to agent logics, which explains the relation between
beliefs and goals - is used to construct a computational semantics for GOAL.
Finally, a proof theory for proving properties of GOAL agents is introduced.
Thus, we offer a complete theory of agent programming in the sense that our
theory provides both for a programming framework and a programming logic for
such agents. An example program is proven correct by using this programming
logic.

of SU(3)^5 flavour symmetry breaking, the background values of fields
transforming under the flavour group as the ordinary Yukawa couplings. We
analyse present bounds on the effective scale of dimension-six operators, which
range between 1 and 10 TeV, with the most stringent constraints imposed by B ->
X_s gamma. In this class of theories, it is possible to relate predictions for
FCNC processes in B physics to those in K physics. We compare the sensitivity
of various experimental searches in probing the hypothesis of MFV. Within the
two-Higgs-doublet scenario, we develop a general procedure to obtain all
tan(beta)-enhanced Higgs-mediated FCNC amplitudes, discussing in particular
their impact in B -> l^+l^-, Delta M_B and B -> X_s gamma. As a byproduct, we
derive some two-loop tan(beta)-enhanced supersymmetric contributions to B ->

geometrically in string theory, as suspended brane constructions, D-branes
wrapping cycles in Calabi-Yau manifolds, orbifolds, and otherwise. Among the
applications of this idea are simple derivations and generalizations of Seiberg
duality for the theories which can be so realized.
  We abstract from these arguments the idea that Seiberg duality arises because
a configuration of gauge theory can be realized as a bound state of a
collection of branes in more than one way, and we show that different brane
world-volume theories obtained this way have matching moduli spaces, the
primary test of Seiberg duality.
  Furthermore, we do this by defining ``brane'' and all the other ingredients
of such arguments purely algebraically, for a very large class of N=1 quiver
supersymmetric gauge theories, making physical intuitions about brane-antibrane
systems and tachyon condensation precise using the tools of homological
algebra.
  These techniques allow us to compute the spectrum and superpotential of the
dual theory from first principles, and to make contact with geometry and
topological string theory when this is appropriate, but in general provide a
more abstract notion of ``noncommutative geometry'' which is better suited to
these problems. This makes contact with mathematical results in the
representation theory of algebras; in this language, Seiberg duality is a
tilting equivalence between the derived categories of the quiver algebras of
the dual theories.

investigated with an emphasis on the role of the non-linear radion in the brane
world. The equations of motion in the bulk is solved using a low energy
expansion method. This allows us, through the junction conditions, to deduce
the effective equations of motion for the gravity on the brane. It is shown
that the gravity on the brane world is described by a quasi-scalar-tensor
theory with a specific coupling function omega(Psi) = 3 Psi / 2(1-Psi) on the
positive tension brane and omega(Phi) = -3 Phi / 2(1+Phi) on the negative
tension brane, where Psi and Phi are non-linear realizations of the radion on
the positive and negative tension branes, respectively. In contrast to the
usual scalar-tensor gravity, the quasi-scalar-tensor gravity couples with two
kinds of matter, namely, the matters on both positive and negative tension
branes, with different effective gravitational coupling constants. In
particular, the radion disguised as the scalar fields Psi and Phi couples with
the sum of the traces of the energy momentum tensor on both branes. In the
course of the derivation, it has been revealed that the radion plays an
essential role to convert the non-local Einstein gravity with the generalized
dark radiation to the local quasi-scalar-tensor gravity. For completeness, we
also derive the effective action for our theory by substituting the bulk
solution into the original action. It is also shown that the
quasi-scalar-tensor gravity works as holograms at the low energy in the sense
that the bulk geometry can be reconstructed from the solution of the
quasi-scalar-tensor gravity.

on the vertices of D with an arc from a to b in D^k iff one can get from a to b
in D with exactly k steps. This notion is equivalent to the k-fold composition
of binary relations or k-th powers of Boolean matrices.
  A k-th root of a directed graph D is another directed graph R with R^k = D.
We show that for each k >= 2, computing a k-th root of a directed graph is at

Algebraic Geometry in homotopical and higher categorical contexts (for part II,

topos. For this, we use S-categories (i.e. simplicially enriched categories) as
models for certain kind of \infty-categories, and we develop the notions of
S-topologies, S-sites and stacks over them. We prove in particular, that for an
S-category T endowed with an S-topology, there exists a model category of
stacks over T, generalizing the model category structure on simplicial
presheaves over a Grothendieck site of A. Joyal and R. Jardine. We also prove
some analogs of the relations between topologies and localizing subcategories
of the categories of presheaves, by proving that there exists a one-to-one
correspondence between S-topologies on an S-category T, and certain left exact
Bousfield localizations of the model category of pre-stacks on T. Based on the
above results, we study the notion of model topos introduced by C. Rezk, and we
relate it to our model categories of stacks over S-sites. In the second part of

Curved thin domains and parabolic equations, Stud. Math. 151), the above family
has a limit equation, which is an abstract semilinear parabolic equation
defined on a certain abstract limit phase space. One of the objectives of this
paper is to give more manageable characterizations of the limit phase space.
Under additional hypotheses, we also give a simple description of the limit
equation. If, in addition, $M$ is a sphere and the nonlinearity of the above
equations is dissipative, we prove that, if the thickness is small enough, the
corresponding equation possesses an inertial manifold, i.e. an invariant
manifold containing the attractor of the equation. We thus obtain the existence
of inertial manifolds for reaction-diffusion equations on certain classes of
thin domains of genuinely high dimension.

models to low momenta results in a unique nucleon interaction V_{low k}. This
interaction is free of short-ranged singularities and can be used directly in
many-body calculations. The RG scaling properties follow directly from the
invariance of the scattering phase shifts. We discuss the RG treatment of Fermi
liquids. The RG equation for the scattering amplitude in the two particle-hole
channels is given at zero temperature. The flow equations are simplified by
retaining only the leading term in an expansion in small momentum transfers.
The RG flow is illustrated by first studying a system of spin-polarized
fermions in a simple model. Finally, results for neutron matter are presented
by employing the unique low momentum interaction V_{low k} as initial condition
of the flow. The RG approach yields the amplitude for non-forward scattering,
which is of great interest for calculations of transport properties and
superfluid gaps in neutron star interiors. The methods used can also be applied
to condensed matter systems in the absence of long-ranged interactions.

SU(2) algebra with both a fermionic and a bosonic oscillator. We show that the
total spin states obtained are: one boson singlet state and an arbitrary number
of spin-1/2 states, the later ones are energy degenerate. It means that we have
in this case supersymmetric quantum mechanics and also the addition of angular
momentum for massless particles. We review too the cases of two bosonic and
fermionic oscillators.

Nature doesn't favor nonlocality for massive particles in the

S', the entangled Bell state shared by Alice and Bob appears as the
superposition of the Bell bases in the frame S' due to the requirement of the
special relativity. It is shown that the entangled pair satisfies the Bell's
inequality when the boost speed approaches the speed of light, thus providing a
counter example for nonlocality of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen(EPR) paradox.

intrinsically due to its geometric property, are getting considerable attention
in quantum computing theoretically. So far, only one experiment about adiabatic
geometric gate with NMR through Berry phase has been reported. However, there
are two drawbacks in it. First, the adiabatic condition of Berry phase makes
such gate very slowly. Second, the extra operation to eliminate the dynamic
phase. As we know, geometric phase can exist both adiabatic(Berry phase) and
nonadiabatic(Aharonov-Anandan phase). In this letter, we reports the first
experimental realization of nonadiabatic geometric gate with NMR through
conditional-AA phase. In our experiment the gates can be made faster and more
easily, and the two drawbacks mentioned above are removed.
