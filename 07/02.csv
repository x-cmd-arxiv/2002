and properties of the rotation curves are considered as a function of the
isolation degree, morphological type and luminosity. The line ratios are used
to estimate the metallicity of all the detected HII regions, thus producing a
composite metallicity profile for different types of spirals. We have found
that isolated galaxies tend to be of later types and lower luminosity than the
interacting galaxies. The outer parts of the rotation curves of isolated
galaxies tend to be flatter than in interacting galaxies, but they show similar
relations between global parameters. The scatter of the Tully-Fisher relation
defined by isolated galaxies is significantly lower than that of interacting
galaxies. The [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratios, used as metallicity indicator, show a
clear trend between Z and morphological type, t, with earlier spirals showing
larger ratios; this trend is tighter when instead of t the gradient of the
inner rotation curve, G, is used; no trend is found with the interaction
status. The Z-gradient of the disks depends on the type, being almost flat for
early spirals, and increasing for later types. The [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratios
measured for disk HII regions of interacting galaxies are higher than for
normal/isolated objects, even if all the galaxy families present similar
distributions of H$\alpha$ Equivalent Width.

Agile-Boltztran, solves the Boltzmann transport equation for the angular and
spectral neutrino distribution functions in self-consistent simulations of
stellar core collapse and postbounce evolution. It implements a dynamically
adaptive grid in comoving coordinates. Most macroscopically interesting
physical quantities are defined by expectation values of the distribution
function. We optimize the finite differencing of the microscopic transport
equation for a consistent evolution of important expectation values. We test
our code in simulations launched from progenitor stars with 13 solar masses and
40 solar masses. ~0.5 s after core collapse and bounce, the protoneutron star
in the latter case reaches its maximum mass and collapses further to form a
black hole. When the hydrostatic gravitational contraction sets in, we find a
transient increase in electron flavor neutrino luminosities due to a change in
the accretion rate. The muon- and tauon-neutrino luminosities and rms energies,
however, continue to rise because previously shock-heated material with a
non-degenerate electron gas starts to replace the cool degenerate material at
their production site. We demonstrate this by supplementing the concept of
neutrinospheres with a more detailed statistical description of the origin of
escaping neutrinos. We compare the evolution of the 13 solar mass progenitor
star to simulations with the MGFLD approximation, based on a recently developed
flux limiter. We find similar results in the postbounce phase and validate this
MGFLD approach for the spherically symmetric case with standard input physics.

Approximately 30 H-alpha-emitting knots were identified in a region
approximately 150 kpc across, in the vicinity of the spiral galaxies NGC 3860,
CGCG 97-125 and CGCG 97-114. Follow-up imaging and spectroscopy reveals that
some of the knots are associated with previously uncataloged dwarf galaxies
(M_B = -15.8 to -16.5), while others appear to be isolated HII galaxies or
intergalactic HII regions. Radial velocities obtained for several of the knots
show that they are physically associated with a small group or subcluster
including CGCG 97-114 and CGCG 97-125. No comparable concentration of
emission-line objects has been found elsewhere in any of the eight northern
Abell clusters surveyed to date. The strong H-alpha emission in the objects and
their high spatial density argue against this being a group of normal,
unperturbed dwarf galaxies. Emission-line spectra of several of the knots also
show some to be anomalously metal-rich relative to their luminosities. The
results suggest that many of these objects were formed or triggered by tidal
interactions or mergers involving CGCG 97-125 and other members of the group. A
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope HI map of the region shows direct evidence
for tidal interactions in the group. These objects may be related to the tidal
dwarf galaxies found in some interacting galaxy pairs, merger remnants, and
compact groups. They could also represent evolutionary precursors to the class
of isolated ultracompact dwarf galaxies that have been identified in the Fornax
cluster.

play an important role in solving the angular momentum catastrophe claimed from
previous simulations of galaxy formation within the hierarchical framework. The
stellar material in the disk component has a final specific angular momentum
equal to 40% and 90% of that of the dark halo in the LambdaCDM and LambdaWDM
models respectively. The LambdaWDM galaxy has a drastically reduced satellite
population and a negligible stellar spheroidal component. Encounters with
satellites play only a minor role in disturbing the disk. Satellites possess a
variety of star formation histories linked to mergers and pericentric passages
along their orbit around the primary galaxy. In both cosmologies, the galactic
halo retains most of the baryons accreted and builds up a hot gas phase with a
substantial X-ray emission. Therefore, while we have been successful in
creating a realistic stellar disk in a massive galaxy within the LambdaCDM
scenario, energy injection emerges as necessary ingredient to reduce the baryon
fraction in galactic halos, independent of the cosmology adopted. (abridged)

($E_{pk}$) decays through the four BATSE channels, the photon flux peak in each
individual channel will inevitably be offset producing what we measure as lag.
We test this hypothesis by measuring the rate of $E_{pk}$ decay ($\Phi_{o}$)
for a sample of clean single peaked bursts with measured lag. We find a direct
correlation between the decay timescale and the spectral lag, demonstrating the
relationship between time delay of the low energy photons and the decay of
$E_{pk}$. This implies that the luminosity of a GRB is directly related to the
burst's rate of spectral evolution, which we believe begins to reveal the
underlying physics behind the lag-luminosity correlation. We discuss several
possible mechanisms that could cause the observed evolution and its connection
to the luminosity of the burst.

in their rotation curves as well as in their morphology, such as M101 and NGC
628. We show that both these features can be explained by the response of a
galactic disk to an imposed lopsided halo potential. A perturbation potential
of 5 % is deduced for the morphologically lopsided galaxies in the Rix &
Zaritsky (1995) sample. This is shown to result in a difference of 10 % or
about 20-30 kms^{-1} in the rotation velocity on the two sides of the major
axis. Interestingly, the observed isophotal asymmetry in a typical spiral
galaxy is not much smaller and it results in a velocity asymmetry of 7 % or
about 14-21 kms^{-1} . Hence, we predict that most galaxies show a fairly
significant rotational asymmetry. The rotation velocity is shown to be maximum
along the elongated isophote - in agreement with the observations along the SW
in M101, while it is minimum along the opposite direction. This result leads to
the distinctive asymmetric shape of the rotation curve which rises more steeply
in one half of the galaxy than the other, as observed by Swaters et al. (1999).
This shape is shown to be a robust feature and would result for any centrally
concentrated disk. The net disk lopsidedness and hence the asymmetry in the
rotation curve is predicted to increase with radius and hence can be best
studied using HI gas as the tracer.

involved in this work. So far only the scientific critique to this work was due
to Tereno (astro-ph/9905144, astro-ph/9905298) and which was answered in Mitra
(astro-ph/9905175, astro-ph/9905175, astro-ph/9905329). Now Tereno
(gr-qc/0111073) has also admitted that the local 3-speed of a free particle as
conventionally defined by all previous authors and as measured in any
coordinate system, is indeed c at the EH. Further since the acceleration SCALAR
BLOWS UP at the EH, our result that there cannot be any EH at a finite R is
reconfirmed. We explicitly show here that the final state of spherical collapse
of very massive stars corresponds to a zero mass BH with 2M/R ->0. But at any
finite epoch there would be a Eternally Collapsing Objects (ECO) of finite
mass. However, if quantum back reaction in the strong gravity regime would
cause a phase transition p ~ rho, there could be static ultracompact objects
(UCO) of ~ 10 M (solar). Further, if the phase transition goes proceeds to p=
-rho, there could be UCOs of arbitrary high mass (Mazur & Mottola,
astro-ph/0109035). Both ECOs and UCOs are expected to possess strong internal
magnetic field whereas the the same for a BH is zero. Robertson & Leiter (ApJ
565, 447, 2002, astro-ph/0102381) have shown that the BH candiadates may indeed
possess such strong intrinsic mag field. Thus the BHCs are likely to ECOs/UCOs

General Catalogue of Variable Stars (P=0.361732 days). However, contrary to
what was previously found, the amplitude and shape of the light curve qualify
CM Leo as a very regular first overtone pulsator with a prominent hump on the
rising branch of its multicolour light curves. According to an abundace
analysis performed on three spectra taken near minimum light (0.42 < phase <
0.61), CM Leo is a metal-poor star with metal abundance [Fe/H]=-1.93 +/- 0.20.
The photometric and radial velocity curves of CM Leo have been compared with
the predictions of suitable pulsational models to infer tight constraints on
the stellar mass, effective temperature, and distance modulus of the star. We
derive a true distance modulus of CM Leo of (m-M)0=13.11 +/- 0.02 mag and a

once corrected for evolutionary and metallicity effects, leads to a true

insights into the cluster merger. The intracluster medium has a
non-monotonically decreasing radial abundance profile. We argue that the most
plausible origin for the abundance enhancement is unmixed, high abundance
subcluster gas from the merger. The enrichment consists of two stages:
off-center deposition of a higher abundance material during a subcluster merger
followed by a strong, localized intracluster wind that acts to drive out the
light elements, producing the observed abundance enhancement. The wind is
needed to account for both an increase in the heavy element abundance and the
lack of an enhancement in the gas density. Dynamical evidence for the wind
includes: (1) a large scale, low surface brightness feature perpendicular to
the merger axis that appears to be an asymmetric pattern of gas flow to the
northwest, away from the center of the main cluster, (2) compressed gas in the
opposite direction (toward the cluster center), and (3), the hottest regions
visible in the temperature map coincide with the proposed merger geometry and
the resultant gas flow. The Chandra data for the central region of the main
cluster shows a slightly cooler, filamentary region that is centered on the
central cD galaxy and is aligned with the merger axis directly linking the
dynamical state of the cD to the merger. Overall, the high spectral/spatial
resolution Chandra observations support our earlier hypothesis (Henriksen,
Donnelly, & Davis 1999) that we are viewing a minor merger in the plane of the
sky.

leptonic versus hadronic -- is still under debate. We investigate the
microphysical details of the conversion process of the kinetic energy in
collimated relativistic pair outflows into radiation through interactions with
the ambient interstellar medium. Viewed from the coordinate system comoving
with the pair outflow, the interstellar protons and electrons represent a
proton-electron beam propagating with relativistic speed in the pair plasma. We
demonstrate that the beam excites both electrostatic and low-frequency
magnetohydrodynamic Alfven-type waves via a two-stream instability in the pair
background plasma, and we calculate the time evolution of the distribution
functions of the beam particles and the generated plasma wave turbulence power
spectra. For standard AGN jet outflow and environment parameters we show that
the initial beam distributions of interstellar protons and electrons quickly
relax to plateau-distributions in parallel momentum, transferring thereby
one-half of the initial energy density of the beam particles to electric field
fluctuations of the generated electrostatic turbulence. On considerably longer
time scales, the plateaued interstellar electrons and protons will isotropise
by their self-generated transverse turbulence and thus be picked-up in the
outflow pair plasma. These longer time scales are also characteristic for the
development of transverse hydromagnetic turbulence from the plateaued electrons
and protons. This hydromagnetic turbulence upstream and downstream is crucial
for diffusive shock acceleration to operate at external or internal shocks
associated with pair outflows.

to these trions. Although similar to the exciton ladder diagrams, with the hole
replaced by an exciton, they are actually much more tricky : (i) Due to the
composite nature of the exciton, one cannot identify an exciton-electron
potential similar to the Coulomb potential between electron and hole ; (ii) the
spins are unimportant for excitons while they are crucial for trions, singlet
and triplet states having different energies.

Van Hove singularity. In this situation, there are six competing instabilities:
$s$- and d-wave superconductivity, spin-and charge-density waves and two phases
with circulating charge and spin currents, respectively. The required
renormalization group formalism is presented on a most elementary level,
connecting the idea of the ``parquet summation'' to the more modern concept of
Wilson's effective action. As a result, a rich phase diagram is obtained as a
function of the model interaction. This phase diagram is exact in the weak
coupling limit, since the transition line between two neighboring phases is
then fixed by symmetries. The physical picture of each instability is completed
by studying the low temperature behavior of the spin susceptibility and the
charge compressibility. We also observe a general trend towards a Fermi surface
distortion, but the nesting is not destroyed.

cold alkali atoms has renewed attention on the theoretical properties of the
impenetrable Bose gas. Of primary concern is the ground state occupation of
effective single particle states in the finite system, and thus the tendency
for Bose-Einstein condensation. This requires the computation of the density
matrix. For the impenetrable Bose gas on a circle we evaluate the density
matrix in terms of a particular Painlev\'e VI transcendent in $\sigma$-form,
and furthermore show that the density matrix satisfies a recurrence relation in
the number of particles. For the impenetrable Bose gas in a harmonic trap, and
with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, we give a determinant form for
the density matrix, a form as an average over the eigenvalues of an ensemble of

the velocity field itself) in well-developed turbulence are also dominated by
the Statistically Preserved Structures of auxiliary passive fields which are
advected by the same velocity field. The Statistically Preserved Structures are
eigenmodes of eigenvalue 1 of an appropriate propagator of the decaying
(unforced) passive field, or equivalently, the zero modes of a related
operator. In this paper we investigate further this surprising finding via two
examples, one akin to turbulent convection in which the temperature is the
active scalar, and the other akin to magneto-hydrodynamics in which the
magnetic field is the active vector. In the first example, all the even
correlation functions of the active and passive fields exhibit identical
scaling behavior. The second example appears at first sight to be a
counter-example: the statistical objects of the active and passive fields have
entirely different scaling exponents. We demonstrate nevertheless that the
Statistically Preserved Structures of the passive vector dominate again the
statistics of the active field, except that due to a dynamical conservation law
the amplitude of the leading zero mode cancels exactly. The active vector is
then dominated by the sub-leading zero mode of the passive vector. Our work
thus suggests that the statistical properties of active fields in turbulence
can be understood with the same generality as those of passive fields.

to quantum theory is developed on the basis of earlier work by Hartle, and used

collapse, Bohm's formulation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen, and Hardy's paradox.
It is argued that wave function collapse is not needed for introducing
probabilities into relativistic quantum mechanics, and in any case should never
be thought of as a physical process. Alternative approaches to stochastic time
dependence can be used to construct a physical picture of the measurement
process that is less misleading than collapse models. In particular, one can
employ a coarse-grained but fully quantum mechanical description in which
particles move along trajectories, with behavior under Lorentz transformations
the same as in classical relativistic physics, and detectors are triggered by
particles reaching them along such trajectories. States entangled between
spacelike separate regions are also legitimate quantum descriptions, and can be
consistently handled by the formalism presented here. The paradoxes in question
arise because of using modes of reasoning which, while correct for classical
physics, are inconsistent with the mathematical structure of quantum theory,
and are resolved (or tamed) by using a proper quantum analysis. In particular,
there is no need to invoke, nor any evidence for, mysterious long-range
superluminal influences, and thus no incompatibility, at least from this
source, between relativity theory and quantum mechanics.
