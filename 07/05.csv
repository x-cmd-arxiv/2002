Survey of Spiral and Irregular Galaxies). We present HI maps, optical images,
and radial HI density profiles. We have also derived the rotation curves and
studied the warping and lopsidedness of the HI disks.
  20 out of the 26 galaxies of our sample are warped, confirming that warping
of the HI disks is a very common phenomenon in disk galaxies. Indeed, we find
that all galaxies that have an extended HI disk with respect to the optical are
warped.
  The warping usually starts around the edge of the optical disk. The degree of
warping varies considerably from galaxy to galaxy. Furthermore, many warps are
asymmetric, as they show up in only one side of the disk or exhibit large
differences in amplitude in the approaching and receding sides of the galaxy.
These asymmetries are more pronounced in rich environments, which may indicate
that tidal interactions are a source of warp asymmetry. A rich environment
tends to produce larger warps as well. The presence of lopsidedness seems to be
related to the presence of nearby companions.

color-magnitude diagram of Galactic globular clusters, and the fine-tuning of
theoretical models, made possible by the recent observational efforts to build
homogeneous photometric databases. In particular, we examine here the
calibration of the morphological parameter W(HB) vs. metallicity, originally
proposed by Brocato et al. (1998), which essentially measures the color
position of the red-giant branch. We show that the parameter can be used to
have a first-order estimate of the cluster metallicity, since the dispersion
around the mean trend with [Fe/H] is compatible with the measurement errors.
The tight W(HB)-[Fe/H] relation is then used to show that variations in helium
content or age do not affect the parameter, whereas it is strongly influenced
by the mixing-length parameter alpha (as expected). This fact allows us, for
the first time, to state that there is no trend of alpha with the metal content
of a cluster. A thorough examination of the interrelated questions of the
alpha-elements enhancement and the color-T(eff) transformations, highlights
that there is an urgent need for an independent assessment of which of the two
presently accepted metallicity scales is the true indicator of a cluster's iron
content. Whatever scenario is adopted, it also appears that a deep revision of
the (V-I)-temperature relations is needed.

North and Canada-France-Hawaii telescopes are used to investigate the bright
stellar content and central regions of the nearby elliptical galaxy Maffei 1.
Stars evolving on the upper asymptotic giant branch (AGB) are resolved in a
field 3 arcmin from the center of the galaxy. The locus of bright giants on the
(K, H-K) color-magnitude diagram is consistent with a population of stars like
those in Baade's Window reddened by E(H-K) = 0.28 +/- 0.05 mag. This
corresponds to A_V = 4.5 +/- 0.8 mag, and is consistent with previous estimates
of the line of sight extinction computed from the integrated properties of
Maffei 1. The AGB-tip occurs at K = 20.0, which correponds to M_K = -8.7;
hence, the AGB-tip brightness in Maffei 1 is comparable to that in M32, NGC
5128, and the bulges of M31 and the Milky-Way. The near-infrared luminosity
functions (LFs) of bright AGB stars in Maffei 1, M32, and NGC 5128 are also in
excellent agreement, both in terms of overall shape and the relative density of
infrared-bright stars with respect to the fainter stars that dominate the light
at visible and red wavelengths. It is concluded that the brightest AGB stars in
Maffei 1, NGC 5128, M32, and the bulge of M31 trace an old, metal-rich
population, rather than an intermediate age population. It is also demonstrated
that Maffei 1 contains a distinct red nucleus, and this is likely the optical
signature of low-level nuclear activity and/or a distinct central stellar
population. Finally, there is an absence of globular clusters brighter than the
peak of the globular cluster LF in the central 700 x 700 parsecs of Maffei 1.

letter by three of the authors, with emphasis on the signature due to
monochromatic gamma-ray yields: the combined effect of cosmological redshift
and absorption along the line of sight produces sharp bumps, peaked at the rest
frame energy of the lines and asymmetrically smeared to lower energies. The
level of the flux depends both on the particle physics scenario for WIMP dark

introduced by the latter are thoroughly discussed implementing a realistic
model inspired by results of the state-of-the-art N-body simulations and
semi-analytic modeling in the cold dark matter structure formation theory. We
also address the question of the potential gamma-ray background originating

parameter space defined by the particle physics setup and the structure
formation scenario, for which the WIMP induced extragalactic gamma-ray signal
will be detectable in the new generation of gamma-ray telescopes such as GLAST.

the model gives a good description of the observed radial profiles of electron
density and temperature, provided we take the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ to
be about 30% of the Spitzer conductivity. Since the required $\kappa$ is
consistent with the recent theoretical estimate of Narayan & Medvedev (2001)
for a turbulent magnetized plasma, we consider a conduction-based equilibrium
model to be viable for these clusters. We further show that the hot gas is
thermally stable because of the presence of conduction. For five other
clusters, A2052, A2597, Hydra A, Ser 159-03 and 3C295, the model requires
unphysically large values of $\kappa$ to fit the data. These clusters must have
some additional source of heat, most likely an active galactic nucleus since
all the clusters have strong radio galaxies at their centers. We suggest that
thermal conduction, though not dominant in these clusters, may nevertheless
play a significant role by preventing the gas from becoming thermally unstable.

CP
stars are a slowly rotating subgroup of these stars. It is possible that they
possessed long-lived accretion disks in their T Tauri phase. Magnetic coupling
of disk and star leads to rotational braking at the surface of the star.
Microscopic viscosities are extremely small and will not be able to reduce the
rotation rate of the core of the star. We investigate the question whether
magneto-rotational instability can provide turbulent angular momentum
transport. We illuminate the question whether or not differential rotation is
present in CP stars. Numerical MHD simulations of thick stellar shells are
performed. An initial differential rotation law is subject to the influence of
a magnetic field. The configuration gives indeed rise to magneto-rotational
instability. The emerging flows and magnetic fields transport efficiently
angular momentum outwards. Weak dependence on the magnetic Prandtl number
(~0.01 in stars) is found from the simulations. Since the estimated time-scale
of decay of differential rotation is 10^7-10^8 yr and comparable to the
life-time of A stars, we find the braking of the core to be an ongoing process
in many CP stars. The evolution of the surface rotation of CP stars with age
will be an observational challenge and of much value for verifying the
simulations.

case studies. Along the way a lot of new knowledge has been picked up as to the

bright points, which possibly are generated by a small-scale dynamo operating

of twisted flux ropes and loops, interacting with rotation and convection.
Ultimately the magnetic surface signatures of these simulations, when compared

to select two samples with one preferentially on the near side and the other on
the far side. In the first method, we divide red clump giants into a bright
sample and a faint one; stars in the bright sample will be on average more on
the near side and vice versa. The second method relies on the fact that lensed
bulge stars lie preferentially on the far side due to the enhanced lensing
probability by the stars on the near side and in the disk. If the radial
streaming motion is ~50km/s, we find the difference in the average radial
velocity between the bright and faint samples can reach ~33km/s while the
corresponding difference is about ~10km/s between the lensed stars and all
observed stars. The difference in the average proper motion between the bright

the Zel'dovich theory. This model is generally consistent with simulations of
absorbers formation, accurately describes the Large Scale Structure observed in
the galaxy distribution at small redshifts and emphasizes the generic
similarity of the LSS and absorbers.
  The simple physical model of absorbers asserts that they are composed of DM
and gaseous matter and it allows us to estimate the column density and
overdensity of DM and gaseous components and the entropy of the gas trapped
within the DM potential wells. The parameters of DM component are found to be
consistent with theoretical expectations for the Gaussian initial perturbations
with the WDM--like power spectrum. We demonstrate the influence of the main
physical factors responsible for the absorbers evolution.
  The analysis of redshift distribution of absorbers confirms the self
consistence of the assumed physical model and allows to estimate the shape of
the initial power spectrum at small scales what in turn restricts the mass of
dominant fraction of DM particles to $M_{DM}\approx 0.6 - 2$ keV. Our results
verify the redshift variations of intensity of the UV background by about $4 -
6$ times and indicate that, perhaps, the available observations underestimate
the intensity of this background.

to the cosmological tests based on, e.g., the magnitude-redshift relation of
Type Ia supernovae, especially with regards to the Hubble parameter that could
be measured with a statistical uncertainty at the one percent level. Assuming a
flat universe, the statistical uncertainty on the mass density is found to be
sigma^stat_m <0.05. However, systematic effects from the uncertainty of the
lens modeling are likely to dominate. E.g., if the lensing galaxies are
extremely compact but are (erroneously) modeled as singular isothermal spheres,

The analysis of the original and surrogate data sets with measures, which are
sensitive to nonlinearities, yields information about the existence of
nonlinear correlations in the data. We demonstrate how to generate surrogate
data sets from a given point distribution, which have the same linear
properties (power spectrum) as well as the same density amplitude distribution.
We propose weighted scaling indices as a nonlinear statistical measure to
quantify local morphological elements in large scale structure. Using
surrogates is is shown that the data sets with the same 2-point correlation
functions have slightly different void probability functions and especially a
different set of weighted scaling indices. Thus a refined analysis of the large
scale structure becomes possible by calculating local scaling properties
whereby the method of constrained randomisation yields a vital tool for testing
the performance of statistical measures in terms of sensitivity to different
topological features and discriminative power.

might obtain the semiclassical limit of ordinary matter quantum fields (QFT)
propagating on curved spacetimes (CST) from full fledged Quantum General
Relativity (QGR), starting from first principles. We stress that we do not
claim to have a satisfactory answer to this question, rather our intention is
to ignite a discussion by displaying the problems that have to be solved when
carrying out such a program. In the present paper we propose a scheme that one
might follow in order to arrive at such a limit. We discuss the technical and
conceptual problems that arise in doing so and how they can be solved in
principle. As to be expected, completely new issues arise due to the fact that
QGR is a background independent theory. For instance, fundamentally the notion
of a photon involves not only the Maxwell quantum field but also the metric
operator - in a sense, there is no photon vacuum state but a ""photon vacuum
operator""! While in this first paper we focus on conceptual and abstract
aspects, for instance the definition of (fundamental) n-particle states (e.g.
photons), in the second paper we perform detailed calculations including, among
other things, coherent state expectation values and propagation on random
lattices. These calculations serve as an illustration of how far one can get
with present mathematical techniques. Although they result in detailed
predictions for the size of first quantum corrections such as the gamma-ray
burst effect, these predictions should not be taken too seriously because a)
the calculations are carried out at the kinematical level only and b) while we
can classify the amount of freedom in our constructions, the analysis of the
physical significance of possible choices has just begun.

tries to derive the Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on Curved Spacetimes (CST) limit
from background independent Quantum General Relativity (QGR). The constructions
of [1] make heavy use of the notion of semiclassical states for QGR. In the
present paper, we employ the complexifier coherent states for QGR recently
proposed by Thiemann and Winkler as semiclassical states, and thus fill the
general formulas obtained in [1] with life. We demonstrate how one can, under
some simplifying assumptions, explicitely compute expectation values of the
operators relevant for the gravity-matter Hamiltonians of [1] in the
complexifier coherent states. These expectation values give rise to effective
matter Hamiltonians on the background on which the gravitational coherent state
is peaked and thus induce approximate notions of n-particle states and matter
propagation on fluctuating spacetimes. We display the details for the scalar
and the electromagnetic field. The effective theories exhibit two types of
corrections as compared to the the ordinary QFT on CST. The first is due to the
quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field, the second arises from the
fact that background independence forces both geometry and matter to propagate
on a spacetime that is the product of the real line and a (random) graph.
Finally we obtain explicit numerical predictions for non-standard dispersion
relations for the scalar and the electromagnetic field. They should, however,
not be taken too seriously, due to the many ambiguities in our scheme, the
analysis of the physical significance of which has only begun. We show however,
that one can classify these ambiguities at least in broad terms.

explicitly respects chiral symmetry through the enforcement of the chiral Ward
identities. The pion dispersion relation is computed through the computation of
the pion self-energy in a non-perturbative fashion by giving an approximate
solution to the Schwinger-Dyson equation for this self-energy. The dispersion
relation is described in terms of a density and temperature dependent mass and
an index of refraction which is also temperature, density as well as momentum
dependent. The index of refraction is larger than unity for all values of the
momentum for finite $\mu$ and $T$. We conclude by exploring some of the

Phys. {\bf B107}, 365 (1976)] the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in such
an external field will not be an ordinary function but, instead, {\it section}.
Because of the peculiar radial symmetry of the global monopole spacetime, it is
possible to cover its space section by two overlapping regions, needed to
define the singularity free vector potential, and to study the quantum effects
due to a charged scalar field in this system. In order to develop this analysis
we construct the explicit Euclidean scalar Green {\it section} associated with
a charged massless field in a global monopole spacetime in the presence of the
Abelian Wu-Yang magnetic monopole. Having this Green section it is possible to
study the vacuum polarization effects. We explicitly calculate the renormalized
vacuum expectation value $<\Phi(x)^*\Phi(x) >_{Ren.}$, associated with a
charged scalar field operator and the respective energy-momentum tensor,
  $<T_{\mu\nu}(x)>_{Ren.}$, which are expressed in terms of the parameter which
codify the presence of the global and magnetic monopoles.

irreducible representations of the SO(3) symmetry group (with different
""angular momenta"" $\ell$). For different values of $\ell$ the second order
correlation function is characterized by different scaling exponents
$\zeta_2(\ell)$. In this paper we compute these scaling exponents in a Direct
Interaction Approximation (DIA). By linearizing the DIA equations in small
anisotropy we set up a linear operator and find its zero-modes in the inertial
interval of scales. Thus the scaling exponents in each $\ell$-sector follow
from solvability condition, and are not determined by dimensional analysis. The
main result of our calculation is that the scaling exponents $\zeta_2(\ell)$
form a strictly increasing spectrum at least until $\ell=6$, guaranteeing that
the effects of anisotropy decay as power laws when the scale of observation
diminishes. The results of our calculations are compared to available
experiments and simulations.

the missing mass spectra of the d p $\to$ p p X reaction although with a weaker
signature. Many checks were performed to make sure that these structures were
not produced by experimental artifacts. Several narrow small amplitude peaks,
were also extracted using already published photo-nucleon cross sections. The
small widths of all these results, and the stability of the observed
structures, regardless of the experiment, were used to conclude that they are
genuine baryons which and not merely the consequence of dynamical
rescatterings. These baryons cannot be associated with classical $q^{3}$ quark
configurations. We associate them with two colored cluster quark
configurations.

model type many-body states short ranged two-body correlations caused by the
strong repulsive core and the pronounced tensor part of the nucleon-nucleon

this unitary correlator to the realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction.
  The momentum space representation shows that realistic interactions which
differ in their short range behaviour are mapped on the same correlated
Hamiltonian, indicating a successful provision for the correlations at high
momenta. Calculations for He4 using the one- and two-body part of the
correlated Hamiltonian compare favorably with exact many-body methods. For
heavier nuclei like O16 and Ca40 where exact many-body calculations are not
possible we compare our results with other approximations. The correlated
single-particle momentum distributions describe the occupation of states above
the Fermi momentum. The Unitary Correlation Operator Method (UCOM) can be used
in mean-field and shell model configuration spaces that are not able to
describe these repulsive and tensor correlations explicitly.

In contradistinction to the theoretical studies of quantum walks over

lattice states (specifically, coherent states on a circle) to demonstrate that
the key features of a quantum walk are observable albeit for strict parameter
ranges. A quantum quincunx may be realized with current cavity quantum
electrodynamics capabilities, and precise control over decoherence in such
experiments allows a remarkable decrease in the position noise, or spread, with
increasing decoherence.

bipartite mixed states by local operations and classical communication (LOCC).
We analyse the relations between the rates for different transitions and obtain
simple lower and upper bound for these transitions. In a transition from one
mixed state to another and back, the amount of irreversibility can be different
for different target states. Thus in a natural way, we get the concept of
""amount"" of irreversibility in asymptotic manipulations of entanglement. We
investigate the behaviour of these transformation rates for different target
states. We show that with respect to asymptotic transition rates under LOCC,
the maximally entangled states do not have a special status. In the process, we
obtain that the entanglement of formation is additive for all maximally
correlated states. This allows us to show irreversibility in asymptotic
entanglement manipulations for maximally correlated states in 2x2. We show that
the possible nonequality of distillable entanglement under LOCC and that under
operations preserving the positivity of partial transposition, is related to
the behaviour of the transitions (under LOCC) to separable target states.
