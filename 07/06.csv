gas is of current interest. We calculate the density matrix of that state in
two ways. The most effective method, in terms of yielding a simple, explicit
answer, is to construct a generating function within the traditional framework
of quantum statistical mechanics. The alternative method, arguably more
interesting, is to construct the thermal state as a vector state in an
artificial system with twice as many degrees of freedom. It is well known that
this construction has an actual physical realization in the quantum
thermodynamics of black holes, where the added degrees of freedom correspond to
the second sheet of the Kruskal manifold and the thermal vector state is a
state of the Unruh or the Hartle-Hawking type. What is unusual about the
present work is that the Bogolubov transformation used to construct the thermal
state combines in a rather symmetrical way with Bogolubov's original
transformation of the same form, used to implement the interaction of the
nonideal gas in linear approximation. In addition to providing a density
matrix, the method makes it possible to calculate efficiently certain
expectation values directly in terms of the thermal vector state of the doubled
system.

  limit of a quantum cosmology","4 pages, submitted to Astronomische Nachrichten",,,,"gr-qc",,"  If the gravitational field is quantized, then a solution of Einstein's field
equations is a valid cosmological model only if it corresponds to a classical
limit of a quantum cosmology. To determine which solutions are valid requires
looking at quantum cosmology in a particular way. Because we infer the geometry
by measurements on matter, we can represent the amplitude for any measurement
in terms of the amplitude for the matter fields, allowing us to integrate out
the gravitational degrees of freedom. Combining that result with a
path-integral representation for quantum cosmology leads to an integration over
4-geometries. Even when a semiclassical approximation for the propagator is
valid, the amplitude for any measurement includes an integral over the
gravitational degrees of freedom. The conditions for a solution of the field
equations to be a classical limit of a quantum cosmology are: (1) The effect of
the classical action dominates the integration, (2) the action is stationary
with respect to variation of the gravitational degrees of freedom, and (3) only
one saddlepoint contributes significantly to each integration.

unification. A more unified gauge symmetry, and the possibility of Higgs
doublets being components of the higher dimensional gauge multiplet, are
therefore compatible with a large energy interval where physics is described by
SU(5) gauge symmetry in 5D. This leads to the distinctive branching ratios for
proton decay from SU(5) gauge boson exchange, p -> l^+ pi^0, l^+ K^0, \bar{nu}

in bounded 2D domains. The velocity fields responsible for advection are smooth
(i.e., they have bounded gradients) and of a single large scale. Moreover, the
scale of the velocity field is taken to be similar to the size of the entire
domain. The importance of the initial scale of variation of the scalar field
with respect to that of the velocity field is strongly emphasized. If these
scales are comparable and the velocity field is time periodic, we see the
formation of a periodic scalar eigenmode. The eigenmode is numerically realized
by means of a deterministic 2D map on a lattice. Analytical justification for
the eigenmode is available from theorems in the dynamo literature. Weakening
the notion of an eigenmode to mean statistical stationarity, we provide
numerical evidence that the eigenmode solution also holds for aperiodic flows
(represented by random maps). Turning to the evolution of an initially small
scale scalar field, we demonstrate the transition from an evolving (i.e., {\it
non} self similar) pdf to a stationary (self similar) pdf as the scale of
variation of the scalar field progresses from being small to being comparable
to that of the velocity field (and of the domain). Furthermore, the {\it non}
self similar regime itself consists of two stages. Both the stages are examined
and the coupling between diffusion and the distribution of the Finite Time
Lyapunov Exponents is shown to be responsible for the pdf evolution.

reconstructed within the framework of the Buda-Lund hydrodynamical model, by
performing a simultaneous fit to final data on two-particle Bose-Einstein
correlations of the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations, and final identified single
particle spectra as measured by the PHENIX Collaboration. The results indicate
a strongly three-dimensional expansion with a four-velocity field that is
almost a spherically symmetric Hubble flow. We find large transverse
geometrical source sizes, R_G = 9.8 +- 1.2 fm, a relatively short mean
freeze-out time of tau0 = 6.1 +- 0.3 fm/c and a short duration of particle
emission, Delta_tau = 0.02 +- 1.5 fm/c. Most strikingly, we find an indication
for a hot central part or the hydrodynamically evolving core, characterized by
a central temperature of T0 = 202 +- 13 MeV, that is close to (or even above)
the deconfinement temperature of the quark-hadron phase transition. The best
fit indicates a cold surface temperature of T_s = 110 +- 16 MeV. When the
possibility of the hot center is excluded, the confidence level of the fit
decreases from 28.9 % to 1.2 %. Predictions are made for the rapidity
dependence of the slope parameters, for the transverse mass dependence of the
rapidity-width of the single-particle spectra, and for the transverse velocity
dependence of the non-indentical particle correlations.

  Substitution","6 pages, including 3 figures",,,,"physics.data-an cond-mat.stat-mech physics.comp-ph",,"  We argue that Non-sequential Recursive Pair Substitution (NSRPS) as suggested
by Jim\'enez-Monta\~no and Ebeling can indeed be used as a basis for an optimal
data compression algorithm. In particular, we prove for Markov sequences that
NSRPS together with suitable codings of the substitutions and of the substitute
series does not lead to a code length increase, in the limit of infinite
sequence length. When applied to written English, NSRPS gives entropy estimates
which are very close to those obtained by other methods. Using ca. 135 GB of
input data from the project Gutenberg, we estimate the effective entropy to be
$\approx 1.82$ bit/character. Extrapolating to infinitely long input, the true
value of the entropy is estimated as $\approx 0.8$ bit/character.

  rejected?","17 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.bio-ph q-bio",,"  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) often appear in clusters along the
length of a chromosome. This is due to variation in local coalescent times
caused by,for example, selection or recombination. Here we investigate whether
recombination alone (within a neutral model) can cause statistically
significant SNP clustering. We measure the extent of SNP clustering as the
ratio between the variance of SNPs found in bins of length $l$, and the mean
number of SNPs in such bins, $\sigma^2_l/\mu_l$. For a uniform SNP distribution
$\sigma^2_l/\mu_l=1$, for clustered SNPs $\sigma^2_l/\mu_l > 1$. Apart from the
bin length, three length scales are important when accounting for SNP
clustering: The mean distance between neighboring SNPs, $\Delta$, the mean
length of chromosome segments with constant time to the most recent common
ancestor, $\el$, and the total length of the chromosome, $L$. We show that SNP
clustering is observed if $\Delta < \el \ll L$. Moreover, if $l\ll \el \ll L$,
clustering becomes independent of the rate of recombination. We apply our
results to the analysis of SNP data sets from mice, and human chromosomes 6 and
X. Of the three data sets investigated, the human X chromosome displays the
most significant deviation from neutrality.

composed from sub-quantum particles and antiparticles, forming vortical
structures. These structures are presented by continuum of dipoles, each dipole
containing a pair of correlated torus and antitorus: V(+) and V(-) of the
opposite energy/mass, spin, charge and magnetic moments, compensating each
other. The rest mass and charge of sub-elementary fermions or antifermions is a
result of Bivacuum dipoles opposite symmetry shifts. Their fusion to triplets
follows by elementary particles and antiparticles origination. The [corpuscle
(C) - wave (W)] duality is a result of correlated beats between the 'actual'
and 'complementary' states of sub-elementary fermions of triplets. It is shown,
that Principle of least action, the 2d and 3d laws of thermodynamics can be a
consequences of forced combinational resonance between positive and negative
virtual pressure waves (VPW+/-) of Bivacuum and [C-W] pulsation of elementary
particles. The quantum entanglement, mediated by virtual microtubules, composed
from Bivacuum dipoles, connecting remote particles, is a result of such
Bivacuum-matter interaction. The pace of time for any closed system is
determined by pace of kinetic energy change of this system. The proposed
mechanism of overunity devices can be provided by the electrons acceleration,
induced by their resonant interaction with high frequency positive and negative
VPW+/- in pull-in range conditions. The latter can be excited by pulsing
currents and fields. The mechanism of overheating and cold fusion in
electrolytic cells without violation of energy conservation is proposed also.

  of Philosophy (Science) at Visva-Bharati, India",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The interaction of coherent light with a nonlinear medium is modeled here by
a general quantum anharmonic oscillator. The model is not exactly solvable in a
closed analytical form. But we need operator solutions of the equations of
motion corresponding to these models in order to study the quantum fluctuations
of coherent light in nonlinear media. In the present work we derive approximate
operator solutions. From these solutions we observe that there exists an
apparent discrepancy between the solutions obtained by different techniques. We
compare different solutions and conclude that all correct solutions are
equivalent and the apparent discrepancy is due to the use of different ordering
of the operators. We use these solutions to investigate the possibilities of
observing different optical phenomena in a nonlinear dielectric medium. To be
precise, we have studied quantum phase fluctuations of coherent light in a
third order inversion symmetric nonlinear medium. Fluctuations in phase space
quadrature for the same system are studied and the possibility of generating
squeezed state is reported. Fluctuations in photon number are studied and the
nonclassical phenomenon of antibunching is predicted. We have generalized the
results obtained for third order nonlinear medium and have studied the
interaction of an intense laser beam with a general (m-1)-th order nonlinear
medium. Aharanov Anandan nonadiabatic geometric phase is also discussed in the
context of (m-1)-th order nonlinear medium.
