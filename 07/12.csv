s-elements, or ls) and of Ba, La, Nd, Sm and Ce (high-mass s-elements, hs) are
derived using the spectral synthesis technique from high-resolution spectra.
The N-stars analyzed are of nearly solar metallicity and show moderate
s-element enhancements, similar to those found in S stars, but smaller than
those found in the only previous similar study (Utsumi 1985), and also smaller
than those found in supergiant post-AGB stars. This is in agreement with the
present understanding of the envelope s-element enrichment in giant stars,
which is increasing along the spectral sequence M-->MS-->S-->SC-->C during the
AGB phase. We compare the observational data with recent $s$-process
nucleosynthesis models for different metallicities and stellar masses. Good
agreement is obtained between low mass AGB star models (M < 3 M_o) and
s-elements observations. In low mass AGB stars, the 13C(alpha, n)16O reaction
is the main source of neutrons for the s-process; a moderate spread, however,
must exist in the abundance of 13C that is burnt in different stars. By
combining information deriving from the detection of Tc, the infrared colours
and the theoretical relations between stellar mass, metallicity and the final
C/O ratio, we conclude that most (or maybe all) of the N-stars studied in this
work are intrinsic, thermally-pulsing AGB stars; their abundances are the
consequence of the operation of third dredge-up and are not to be ascribed to
mass transfer in binary systems.

virial assumption for the broad emission lines, with the broad-line region size
determined from either reverberation mapping or optical luminosity. We
introduce 200 additional black hole mass estimates based on properties of the
host galaxy bulges, using either the observed stellar velocity dispersion or
using the fundamental plane relation to infer $\sigma$; these methods assume
that AGN hosts are normal galaxies. We compare 36 cases for which black hole
mass has been generated by different methods and find, for individual objects,
a scatter as high as a couple of orders of magnitude. The less direct the
method, the larger the discrepancy with other estimates, probably due to the
large scatter in the underlying correlations assumed. Using published fluxes,
we calculate bolometric luminosities for 234 AGNs and investigate the relation
between black hole mass and luminosity. In contrast to other studies, we find
no significant correlation of black hole mass with luminosity, other than those
induced by circular reasoning in the estimation of black hole mass. The
Eddington limit defines an approximate upper envelope to the distribution of
luminosities, but the lower envelope depends entirely on the sample of AGN
included. For any given black hole mass, there is a range in Eddington ratio of

unique information about high-energy processes in the universe. Numerous
sources for the EGRB have been proposed, but the two systems which are certain
to make some contribution are active galaxies (blazars) as well as normal
galaxies. In this paper, we evaluate the contribution to the background from
both sources. The active galaxy contribution arises from unresolved blazars. We
compute this contribution using the Stecker-Salamon model. For normal galaxies,
the emission is due to cosmic-ray interactions with diffuse gas. Our key
assumption here is that the cosmic-ray flux in a galaxy is proportional to the
supernova rate and thus the massive star formation rate, quantified
observationally by the cosmic star formation rate (CSFR). In addition, the
existence of stars today requires a considerably higher ISM mass in the past.
Using the CSFR to compute both these effects, we find that normal galaxies are
responsible for a significant portion (\sim 1/3) of the EGRB near 1 GeV, but
make a smaller contribution at other energies. Finally, we present a ""minimal""
two-component model which includes contributions from both normal galaxies and
blazars. We show that the spectrum of the diffuse radiation is a key constraint
on this model: while neither the blazar spectra, nor the galactic spectra, are
separately optimal fits to the observed spectrum, the combined emission
provides an excellent fit. We close by noting key observational tests of this
two-component model, which can be probed by future gamma-ray observatories such
as GLAST.

continuous spectra of real frequencies. Such modes are gravitational analogues
of the van Kampen modes of oscillation in plasmas. The characteristic value
problem governing modes of the van Kampen type in a galaxy is solved with the
aid of a modified version of the matrix method of Kalnajs in which the
perturbation of the distribution function is expressed in terms of generalized
functions. In general, there is no characteristic equation governing the
frequencies in the continuous spectrum. However, isolated frequencies in the
continuous spectrum do satisfy a characteristic equation which, for stellar
systems, is a counterpart of the dispersion relation proposed by Vlasov for
plasma oscillations. The linear analysis also provides a characteristic
equation for modes with a discrete spectrum of real and/or complex frequencies.
The second part of the paper describes a perturbation theory for a stationary
oscillation of a galaxy with a small but finite amplitude. Integrals of the
stellar motion are constructed with the aid of canonical perturbation theory
and used in conjunction with the theorem of Jeans in order to specify the
density of stars in the six-dimensional phase space. These oscillations are
slightly nonlinear counterparts of the modes of the van Kampen type, and they
are stellar-dynamical counterparts of the nonlinear plasma waves described by
Bernstein, Greene, and Kruskal. Fully nonlinear models of stationary
oscillations of galaxies can be constructed with the aid of Schwarzschild's
numerical method for the solution of the fundamental integral equation

strong acceleration of the flame in the polar direction. This results in a
strong asymmetry in the geometry of the just formed core of hot SQM which

with ROSAT. A transient event, which lasted about 900 s, was detected
simultaneously by the X-ray instruments and, in the UV, by the Optical Monitor.
The transient was likely caused by the impact of 10^17-10^18 g of gas on the

is consistent with 7 keV thermal bremsstrahlung from the shock-heated gas in

primary coolant of diffuse interstellar gas. We describe observations of [CII]
emission towards nine high Galactic latitude translucent molecular clouds, made
with the long wavelength spectrometer on board the Infrared Space Observatory.
To understand the role of dust grains in processing the interstellar radiation
field (ISRF) and heating the gas, we compare the [CII] integrated intensity
with the far-infrared (FIR) integrated surface brightness for the 101 sampled
lines of sight. We find that [CII] is linearly correlated with FIR, and the
average ratio is equal to that measured with the COBE satellite for all
high-latitude Milky Way gas. There is a significant decrease that was not
detected with COBE in [CII] emissivity at high values of FIR. Our sample splits
naturally into two populations depending on the 60um/100um surface brightness
ratio, or color: ``warm'' positions and ``cold'' positions. A transition from
sources with warm to those with cold 60/100 colors coincides approximately with
the transition from constant to decreasing [CII] emissivity. We model the [CII]
and far-infrared emission under conditions of thermal equilibrium, using the
simplifying assumptions that, in all regions heated by the ISRF, the most
important source of gas heating is the photoelectric effect on grains and the
most important source of gas cooling is [CII] emission. The model matches the
data well. There are no statistically significant differences in the derived
values of the ISRF intensity and the photoelectric heating efficiency for warm
and cold sources. The observed variations in the [CII] emissivity and the
60/100 colors can be understood entirely in terms of the attenuation and
softening of the ISRF by translucent clouds, not changes in dust properties.

in the hard X-ray spectra of Seyfert galaxies, could be formed on an extended
medium, at large distance from the central source of primary radiation (e.g. on
a torus). Then, the reflector cannot respond to the rapid fluctuations of the
primary source. The observed reflected flux is controlled by the time-averaged
primary spectrum rather than the instantaneous (observed) one. We show that
this effect strongly influences the spectral fit parameters derived under the
assumption of a reflection component consistent with the primary radiation. We
find that a pivoting primary power-law spectrum with a nearly constant
Comptonised luminosity may account for the reported correlation between the
reflection amplitude R and the spectral index Gamma, and simultaneously
produces an iron line EW that is nearly independent of Gamma. We emphasize the
effects of the modelling of the primary component on the determination of the

stars during which the central region collapses. Recent explosion scenarios
assumed that the ejection is due to energy deposition by neutrinos into the

and mounting evidence for an asphericity and, in particular, for axial symmetry
in several SNe which may be hard to reconcile within the spherical picture.
This evidence includes the observed high polarization and its variation with
time, pulsar kicks, high velocity iron-group and intermediate-mass elements
material observed in remnants, direct observations of the debris of SN1987A
etc. Some of the new evidence is discussed in more detail. To be in agreement
with the observations, any successful mechanism must invoke some sort of axial
symmetry for the explosion. We consider jet-induced/dominated explosions of
core collapse SNe. Our study is based on detailed 3-D hydrodynamical and
radiation transport models We find that the observations can be explained by
low velocity, massive jets which stall well within the SN envelope. Such
outflows may be produced by MHD- mechanisms, convective dominated accretion
disks on the central object or asymmetric neutrino emissions. Asymmetric
density/chemical distributions and, for SN2002ap, off-center energy depositions
have been identified as crucial for the interpretation of the polarization.

pressure throughout the remnant we estimate the total remnant mass as 10 Msun

distribution as a function of ionisation age for both X-ray emitting
components. This distribution is consistent with a hot component dominated by
swept up mass heated by the primary shock and a cool component which are
ablated clumpy ejecta material which were and are still being heated by
interaction with the preheated swept up material. We calculate a balanced mass
and energy budget for the supernova explosion giving 1E44 J in ejected mass;
approximately 0.4 Msun of the ejecta were diffuse with an initial rms velocity
of 15000 km/s while the remaining ~1.8 Msun were clumpy with an initial rms
velocity of ~2400 km/s. Using the Doppler velocity measurements of the X-ray
spectral lines we can project the mass into spherical coordinates about the

supernova explosion. The mass and energy occupy less than 4.5 sr (<40 % of the
available solid angle) around the remnant and 64 % of the mass occurs in two
jets within 45 degrees of a jet axis. We calculate a swept up mass of 7.9 Msun

Baldwin 1985) concluded that the kinematic center of the galaxy is displaced
\~220 pc from the apparent mass center of the galaxy, and the ionized gas
follows a remarkably normal rotation curve. Our analysis based on the stellar
kinematics, 2D ionized gas velocity field and dispersion velocity, and high
spatial resolution morphology at V, I and Halpha reveals that: 1) The kinematic
center of NGC 2110 is at the nucleus of the galaxy. 2) The ionized gas is not
in pure rotational motion. 3) The morphology of the 2D distribution of the
emission line widths suggests the presence of a minor axis galactic outflow. 4)
The nucleus is blue-shifted with respect to the stellar systemic velocity,
suggesting the NLR gas is out-flowing due to the interaction with the radio
jet. 5) The ionized gas is red-shifted ~100 km/s over the corresponding
rotational motion south of the nucleus, and 240 km/s with respect to the
nuclear stellar systemic velocity. This velocity is coincident with the HI
red-shifted absorption velocity detected by Gallimore et al (1999). We discuss
the possibility that the kinematics of the south ionized gas could be perturbed
by the collision with a small satellite that impacted on NGC 2110 close to the
center with a highly inclined orbit. Additional support for this interpretation
are the radial dust lanes and tidal debris detected in the V un-sharp masked
image. We suggest that a minor-merger may have driven the nuclear activity in
NGC 2110.

frequencies and the electron-phonon coupling in hcp Fe as a function of the
lattice parameter, using the linear response (LR) scheme and the full potential
linear muffin-tin orbital (FP-LMTO) method. Calculated phonon spectra and the
Eliashberg functions $\alpha^2 F$ indicate that conventional s-wave
electron-phonon coupling can definitely account for the appearance of the
superconducting phase in hcp Fe. However, the observed change in the transition
temperature with increasing pressure is far too rapid compared with the
calculated results. For comparison with the linear response results, we have
computed the electron-phonon coupling also by using the rigid muffin-tin (RMT)
approximation. From both the LR and the RMT results it appears that
electron-phonon interaction alone cannot explain the small range of volume over
which superconductivity is observed. It is shown that
ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations as well as scattering from
magnetic impurities (spin-ordered clusters) can account for the observed values
of the transition temperatures but cannot substantially improve the agreeemnt
between the calculated and observed presure/volume range of the superconducting
phase. A simplified treatment of p-wave pairing leads to extremely small ($\leq
10^{-2}$ K) transition temperatures. Thus our calculations seem to rule out
both $s$- and $p$- wave superconductivity in hcp Fe.

simply appending $B$ after $A$. We show the existence of a universal scaling
function (the so-called learning function) which rules the way in which the
compression algorithm learns a sequence $B$ after having compressed a sequence
$A$. In particular it turns out that it exists a crossover length for the
sequence $B$, which depends on the relative entropy between $A$ and $B$, below
which the compression algorithm does not learn the sequence $B$ (measuring in
this way the relative entropy between $A$ and $B$) and above which it starts
learning $B$, i.e. optimizing the compression using the specific features of
$B$. We check the scaling function on three main classes of systems: Bernoulli
schemes, Markovian sequences and the symbolic dynamic generated by a non
trivial chaotic system (the Lozi map). As a last application of the method we
present the results of a recognition experiment, namely recognize which

be used to improve inference from propositional weighted bases. We present a
general notion of compilation of a weighted base that is parametrized by any
equivalence--preserving compilation function. Both negative and positive
results are presented. On the one hand, complexity results are identified,
showing that the inference problem from a compiled weighted base is as
difficult as in the general case, when the prime implicates, Horn cover or
renamable Horn cover classes are targeted. On the other hand, we show that the
inference problem becomes tractable whenever DNNF-compilations are used and
clausal queries are considered. Moreover, we show that the set of all preferred
models of a DNNF-compilation of a weighted base can be computed in time
polynomial in the output size. Finally, we sketch how our results can be used
in model-based diagnosis in order to compute the most probable diagnoses of a
system.

non- singlet particles yielding a picture dual to the Dual Standard model of
Vachaspati. This Asymptotic Slavery (AS) fixed point is driven by realistic
Fermion Mass(FM) Higgs content which implies AS. This defines a dynamical
morphogenetic scenario dependent on the dynamics of UV strong N=1 Susy
Gauge-Chiral(SGC) theories. Such systems are already understood in the AF case
but ignored in the AS case. Analogy to the AFSGC suggests the perturbative SM
gauge group of the Grand Desert confines at GUT scales i.e GUT symmetry is
``non-restored''. Restoration before confinement and self-inconsistency are the
two other (less likely) logical possibilities. Truly Minimal (TM) SU(5) and
SO(10) models with matter and FM Higgs only are defined; AM (adjoint multiplet
type) Higgs may be introduced for a Classical Phase Transition (CPT)
description. Renormalizability and R-Parity leave only the low energy (SM) data
as free parameters in the TM (Quantum PT) case. Besides ab initio resolution of
the Heirarchy problem and choice of Susy vacuum, fresh perspectives on particle
elementarity and duality, doublet triplet splitting, proton decay suppression,
soft Susy masses etc open up. ``Elastic'' (spin 2 and spin 3/2) fluctuations of
the AS (or pleromal) condensate coupling universally to SM particles with
length scale l_U ~ l_{Pl} imply an effective N=1 (super)gravity in the Grand

investigated by the 50 GeV primary proton facility. The distributions at medium
x are determined, for example, by Drell-Yan measurements. Second, there are
feasibility studies to propose a neutrino factory within the 50 GeV proton
ring. If such an intensive high-energy neutrino facility is built, neutrino
reactions should be able to provide valuable information on the PDFs, whereas
the current structure functions have been measured mainly for neutrino-iron

hadrons [20],[21]. As a large amount of new precision measurements appear, and,
on the other hand, our understanding of QCD becomes deeper, a new level of
understanding of quark-gluon physics in the region of soft interactions forces
us to review the relations of quark combinatorics. To do so, an especially good

example of thermally driven spreading on a horizontal surface to study how the
stability of the flow can be altered, or patterns selected, using feedback
control. We show that thermal perturbations of certain spatial structure
imposed behind the contact line and proportional to the deviation of the
contact line from its mean position can completely suppress the instability.
Due to the presence of mean flow and a spatially nonuniform nature of spreading
liquid films the dynamics of disturbances is governed by a nonnormal evolution
operator, opening up a possibility of transient amplification and nonlinear
instabilities. We show that in the case of thermal driving the nonnormality can
be significant, especially for small wavenumber disturbances, and trace the
origin of transient amplification to a close alignment of a large group of
eigenfunctions of the evolution operator. However, for values of noise likely
to occur in experiments we find that the transient amplification is not
sufficiently strong to either change the predictions of the linear stability
analysis or invalidate the proposed control approach.

  resolution of the water Tg controversy","23 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph",,"  The possibility of observing a glass transition in water before
crystallisation occurs has been debated vigorously but inconclusively over five
decades [1,2]. For two decades a glass transition at 136K [2,3] was accepted
but this transition has perplexing qualities [4]. Recently it has been
argued[2,5],that this assignment must be wrong. The re-assignment of Tg to
temperatures above the 150K crystallisation was vigorously contested [6]. Here
we use detailed anneal-and-scan studies of a hyperquenched inorganic glass,
which does not crystallize on heating, to interpret the perplexing aspects of
the 136K water phenomenon. We show that it is indeed linked to a glass
transition, though only via a cross-over phenomenon. The thermal history that
gives the same behaviour (""shadow"" glass transition) in the inorganic glass is
linked by crossover to a ""normal"" glass transition 23% higher in temperature.
Thus a Tg is indeed unobservable for water, while the vitreous nature of
hyperquenched glassy water is strongly supported. The shadow Tg is reproducible
in the inorganic glass as it is in H2O. The observed aging dynamics are very
relevant to current glass theory, particularly to dynamical heterogeneity which
is seen to have an energy manifestation.

switch-like cellular module; the response coefficient of the sensitivity
amplification approaches the optimal 1 and the Hill coefficient increases with
increasing $\Delta G$. We discover that zero-order ultrasensitivity is
mathematically equivalent to allosteric cooperativity. Furthermore, we show
that the high amplification in ultrasensitivity is mechanistically related to
the proofreading kinetics for protein biosynthesis. Both utilize multiple
kinetic cycles in time to gain temporal cooperativity, in contrast to
allosteric cooperativity that utilizes multiple subunits in a protein.

far-reaching development of the special relativity theory. One of the main
principles of the special relativity theory is that two physical systems that
are moving relative to each other have different times and it is necessary to
use a correspondence between clocks in these systems to coordinate their times.
Such correspondence is established by means of electromagnetic signals. In
accordance with this principle, it is postulated in the system theory of time
that each system has its own time. In some cases, two systems have the same
time. In other cases, times of systems are coordinated or correlated. However,
there are systems in which times are independent from one another.

mechanics. It is claimed by some authors that a single particle prepared in a
superposition of N+1 box locations and which is subject to a final
``post-selection'' measurement corresponding to a different superposition can
be said to have occupied ``with certainty'' N boxes during the intervening
time. However, others have argued that under closer inspection, this surprising
claim fails to hold. Aharonov and Vaidman have continued their advocacy of the
claim in question by proposing a variation on the N-box experiment, in which
the boxes are replaced by shutters and the pre- and post-selected particle is
entangled with a photon. These authors argue that the resulting ``N-shutter
experiment'' strengthens their original claim regarding the N-box experiment.
It is argued in this paper that the apparently surprising features of this
variation are no more robust than those of the N-box experiment and that it is
not accurate to say that the particle is ``with certainty'' in all N shutters
at any given time.
