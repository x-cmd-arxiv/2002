One of the binary systems -- HD 114762 -- was not previously known to be a
spatially resolved multiple system; additional data taken with the combination
of Keck adaptive optics and NIRSPEC are used to characterize the new companion.
The second binary system -- Tau Boo -- was a known multiple with two
conflicting orbital solutions; the current data will help constrain the
discrepant estimates of periastron time and separation. Another target -- 16
Cyg B -- was a known common proper motion binary, but the current data resolve
a new third component, close to the wide companion 16 Cyg A. Both the HD 114762

binary contains an extremely close planet in a tidally-circularized orbit.
Although the sample is currently small, the proportion of binary systems is
comparable to that measured in the field over a similar separation range.
Incorporating the null result from another companion search project lowers the
overall fraction of planets in binary systems, but the detections in our survey
reveal that planets can form in binaries separated by less than 50 AU.

the conservative frequentist's point of view the validity of null hypothesis of
the zero cosmological constant is tested by the classical statistical chi^2
test for the 60 supernovae listed in Perlmutter et al. 1999 (ApJ, 517, 565).
This sample contains 42 objects discovered in the frame of Supernova Cosmology
Project and 18 low-redshift object detected earlier. Excluding the event
SN1997O, which is doubtlessly an outlier, one obtains the result: The
probability for seeing a worse chi^2 - if the null hypothesis is true - is in
the 5% to 8% range, a value that does not indicate significant evidence againts
the null. If one excludes further five possible outliers, proposed to be done
by Perlmutter et al. 1999, then the sample of 54 supernovae is in an excellent
accordance with the null hypothesis. It also seems that upernovae from the
High-z Supernova Search Team does not change the acceptance of null hypothesis.
This means that the rejection of the Einstein equations with zero cosmological

Approximately 60% of the sky (and perhaps as much as 85%) is covered by high

associated with known high velocity HI structures (e.g., the Magellanic Stream,
Complexes A and C), while some OVI features have no counterpart in HI 21cm
emission. The smaller dispersion in the OVI velocities in the GSR and LGSR
reference frames compared to the LSR is necessary (but not conclusive) evidence
that some of the clouds are extragalactic. Most of the OVI cannot be produced
by photoionization, even if the gas is irradiated by extragalactic background
radiation. Collisions in hot gas are the primary OVI ionization mechanism. We
favor production of some of the OVI at the boundaries between warm clouds and a

immersed within an HII region. The globule is assumed to be spherical,
homogeneous, optically thin in the IR and photoevaporated according to the
Dyson (1968) model. Second, we consider the IR emission of a disk directly
exposed to the nebular environment. The disk is passive and treated according
to the Chiang and Goldreich (1997) model. We improve over the CG97 treatment by
tracing the propagation of the various radiative fluxes through the disk
superheated atmosphere. Since the opposite disk sides receive different amounts
of radiation, the flaring angle and the surface temperature distributions are
different, resulting in well distinguished SEDs for the two disk faces.
Finally, we combine the globule and disk models to estimate the IR emission of
proplyds. The energy input from the central star and the nebular environment
increase the disk flaring angle, and therefore also the amount of stellar
radiation intercepted by the disk. The relative intensity of the disk vs.
envelope emission varies with the tilt angle relative to the directions of
th1Ori-C, and of the Earth. We explore the dependence of the SEDs upon the tilt
angle with respect to the Earth, the distance from th1Ori-C, the size on the
envelope, the inner disk radius and the temperature of the central star. The
resulting SEDs are characterized by a broad peak of emission at 30-60micron,

(dz=0.25) and absolute magnitude (dMb=0.5) bins. The median number of QSOs in
each composite is ~200, yielding typical S/N of ~100. For a given redshift
interval, the composite spectra cover a factor of over 25 in luminosity. Using
the composite spectra we have measured the equivalent widths (EWs) of the major
broad and narrow emission lines, and the CaII K absorption feature due to the
host galaxy of the AGN. Assuming a fixed host galaxy spectral energy
distribution (SED), the correlation between CaII K EW and luminosity implies
Lgal proportional to Lqso**{0.42+-0.05}. We find strong anti-correlations with
luminosity for the EWs of [OII] and [NeV]. These provide hints to the general
fading of the NLR in high luminosity sources which we attribute to the NLR
dimensions becoming larger than the host galaxy. If average AGN host galaxies
have SEDs similar to average galaxies, then the observed narrow [OII] emission
could be solely due to the host galaxy at low luminosities (M_B~-20). We
measure highly significant Baldwin effects for most broad emission lines (CIV,

correlations with luminosity, not redshift. We find that the Hbeta and Hgamma
Balmer lines show an inverse Baldwin effect and are positively correlated with

coronae above and have a profound effect on the mass flow rate in the corona.
This strongly affects the location where the accretion flow changes from a
geometrically thin disk to a pure vertically extended coronal or
advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). We show that this can explain the
different disk truncation radii in elliptical galaxies and low luminosity AGN
with about the same mass flow rate, a discrepancy pointed out by Quataert et
al. (1999). Without disk magnetic activity the disk truncation is expected to
be uniquely related to the mass flow rate (Meyer et al. 2000b). Whether dynamo
action occurs depends on whether the electrical conductivity measured by a
magnetic Reynolds number surpasses a critical value (Gammie and Menou 1998).In
elliptical galaxies the disk is self-gravitating at the radii where the

of clouds'' may form (Shlosman et al. 1990, Gammie 2001) for which no dynamo
action is expected. For low luminosity AGN the magnetic Reynolds number is well
above critical. Simple model calculations show that magnetic fields in the
underlying disks reduce the strength of the coronal flow and shift the

investigate whether nu bar{nu} annihilation can provide sufficient energy to

reached a maximum, stationary level are analyzed to address this question. We
find that nu bar{nu} annihilation can provide the necessary driving stresses
that lead to relativistic jet expansion. Maximum Lorentz factors of the order
of 15 are found along the binary rotation axis, but larger values are expected
to arise from higher numerical resolution. Yet the accompanying neutrino-driven
wind must be absent from the axis when the burst occurs or prohibitive baryon
loading may occur. We argue that even under the most favorable conditions, nu
bar{nu} annihilation is unlikely to power a burst in excess of ~ 10^{48} erg.
Unless the emission is beamed into less than one percent of the solid angle,
which we argue is improbable if it is collimated by gas pressure, this may fail
to satisfy the apparent isotropic energies inferred at cosmological distances.
This mechanism may nonetheless drive a precursor fireball, thereby evacuating a
cavity into which a later magnetic driven jet could expand. A large range of
time delays between the merger and the black hole formation are to be expected.
If the magnetic driven jet occurs after the black hole has formed, a time span
as long as weeks could pass between the neutrino powered precursor and the

V = (n hbar Omega)/(2e), where Omega is the cavity frequency, and n is
generally an integer; (ii) a threshold number N_c of active rows of junctions
above which the array is coherent; and (iii) a time-averaged cavity energy
which is quadratic in the number of active junctions, when the array is above

we find a conspicuous polarization effect: if the cavity mode is polarized
perpendicular to the direction of current injection in a square array, it does
not couple to the array and there is no power radiated into the cavity. We
speculate that the perpendicular polarization would couple to the array, in the
presence of magnetic-field-induced frustration. Finally, when the array is
biased on a SIRS, then, for given junction parameters, the power radiated into
the array is found to vary as the square of the number of active junctions,

We present two methods to obtain high-order weakly nonlinear results. Using the
system size as a control parameter, we circumvent the problem that there is no
instability threshold for an extended system in the absence of gravity. This
way, the case without gravity becomes accessible to a weakly nonlinear
treatment. The dependence of the branch structure of solution space on the
level of gravity (or density difference) is exhibited. In the zero-gravity
limit, we recover the solution branch obtained by Spencer and Meiron. A
transition from a supercritical to a subcritical bifurcation is observed as
gravity is increased or the nonhydrostatic stress is decreased at fixed
gravity. At given values of the system parameters, we find a discrete, possibly
infinite, set of solution branches. This is reminiscent of dendritic or
eutectic growth, where similar solution sets exist, of which only a particular
one is linearly stable. Despite the high order of our expansions, the approach
is restricted to relatively small nondimensional amplitudes ($\lesssim 0.2$), a
disadvantage we can overcome by a variational approach that will be discussed
in a companion paper. At the critical point, we find that not only the first
Landau coefficient is negative but all of them up to the highest amplitude

  (http://floc02.diku.dk/PCL/)",,,,"cs.LO",,"  This paper studies axioms for nonmonotonic consequences from a
semantics-based point of view, focusing on a class of mathematical structures
for reasoning about partial information without a predefined syntax/logic. This
structure is called a default structure. We study axioms for the nonmonotonic
consequence relation derived from extensions as in Reiter's default logic,
using skeptical reasoning, but extensions are now used for the construction of
possible worlds in a default information structure.
  In previous work we showed that skeptical reasoning arising from
default-extensions obeys a well-behaved set of axioms including the axiom of
cautious cut. We show here that, remarkably, the converse is also true: any
consequence relation obeying this set of axioms can be represented as one
constructed from skeptical reasoning. We provide representation theorems to
relate axioms for nonmonotonic consequence relation and properties about
extensions, and provide one-to-one correspondence between nonmonotonic systems
which satisfies the law of cautious monotony and default structures with unique
extensions. Our results give a theoretical justification for a set of basic
rules governing the update of nonmonotonic knowledge bases, demonstrating the
derivation of them from the more concrete and primitive construction of
extensions. It is also striking to note that proofs of the representation
theorems show that only shallow extensions are necessary, in the sense that the
number of iterations needed to achieve an extension is at most three. All of
these developments are made possible by taking a more liberal view of
consistency: consistency is a user defined predicate, satisfying some basic
properties.

from inconsistency. A paraconsistent logic is a logic where an inconsistency
does not lead to such an explosion, and since in practice consistency is
difficult to achieve there are many potential applications of paraconsistent
logics in knowledge-based systems, logical semantics of natural language, etc.
Higher order logics have the advantages of being expressive and with several
automated theorem provers available. Also the type system can be helpful. We
present a concise description of a paraconsistent higher order logic with
countable infinite indeterminacy, where each basic formula can get its own
indeterminate truth value (or as we prefer: truth code). The meaning of the
logical operators is new and rather different from traditional many-valued
logics as well as from logics based on bilattices. The adequacy of the logic is
examined by a case study in the domain of medicine. Thus we try to build a
bridge between the HOL and MVL communities. A sequent calculus is proposed
based on recent work by Muskens.

Ricci tensor that contains a term proportional to a Dirac delta-function
supported on the hypersurface. This singularity is associated with a thin
distribution of matter on the hypersurface, and following Barrabes and Israel,
we seek to determine its stress-energy tensor in terms of the geometric
properties of the null hypersurface. While our treatment here does not deviate
strongly from their previous work, it offers a simplification of the
computational operations involved in a typical application of the formalism,
and it gives rise to a stress-energy tensor that possesses a more recognizable
phenomenology. Our reformulation of the null-shell formalism makes systematic
use of the null generators of the singular hypersurface, which define a
preferred flow to which the flow of matter can be compared. This construction
provides the stress-energy tensor with a simple characterization in terms of a
mass density, a mass current, and an isotropic pressure. Our reformulation also
involves a family of freely-moving observers that intersect the surface layer
and perform measurements on it. This construction gives operational meaning to
the stress-energy tensor by fixing the argument of the delta-function to be
proper time as measured by these observers.

gravitational wave waveform of a binary system to model the signal seen in a
spaceborne gravitational wave detector such as the proposed LISA detector.
Covariance studies are then performed to determine the ultimate accuracy to be
expected when the parameters of the source are fit to the received signal. We
find three areas where the higher harmonics contribute crucial information that
breaks degeneracies in the model and allows otherwise badly-correlated
parameters to be separated and determined. First, we find that the position of
a coalescing massive black hole binary in an ecliptic plane detector, such as
OMEGA, is well-determined with the help of these harmonics. Second, we find
that the individual masses of the stars in a chirping neutron star binary can
be separated because of the mass dependence of the harmonic contributions to
the wave. Finally, we note that supermassive black hole binaries, whose
frequencies are too low to be seen in the detector sensitivity window for long,
may still have their masses, distances, and positions determined since the
information content of the higher harmonics compensates for the information
lost when the orbit-induced modulation of the signal does not last long enough

that there exists a parametric family of spacetimes that can be Taylor expanded
around a background. The choice of the latter is crucial to obtain a manageable
theory, so that it is sometime convenient to construct a perturbative formalism
based on two (or more) parameters. The study of perturbations of rotating stars
is a good example: in this case one can treat the stationary axisymmetric star
using a slow rotation approximation (expansion in the angular velocity Omega),
so that the background is spherical. Generic perturbations of the rotating star
(say parametrized by lambda) are then built on top of the axisymmetric
perturbations in Omega. Clearly, any interesting physics requires non-linear
perturbations, as at least terms lambda Omega need to be considered. In this
paper we analyse the gauge dependence of non-linear perturbations depending on
two parameters, derive explicit higher order gauge transformation rules, and
define gauge invariance. The formalism is completely general and can be used in
different applications of general relativity or any other spacetime theory.

The measurement is based on a new technique involving BBbar events in which one

determined from a kinematic fit to the whole event. For different minimum

of an isolated Josephon junction or a superconducting single-electron
transistor (SSET), we obtain an asymptotical representation of Mathieu
functions. We solve the discretised harmonic oscillator by transforming the
infinite-dimensional matrix-eigenvalue problem into an infinite set of
algebraic equations which are later shown to be satisfied by the obtained
solution. The proposed ansatz defines a new class of generalised Hermite
polynomials which are explicit functions of the coupling parameter and tend to
ordinary Hermite polynomials in the limit of vanishing coupling constant. The
polynomials become orthogonal as parts of the eigenvectors of a Hermitian
matrix and, consequently, the exponential part of the solution can not be

developed a domain-type Hermite RBF scheme called the modified Kansa method,

symmetrical locally free resolution. The structure theorem gives necessary and
sufficient conditions for such a length 1 locally free symmetrical resolution
of a sheaf F on P^3 in order that $Spec (mathcal F)$ yield a canonically
projected surface of general type. The result was found in 1983 by the first
author in the regular case, and the main ingredient here for the irregular (=
non Cohen-Macaulay) case is to replace the use of Hilbert resolutions with the
use of Beilinson's monads. Most of the paper is devoted then to the analysis of
irregular canonical surfaces with p_g=4 and low degree (the analysis in the
regular case had been initiated by F. Enriques). For q=1 we classify completely
the (irreducible) moduli space for the minimal value K^2=12. We also study
other moduli spaces, q=2, K^2=18, and q=3, K^2=12. The last family is provided
by the divisors in a (1,1,2) polarization on some Abelian 3-fold. A remarkable
subfamily is given by the pull backs, under a 2-isogeny, of the theta divisor
of a p.p.Abelian 3-fold: for those surfaces the canonical map is a double cover
of a canonical surface (i.e., such that its canonical map is birational). The
canonical image is a sextic surface with a plane cubic as double curve, and
moreover with an even set of 32 nodes as remaining singular locus. Our method
allows to write the equations of these transcendental objects, but not yet to
construct new ones by computer algebra.

of a Langmuir wave in an unmagnetized plasma gives rise to a Landau-type
damping. Starting from the Zakharov equations, which describe the nonlinear
interaction between Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves, a kinetic equation is
derived for the plasmons by introducing the Wigner-Moyal transform of the
complex Langmuir wave field. This equation is then used to analyze the
stability properties of small perturbations on a stationary solution consisting
of a constant amplitude wave with stochastic phase noise. The concomitant
dispersion relation exhibits the phenomenon of Landau-like damping. However,
this damping differs from the classical Landau damping in which a Langmuir
wave, interacting with the plasma electrons, loses energy. In the present
process, the damping is non-dissipative and is caused by the resonant
interaction between an instantaneously-produced disturbance, due to the
parametric interactions, and a partially incoherent Langmuir wave, which can be
considered as a quasi-particle composed of an ensemble of partially incoherent
plasmons.

chlorophylls that absorbs light and delivers the resulting electronic
excitation to the special pair of chlorophylls where the excitation energy is
used for producing charge separation across the cell membrane. The seemingly
random arrangement of chlorophylls in photosystem I poses the question which
pathways excitation migration follows towards the special pair after absorption
of light at any of its chlorophylls. We employ a master equation to describe
the process of excitation migration in photosystem I, and find representative
paths of excitation migration based on the mean first-passage time from each
chlorophyll to the special pair. The resulting paths, beginning at each of the
chlorophylls and ending at the special pair, provide a complete yet distilled
picture of the excitation migration towards the special pair.

wave function simulations and the collision rate is obtained by monitoring the
quantum flux beyond the average distance between the atoms. To illustrate the
usefulness of the method, we calculate the collision rates for a wide range of
occupation densities and various modulation depths of the lattice. The method
presented here combined with the semiclassical calculations accounting for
intra-well collisions can simplify the study of the effects of binary
collisions on the dynamics of atomic clouds trapped in near-resonant optical
lattices.

classical and quantum bits secret in a number of different circumstances. Among

data hiding. In this paper we show that a method for keeping two classical bits
hidden in any such scenario can be used to construct a method for keeping one
quantum bit hidden, and vice--versa. In the realm of quantum data hiding, this
allows us to construct bipartite and multipartite hiding schemes for qubits
from the previously known constructions for hiding bits. Our method also gives
a simple proof that two bits of shared randomness are required to construct a
private quantum channel hiding one qubit.

periodic orbits in the Gutzwiller trace formula of chaotic systems. We
investigate these tools in the context of integrable systems to which these
techniques have not been previously applied. Our specific model is a
stroboscopic map of an integrable Hamiltonian system with quadratic action
dependence, for which each stage of the semiclassical approximation can be
controlled. It is found that large errors occur in the semiclassical traces due
to edge corrections which may be neglected if the eigenvalues are obtained by
Fourier transformation over the long time dynamics. However, these errors cause
serious harm to the spectral approximations of an integrable system obtained
via the spectral determinants. The symmetry property of the spectral
determinant does not generally alleviate the error, since it sometimes sheds a
pair of eigenvalues from the unit circle. By taking into account the leading
order asymptotics of the edge corrections, the spectral determinant method
makes a significant recovery.

optimization of estimation scheme, to find a lower bound to the error of the

in quantities with singularity, e.g. concurrence etc. In the paper, lower
bounds to a Mean Square Error (MSE) of an estimator are derived for a quantum
estimation problem without smoothness assumptions. Our main idea is to replace
the derivative by difference, as is done in classical estimation theory. We
applied the inequalities to several examples, and derived optimal estimator for
