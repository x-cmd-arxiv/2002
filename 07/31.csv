value ~ 1/30 solar at z ~ 3 to a nearly solar value at z ~ 0. However, several
previous analyses have suggested that there is little or no evolution in the

quantify the global metallicity-redshift relation and its uncertainties, taking
into account both measurement and sampling errors. Three new features of our
analysis are: (a) an unbinned N(H I)-weighted nonlinear chi-square fit to an
exponential relation; (b) survival analysis to treat the large number of limits
in the existing data; and (c) a comparison of the data with several models of
cosmic chemical evolution based on an unbinned N(H I)-weighted chi-square. We
find that a wider range of evolutionary rates is allowed by the present data
than claimed in previous studies. The slope of the exponential fit to the N(H
I)-weighted mean Zn metallicity vs. redshift relation is -0.20 plus minus 0.11
counting limits as detections and -0.27 plus minus 0.12 counting limits as
zeros. Similar results are also obtained if the data are binned in redshift,

some cluster environmental effect. We note that galaxies of this type may be

r^1/4 profile in both the F814W & F110W data with an effective radius of 0.30
arcsec (2.7 kpc). The restframe U-B colour gradient requires a stellar
population of super-solar (3Z_sun) metallicity that formed on a very short
timescale at high redshift (z>5). 53W091 has a regular r^1/4 profile in F110W
with an effective radius of 0.32 arcsec (2.9 kpc). The F814W profile is more
extended and is consistent with a blue exponential disk that contributes 20% of
the flux within r_e. The restframe U-B colour gradient is significantly larger
than that observed in field ellipticals at z<1, implying a stellar population
of mixed metallicity (1-3Z_sun) that formed in a high-redshift rapid burst.
  We have compared these two LBDS radio galaxies with the Kormendy relation of
ten 3CR radio galaxies at z=0.8. The LBDS galaxies follow the same relation as
the more radio-luminous 3CR galaxies, assuming passive evolution of their
stellar populations, although they are smaller than the 3CR galaxies whose mean
effective radius is 12 kpc. Their sizes and radio luminosities are consistent
with scaling relations applied to the 3CR galaxies, in which both radio power
and effective radius scale with galaxy mass. Compared with a sample of z=0.4
cluster ellipticals, 53W069 & 53W091 lie well within the scatter of the
Kormendy relation. We conclude that the hosts of these mJy radio sources at
z=1.5 are passively-evolving elliptical galaxies that will evolve into ordinary
L* ellipticals by the present day. (Abridged)

0$. Furthermore, in analogy with the edge waves of electronic quantum Hall
states, these excitations are {\it chiral}, that is, they can be excited only
for values of $l$ that increase the total angular momentum of the vortex
liquid. However, differently from the quantum Hall phenomena for electrons, we
also find other excitations that are approximately degenerate in the laboratory
frame with the surface modes, and which decrease the total angular momentum by
$l$ quanta. The surface modes of the Laughlin, as well as other scalar and
vector boson states are analyzed, and their {\it observable} properties
characterized. We argue that measurement of the response of a vortex liquid to
a weak time-dependent potential that imparts angular momentum to the system
should provide valuable information to characterize the vortex liquid. In
particular, the intensity of the signal of the surface waves in the dynamic
structure factor has been studied and found to depend on the type of vortex
liquid. We point out that the existence of surface modes has observable
consequences on the density profile of the Laughlin state. These features are
due to the strongly correlated behavior of atoms in the vortex liquids. We
point out that these correlations should be responsible for a remarkable

argues that the disorder average local density of states diverges as

extended to the case when time-reversal symmetry is present (chiral orthogonal

crystalline GaN, in particular in the conduction band, are dramatic. Employing
the orbital character and elemental specificity of the SXE/SXA spectroscopies,
we identify a charge transfer from the N atoms at the valence band maximum,
reducing the overlap with the wavefunction in conduction band minimum, as the
main factor limiting the optical efficiency of GaAs1-xNx alloys. Moreover, a
k-conserving process of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering involving the L1

the other series, the samples are annealed for 51 h at 160C prior to testing.
  A constitutive model is developed for the viscoplastic behavior of isotactic
polypropylene at finite strains. A semicrystalline polymer is treated as an
equivalent heterogeneous network of chains bridged by permanent junctions
(physical cross-links and entanglements). The network is thought of as an
ensemble of meso-regions connected with each other by links (lamellar blocks).
In the sub-yield region of deformations, junctions between chains in
meso-domains slide with respect to their reference positions (which reflects
sliding of nodes in the amorphous phase and fine slip of lamellar blocks).
Above the yield point, sliding of nodes is accompanied by displacements of
meso-domains in the ensemble with respect to each other (which reflects coarse
slip and fragmentation of lamellar blocks).
  Stress-strain relations for a semicrystalline polymer are derived by using
the laws of thermodynamics. The constitutive equations are determined by 5
adjustable parameters that are found by matching observations. Fair agreement
is demonstrated between the experimental data and the results of numerical
simulation.

observables involving these interactions. As an application we analyze the full
one-loop electroweak radiative corrections to the partial decay widths
\Gamma(\tilde{f} -> f\neut) and \Gamma(\tilde{f} -> f'\cplus) for all sfermion
flavours and generations. These are combined with the QCD corrections to
compute the corrected branching ratios of sfermions. It turns out that the
electroweak corrections can have an important impact on the partial decay
widths, as well as the branching ratios, in wide regions of the parameter
space. The precise value of the corrections is strongly dependent on the
correlation between the different particle masses.

becomes small compared with the string scale, where a tachyon develops
triggering the recombination of the branes. We study this recombination due to
tachyon instabilities and we find the possibility for the final configuration
to be again branes intersecting at two angles. This preserves the interesting
features that are present in the intersecting brane models from the string
model building point of view also after the end of inflation. This fact was not

in terms of one- and two-pion exchange and local short distance operators,
which depend explicitly and implicitly on the quark masses. The pion propagator
becomes Coulomb-like in the chiral limit and thus one has significant
scattering in all partial waves. The pion-nucleon coupling depends implicitly
on the quark masses and we find that it becomes stronger in the chiral limit.
There is a further quark mass dependence in the S-wave four--nucleon couplings,
which can be estimated by means of dimensional analysis. We find that nuclear
physics in the chiral limit becomes natural. There are no new bound states, the
deuteron binding energy is B_D^{CL} = 9.6 +/- 1.9^+1.8_-1.0 MeV, and the S-wave

that in the presence of dibaryons or nucleon resonances the maximal possible

E-cross-B drift turbulence is studied with computations in three dimensional
tokamak flux tube geometry. For a given set of background scales, the parameter
space can be covered by the plasma beta and drift wave collisionality. At large
enough plasma beta the turbulence breaks out into ideal ballooning modes and
saturates only by depleting the free energy in the background pressure
gradient. At high collisionality it finds a more gradual transition to
resistive ballooning. At moderate beta and collisionality it retains drift wave
character, qualitatively identical to simple two dimensional slab models. The
underlying cause is the nonlinear vorticity advection through which the self
sustained drift wave turbulence supersedes the linear instabilities, scattering
them apart before they can grow, imposing its own physical character on the
dynamics. This vorticity advection catalyses the gradient drive, while
saturation occurs solely through turbulent mixing of pressure disturbances.
This situation persists in the whole of tokamak edge parameter space. Both
simplified isothermal models and complete warm ion models are treated.

particular state given the initial state of the field and the outcome of a
later measurement on the atom. Although this is not simply the time reverse of
the usual predictive problem, we demonstrate in this paper that retrodictive
collapses and revivals also exist. We highlight the differences between
predictive and retrodictive evolutions and describe an interesting situation
where the prepared state is essentially unretrodictable.

  Electric Signal Propagation in Transmission Lines",,,"10.1238/Physica.Regular.068a00377",,"quant-ph",,"  It is shown that the transmission line technology can be suitably used for
simulating quantum mechanics. Using manageable and at the same time
non-expensive technology, several quantum mechanical problems can be simulated
for significant tutorial purposes. The electric signal envelope propagation
through the line is governed by a Schrodinger-like equation for a complex
function, representing the low-frequency component of the signal, In this
preliminary analysis, we consider two classical examples, i.e. the Frank-Condon
principle and the Ramsauer effect.

thermodynamics if the theory can be made reversible by adding certain bound
entangled states as a free resource during entanglement manipulation. Subject
to plausible assumptions, we prove that this is not the case in general, and
discuss the implications of this for the thermodynamics of entanglement.
