of binaries containing black holes and normal-star companions with a wide range
of masses. We first reexamine the standard formation scenario for close
black-hole binaries, where the spiral-in of the companion in the envelope of a
massive star causes the ejection of the envelope. We estimate the formation
rates for different companion masses and different assumptions about the
common-envelope structure and other model parameters. We find that black-hole
binaries with intermediate- and high-mass secondaries can form for a wide range
of assumptions, while black-hole binaries with low-mass secondaries can only
form with apparently unrealistic assumptions (in agreement with previous
studies). We then present detailed binary evolution sequences for black-hole
binaries with secondaries of 2 to 17 Msun and demonstrate that in these systems
the black hole can accrete appreciably even if accretion is Eddington limited
(up to 7 Msun for an initial black-hole mass of 10 Msun) and that the black
holes can be spun up significantly in the process. We discuss the implications
of these calculations for well-studied black-hole binaries (in particular GRS
1915+105), ultra-luminous X-ray sources and Cygnus X-1. Finally, we discuss how
some of the assumptions in the standard model could be relaxed to allow the
formation of low-mass, short-period black-hole binaries which appear to be very
abundant in Nature. (Abstract abridged)

  Implications on Weighing Supermassive Black Hole","22 pages, 3 eps figures, accepted to AJ",,"10.1086/342737",,"astro-ph",,"  Optically thin and geometrically thick accretion flows are known to be
responsible for the observed radio/X-ray luminosity relation of the X-ray
bright galactic nuclei. It has also been suggested that supermassive black hole
masses can be estimated from measurements of the core radio luminosity and the
X-ray luminosity by using the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model.
In this study we increase the number of data available by compiling the
radio/X-ray fluxes and the mass in published literatures, and compare the
observed ratio of the luminosities with predictions from various models of
optically thin accretion flows. Semi-analytically derived relations of the
luminosities are presented in cases of the standard ADAF model and modified
ADAF models, in which a truncation of inner parts of the flows and winds
causing a reduction of the infalling matter are included. We show that the
observed relation can be used indeed to estimate the supermassive black hole
mass, provided that properties of such accretion flows are known. Having
investigated sensitivities of the method on modifications of the 'standard'
ADAF model, we find that a general trend of model predictions from the
'standard' ADAF, the truncated ADAF and the 'windy' ADAF are somewhat
indistinguishable. We also find, however, that the extreme case of the windy
model is inconsistent with currently available observational data, unless
microphysics parameters are to be substantially changed. High resolution radio
observations, however, are required to avoid the contamination of non-disk
components, such as, a jet component, which, otherwise, results in the
over-estimated SMBH mass.

upon and supercedes the Taylor & Cordes (1993) model by exploiting new
observations and analysis methods. For lines of sight directed out of the
Galactic plane, the new model yields substantially larger values for pulsar
dispersion measures, except for directions dominated by the local hot bubble.
Unlike the TC93 model, the new model provides sufficient electrons to account
for the dispersion measures of the vast majority of known, Galactic pulsars.
The new model is described and exemplified using plots of astronomically useful
quantities on Galactic-coordinate grids. Software available on the Internet is
also described. Future observations and analysis techniques that will improve

reviewed. CSPNe represent the rapid transitional stage between the Asymptotic

by the internal stellar structure which, in turn, is determined by the duration
of the preceding AGB evolution and therefore by the AGB mass-loss history.

since many years. Convective overshoot appears to be a key ingredient to model
these objects. Various thermal-pulse scenarios with inclusion of overshoot are
discussed, leading to surface abundances in general agreement with those

the stream contributes as much to the overall system brightness as the

is occuring onto only one pole of the white dwarf. We find enhanced brightness
towards the accretion region from irradiation and interpret enhanced brightness
in the threading region, where the ballistic stream is redirected to follow the
magnetic field lines of the white dwarf, as magnetic heating from the

Changes in the stream eclipse profile over one orbital period indicate that the

  Giant Branch Stars","13 pages, 9 figures","Chaos 12 (2002) 332","10.1063/1.1478773",,"astro-ph nlin.CD",,"  When intermediate mass stars reach their last stages of evolution they show
pronounced oscillations. This phenomenon happens when these stars reach the
so-called Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), which is a region of the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram located at about the same region of effective
temperatures but at larger luminosities than those of regular giant stars. The
period of these oscillations depends on the mass of the star. There is growing
evidence that these oscillations are highly correlated with mass loss and that,
as the mass loss increases, the pulsations become more chaotic. In this paper
we study a simple oscillator which accounts for the observed properties of this
kind of stars. This oscillator was first proposed and studied by Icke et al.
[Astron.Astrophys. 258, 341 (1992)] and we extend their study to the region of
more massive and luminous stars - the region of Super-AGB stars. The oscillator
consists of a periodic nonlinear perturbation of a linear Hamiltonian system.
The formalism of dynamical systems theory has been used to explore the
associated Poincare map for the range of parameters typical of those stars. We
have studied and characterized the dynamical behaviour of the oscillator as the
parameters of the model are varied, leading us to explore a sequence of local
and global bifurcations. Among these, a tripling bifurcation is remarkable,
which allows us to show that the Poincare map is a nontwist area preserving
map. Meandering curves, hierarchical-islands traps and sticky orbits also show
up. We discuss the implications of the stickiness phenomenon in the evolution
and stability of the Super-AGB stars.

both the Type-1 and Type-2 AGN populations, we obtain <Gamma>~2. The
progressive hardening of the mean X-ray source spectrum with decreasing flux is
essentially due to an increase in intrinsic absorption. The marked separation
between the two AGN populations in several diagnostics diagrams, involving
X-ray colour, X-ray flux, optical/near IR colour and optical brightness, is
also a consequence of different absorption column densities and enables the
classification of optically faint obscured AGN. About 27% of the subsample with

the emission intensity variations can be larger than the actual amplitude of

generally considered weak, as they depend on the spin-orbit couplings. In spin
systems with gapped ground states they can, however, have rather strong
effects. We will discuss recent results related to the results of neutron
scattering and ESR for $\rm SrCu_2(BO_3)_2$. Inclusion of the
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions can explain much of the dynamics of the
systems discussed, in particular the splitting and dispersion of the triplet
modes. Some effects remain to be explained, however. Symmetries of the crystal
lead to the prediction of zero intensity for transitions, for example between
the ground state and the triplets observed in ESR.
  We present recent calculations of the effects of anisotropic terms generated
dynamically, ie linearly in the phonon coordinates. We discuss how this leads
to a novel mechanism to explain the ESR intensities. For polarized neutron
scattering experiments, we can calculate the mixing of nuclear and magnetic
scattering amplitudes by such a term and how such mixing should be observed.

problem is equivalent to that of a pair of random walkers in the presence of
movable partial reflectors. The walkers, which are unbiased, start one lattice
spacing apart, and annihilate on their first contact. Each time one of the
walkers tries to visit a new site, it is reflected (with probability r) back to
its previous position, while the reflector is simultaneously pushed one step
away from the walker. Iteration of the discrete-time evolution equation for the

probabilities for all kinds of moves of the particles. We analyze the dynamics
for different values of the time $\tau$ during which the shaking is applied to
the system and for different intensities of the forces. It turns out that the
density evolution in time follows a stretched exponential behavior if $\tau$ is
not very large, while a power law tail develops for larger values of $\tau$.
Moreover, in the absence of friction, a critical value $\tau^*$ exists which
signals the crossover between two different regimes: for $\tau < \tau^*$ the
asymptotic density scales with a power law of $\tau$, while for $\tau > \tau^*$
it reaches logarithmically a maximal saturation value. Such behavior smears out
when a finite friction force is present. In this situation the dynamics is
slower and lower asymptotic densities are attained. In particular, for
significant friction forces, the final density decreases linearly with the
friction coefficient. We also compare the frictionless single tap dynamics to
the sequential tapping dynamics, observing in the latter case an inverse
logarithmic behavior of the density evolution, as found in the experiments.

ending with index j. The width of A(i,j) is w(i,j) = sum_{i <= k <= j} w_k, and
the density is (sum_{i<= k <= j} a_k)/ w(i,j). The maximum-density segment
problem takes A and two values L and U as input and asks for a segment of A
with the largest possible density among those of width at least L and at most
U. When U is unbounded, we provide a relatively simple, O(n)-time algorithm,
improving upon the O(n \log L)-time algorithm by Lin, Jiang and Chao. When both
L and U are specified, there are no previous nontrivial results. We solve the
problem in O(n) time if w_i=1 for all i, and more generally in
O(n+n\log(U-L+1)) time when w_i>=1 for all i.

innermost circular orbit (ICO) of irrotational and corotational binary
black-hole systems. We find that the post-Newtonian series converges well when
the two masses are comparable. We argue that the result for the ICO which is
predicted by the third post-Newtonian (3PN) approximation is likely to be very
close to the ``exact'' solution, within 1% of fractional accuracy or better.
The 3PN result is also in remarkable agreement with a numerical calculation of
the ICO in the case of two corotating black holes moving on exactly circular
orbits. The behaviour of the post-Newtonian series suggests that the
gravitational dynamics of two bodies of comparable masses does not resemble
that of a test particle on a Schwarzschild background. This leads us to
question the validity of some post-Newtonian resummation techniques that are
based on the idea that the field generated by two black holes is a deformation
of the Schwarzschild space-time.

deal with non-leptonic B decays, which play the main role in this review. After
a brief look at CP violation in the kaon system and a discussion of the rare
decays $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar{\nu}$ and $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar{\nu}$, we turn to the
formalism of $B^0_{d,s}$--$\bar{B^0_{d,s}}$ mixing, allowing us to explore
important $B$-factory benchmark modes and the $B_s$-meson system. We then focus
on charged B decays, $B\to\pi K$ modes and the phenomenology of $U$-spin
related B decays, including the $B_d\to\pi^+\pi^-$, $B_s\to K^+K^-$ system.
Finally, we discuss a particularly simple -- but very predictive -- scenario
for new physics, which is provided by models with ``minimal flavour
violation''. In this framework, various bounds can be derived and interesting
connections between the $B$ system and the rare kaon decays
$K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar{\nu}$ and $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar{\nu}$ arise.

external classic electric field with fixed frequency. The amplitude of the
external electric field is supposed to vary very slow in time. Garrison and
Wright [{\it Phys. Lett.} {\bf A128} (1988) 177] used the non-hermitian
Hamiltonian approach to study the adiabatic limit of this model and obtained
that the probability of this two-level system to be in its upper level has an
imaginary geometric phase. Using the master equation for describing the time
evolution of the two-level system we obtain that the imaginary phase due to
dissipative effects is time dependent, in opposition to Garrison and Wright
result. The present results show that the non-hermitian hamiltonian method
should not be used to discuss the nature of the imaginary phases in open
systems.
