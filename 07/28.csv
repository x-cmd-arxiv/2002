sources include LMC X-1, LMC X-3, GRS 1758-258, and Cyg X-1. Along with the
published results on 1E1740.7-2942, we have completed a high-resolution
spectroscopic survey of such systems. The observed X-ray spectra of LMC X-1 and
LMC X-3 show no prominent discrete features, while absorption edges (Mg K and
Si K) are detected in the spectrum of GRS 1758-258. The edges are likely to be
of interstellar origin. In most cases, the X-ray continuum can be described
well by models that are often adopted in low-resolution studies of black hole
candidates: a multi-temperature disk spectrum plus a Comptonization component.
However, the relative contribution of the two components varies greatly among
different sources. For instance, only the disk component is present for LMC X-1
and GRS 1758-258, while the Comptonized component is required for other
sources. We discuss general issues related to obtaining disk parameters from
modeling X-ray continuum.

suggest that CXOU J085201.4--461753 is similar to CXOU J232327.9+584842, the
central source of the supernova remnant Cas A. It could be either a neutron
star with a low or regular magnetic field, slowly accreting from a fossil disk,
or, more likely, an isolated neutron star with a superstrong magnetic field. In
either case, a conservative upper limit on surface temperature of a 10 km

the timescale distribution of the observed events, and find there are no
significant short events of a few days, in spite of our high detection
efficiency for short timescale events down to t_E = 0.3 days. We find that half

distance of 350 pc), an aspect ratio of 2.2 and morphologically resembles the
well known DG Tau optical micro-jet. The kinematical age of the jet (approx. 10
yr) coincides with the time since the last outburst from SVS 13. If we
interpret the observed H2 flux density with molecular shock models of 20-30
km/s, then the jet has a density as high as 1.e+5 cc. The presence of this
small jet warns that contamination by H2 emission from an outflow in studies
searching for H2 in circumstellar disks is possible. At the working surface,
the smooth H2 morphology of the HH 7 bowshock indicates that the magnetic field
is strong, playing a major role in stabilizing this structure. The H2 flux
density of the Mach disk, when compared with that of the bowshock, suggests
that its emission is produced by molecular shocks of less than 20 km/s. The

(i) it provides a clear and invariant definition of rest mass, without the

electric charge of test particles. With this interpretation, both the rest mass

the space-time split and the relative vectors are not relativistically correct,

D67 (2003) 025010","10.1103/PhysRevD.67.025010",,"hep-th quant-ph",,"  It is shown that the vacuum state of weakly interacting quantum field
theories can be described, in the Heisenberg picture, as a linear combination
of randomly distributed incoherent paths that obey classical equations of
motion with constrained initial conditions. We call such paths
""pseudoclassical"" paths and use them to define the dynamics of quantum
fluctuations. Every physical observable is assigned a time-dependent value on
each path in a way that respects the uncertainty principle, but in consequence,
some of the standard algebraic relations between quantum observables are not
necessarily fulfilled by their time-dependent values on paths. We define
""collective observables"" which depend on a large number of independent degrees
of freedom, and show that the dynamics of their quantum fluctuations can be
described in terms of unconstrained classical stochastic processes without
reference to any additional external system or to an environment. Our analysis
can be generalized to states other than the vacuum. Finally, we compare our
formalism to the formalism of coherent states, and highlight their differences.

pressure in avian coloniality. Different explanations have been proposed for
the existence of colonial breeding behavior in birds, but field studies offer
no conclusive results. We first propose a learning model in which the decision

the system are then studied according to a model in which birds choose
according to their individual experience, and the agreement of the introduction
of spatial structure with field data are then shown.

data from inclusive electron-deuteron scattering at large momentum transfer. We
calculate the asymptotic scaling function f(y) of the deuteron using its
relationship with the nucleon momentum distribution. The latter is obtained in
the framework of the relativistic light-front dynamics (LFD) method, in which
the deuteron is described by six invariant functions f_{i} (i=1,...,6) instead
of two (S and D waves) in the nonrelativistic case. Comparison of the LFD
asymptotic scaling function with other calculations using $S$ and $D$ waves
corresponding to various nucleon-nucleon potentials, as well as with the
Bethe-Salpeter result is made. It is shown that for |y|> 400 MeV/c the
differences between the LFD and the nonrelativistic scaling functions become
larger.

E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.66.031913",,"physics.bio-ph q-bio.GN",,"  By using the Jensen-Shannon divergence, genomic DNA can be divided into
compositionally distinct domains through a standard recursive segmentation
procedure. Each domain, while significantly different from its neighbours, may
however share compositional similarity with one or more distant
(non--neighbouring) domains. We thus obtain a coarse--grained description of
the given DNA string in terms of a smaller set of distinct domain labels. This
yields a minimal domain description of a given DNA sequence, significantly
reducing its organizational complexity. This procedure gives a new means of
evaluating genomic complexity as one examines organisms ranging from bacteria
to human. The mosaic organization of DNA sequences could have originated from
the insertion of fragments of one genome (the parasite) inside another (the
host), and we present numerical experiments that are suggestive of this
scenario.

ingredients of quantum information processing using coherent states. Recently,
numerous schemes to achieve this task have been proposed. In order to generate
travelling-wave entangled coherent states, cross phase modulation, optimized by
optical Kerr effect enhancement in a dense medium in an electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT) regime, seems to be very promising. In this
scenario, we propose a fully quantized model of a double-EIT scheme recently
proposed [D. Petrosyan and G. Kurizki, {\sl Phys. Rev. A} {\bf 65}, 33833
(2002)]: the quantization step is performed adopting a fully Hamiltonian
approach. This allows us to write effective equations of motion for two
interacting quantum fields of light that show how the dynamics of one field
depends on the photon-number operator of the other. The preparation of a
Schr\""odinger cat state, which is a superposition of two distinct coherent
states, is briefly exposed. This is based on non-linear interaction via
double-EIT of two light fields (initially prepared in coherent states) and on a
detection step performed using a $50:50$ beam splitter and two photodetectors.
In order to show the entanglement of a generated entangled coherent state, we
suggest to measure the joint quadrature variance of the field. We show that the
entangled coherent states satisfy the sufficient condition for entanglement
based on quadrature variance measurement. We also show how robust our scheme is
against a low detection efficiency of homodyne detectors.
