find that the mass function based method presented here can provide a very
accurate estimate of the linear power spectrum, particularly for low values of

longer or comparable to the nominal crossing time and thus evolve approximately
adiabatically. This is also true for massive embedded clusters (type III) for
which the velocity dispersion is larger than the sound speed of the ionised
gas. On expelling their residual gas, type I and III clusters are therefore
expected to lose a smaller fraction of their stellar component than type II

function of embedded clusters (ECMF), which is directly related to the mass
function of star-cluster-forming molecular cloud cores, to the ``initial'' MF
of bound gas-free star clusters (ICMF). The resulting ICMF has, for a

protostar which shows photospheric absorption features and demonstrates the
stellar nature of its central core. We find the spectrum of the luminous (L_bol
= 10 L_sun) protostellar source, YLW 15, to be stellar-like with numerous
atomic and molecular absorption features, indicative of a K5 IV/V spectral type
and a continuum veiling r_k = 3.0. Its derived stellar luminosity (3 L_sun) and
stellar radius (3.1 R_sun) are consistent with those of a 0.5 M_sun
pre-main-sequence star. However, 70% of its bolometric luminosity is due to
mass accretion, whose rate we estimate to be 1.6 E-6 M_sun / yr onto the
protostellar core. We determine that excess infrared emission produced by the
circumstellar accretion disk, the inner infalling envelope, and accretion
shocks at the surface of the stellar core of YLW 15 all contribute signifi-
cantly to its near-IR continuum veiling. Its projected rotation velocity v sin
i = 50 km / s is comparable to those of flat-spectrum protostars but
considerably higher than those of classical T Tauri stars in the rho Oph cloud.
The protostar may be magnetically coupled to its circumstellar disk at a radius
of 2 R_*. It is also plausible that this protostar can shed over half its
angular momentum and evolve into a more slowly rotating classical T Tauri star
by remaining coupled to its circumstellar disk (at increasing radius) as its
accretion rate drops by an order of magnitude during the rapid transition
between the Class I and Class II phases of evolution. The spectrum of WL 6 does
not show any photospheric absorption features, and we estimate that its
continuum veiling is r_k >= 4.6. Together with its low bolometric luminosity (2
L_sun), this dictates that its central core is very low mass, ~0.1 M_sun.

a simple parametric model of baryonic compression. The fraction of dark halo
lenses primarily contains information on the effect of baryonic compression and
the density profile of dark halos, and is expected to be insensitive to
cosmological parameters and source population. The model we adopt comprises the
galaxy formation probability p_g(M) which describes the global efficiency of
baryonic compression and the ratio of circular velocities of galaxies to virial
velocities of dark halos gamma_v=v_c/v_{vir} which means how the inner
structure of dark halos is modified due to baryonic compression. The model
parameters are constrained from the velocity function of galaxies and the
distribution of image separations in gravitational lensing, although the
degeneracy between model parameters still remains. We show that the fraction of
dark halo lenses depends strongly on gamma_v and the density profile of dark
halos such as inner slope alpha. This means that the observation of the
fraction of dark halos can break the degeneracy between model parameters if the
density profile of dark halo lenses is fully settled. On the other hand, by
restricting gamma_v to physically plausible range we can predict the lower
limit of the fraction of dark halo lenses on the basis of our model. Our result
indicates that steeper inner cusps of dark halos (alpha >~ 1.5) or too
centrally concentrated dark halos are inconsistent with the lack of dark halo
lenses in observations.

high X-ray emission measure and coronal density with a low rotational
modulation in X-rays. The technique is to extrapolate the coronal field from
the surface maps by assuming the field to be potential. We then determine the
coronal density for an isothermal corona by solving hydrostatic equilibrium
along each field line and scaling the plasma pressure at the loop footpoints
with the magnetic pressure. We set the density to zero along those field lines
that are open and those where at any point along their length the plasma
pressure exceeds the magnetic pressure. We then calculate the optically thin
X-ray emission measure and rotational modulation for models with a range of
coronal densities. Although the corona can be very extended, much of the
emission comes from high-latitude regions close to the stellar surface. Since
these are always in view as the star rotates, there is little rotational
modulation. We find that emission measures in the observed range of 10^52.8 -
10^53.3 per cubic centimetre can be reproduced with densities in the range 10^9

radiative processes related to nonthermal electrons are responsible for this
radiation, the sites and nature of particle acceleration are not known. We
investigate here the acceleration of protons and electrons in the shocks
originated during mergers of clusters of galaxies, where the Fermi acceleration
may work. We propose a semi-analytical model to evaluate the Mach number of the
shocks generated during clusters mergers and we use this procedure to determine
the spectrum of the accelerated particles for each one of the shocks produced
during the merger history of a cluster. We follow the proton component,
accumulated over cosmological time scales, and the short lived electron
component. We conclude that efficient particle acceleration, resulting in
nonthermal spectra that compare to observations, occurs mainly in minor
mergers, namely mergers between clusters with very different masses. Major
mergers, often invoked to be sites for the production of extended radio halos,
are found to have on average too weak shocks and are unlikely to result in
appreciable nonthermal activity.

retained rather simply within the ESSM extension. These include an
understanding of the smallness of V_{cb} ~ 0.04 and the largeness of nu_mu -
nu_tau oscillation angle, sin^2 2 theta_{nu_mu nu_tau}^{osc} ~ 1. We analyze
the new contributions arising through the exchange of the vectorlike families
of ESSM to radiative processes including tau -> mu gamma, mu -> e gamma, b -> s
gamma, EDM of the muon and the muon (g-2). We show that ESSM makes significant
contributions especially to the decays tau -> mu gamma and mu -> e gamma and
simultaneously to muon (g-2). For a large and plausible range of relevant
parameters, we obtain: a_mu^{ESSM} ~ +(10-40) times 10^{-10}, with a correlated
prediction that tau -> mu gamma should be discovered with an improvement in its
current limit by a factor of 3-20. The implications for mu -> e gamma are very
similar. The muon EDM is within reach of the next generation experiments. Thus,
ESSM with heavy leptons being lighter than about 700 GeV (say) can be probed
effectively by radiative processes before a direct search for these vectorlike

significant primordial non-Gaussianities in the adiabatic mode while preserving
the scale invariance of the power spectrum. This mechanism is based on the
generation of non-Gaussian isocurvature fluctuations which are then transfered
to the adiabatic modes through a bend in the classical inflaton trajectory.
Natural realizations involve quartic self-interaction terms for which a full
computation can be performed. The expected statistical properties of the
resulting metric fluctuations are shown to be the superposition of a Gaussian
and a non-Gaussian contribution of the same variance. The relative weight of
these two contributions is related to the total bending in field space. We
explicit the non-Gaussian probability distribution function which appears to be
described by a single new parameter. Only two new parameters therefore suffice
in describing the non-Gaussianity.

stars may cool rapidly, perhaps by the direct URCA process which requires a
high proton fraction. The proton fraction is determined by the nuclear symmetry
energy whose density dependence may be constrained by measuring the neutron
radius of a heavy nucleus, such as 208Pb. Such a measurement is necessary for a
reliable extrapolation of the proton fraction to the higher densities present
in the neutron star. A large neutron radius in 208Pb implies a stiff symmetry
energy that grows rapidly with density, thereby favoring a high proton fraction
and allowing direct URCA cooling. Predictions for the neutron radius in 208Pb
are correlated to the proton fraction in dense matter by using a variety of
relativistic effective field-theory models. Models that predict a neutron (Rn)
minus proton (Rp) root-mean-square radius in 208Pb to be Rn-Rp<0.20 fm have
proton fractions too small to allow the direct URCA cooling of 1.4 solar-mass
neutron stars. Conversely, if Rn-Rp>0.25 fm, the direct URCA process is allowed
(by all models) to cool down a 1.4 solar-mass neutron star. The Parity Radius
Experiment at Jefferson Laboratory aims to measure the neutron radius in 208Pb
accurately and model independently via parity-violating electron scattering.
Such a measurement would greatly enhance our ability to either confirm or
dismiss the direct URCA cooling of neutron stars.

pseudospin degeneracy arises from a significant cancellation among the
different terms in that equation. This is a manifestation of the dynamical
character of this symmetry in the nucleus. We analyze the isospin dependence of
the pseudospin symmetry in a nuclear isotope chain by including a
vector-isovector potential V_rho and a Coulomb potential and conclude that
V_rho gives the main contribution to the observed pseudospin isospin asymmetry.

up to sqrt(s) = 2 GeV. In this analysis we find strong evidence for the
resonances P_{31}(1750), P_{13}(1900), P_{33}(1920), and D_{13}(1950). The
omega N production mechanism is dominated by large P_{11}(1710) and
P_{13}(1900) contributions. In this second part we present the results on the
photoproduction reactions and the electromagnetic properties of the resonances.
The inclusion of all important final states up to sqrt(s) = 2 GeV allows for
estimates on the importance of the individual states for the GDH sum rule.

The transverse part of the vector potential belongs to magnetism, the
longitudinal one is concerned with gravitation. The Coulomb gauge indicates
that longitudinal components of the fields propagate instantaneously. The
delta-function singularity of the field of the divergence of the vector
potential, referred to as the dilatation center, represents an elementary agent
of gravitation. Viewing a particle as a source or a scattering center of the
point dilatation, the Newton's gravitation law can be reproduced.

after nuclear fission was discovered, to ascertain the feasibility of a nuclear

Szilard believed a nuclear bomb could be built, and that the Germans may be
doing so, but Fermi was sceptical. The Anglo-American project to build a bomb
began late in 1941 after Oliphant brought the Frisch-Peierls memorandum to the
attention of U. S. physicists. Szilard recalled ""On matters scientific or
technical there was rarely any disagreement[but] Fermi and I disagreed from the
very start of our collaboration about every issue that involved not science but
principles of action in the face of the approaching war. If the nation owes us
gratitude - and it may not - it does so for having stuck it out together as
long as was necessary."" As the war with Germany was drawing to a close and the
successful construction of the atomic bombs was well underway, these two men
took opposing positions regarding use of the bombs.

temporal evolution of error statistics by integration of the Fokker-Planck
Equation. Phase space advection and diffusion are obtained from histogram
techniques considering the model as a black box. For efficiency, the estimate
combines nudging and Kalman Filtering. The ocean state is estimated for the El
Nino year 1997 by dynamical extrapolation of observed sea-surface temperatures
and TAO/Triton subsurface temperatures. The model-data combination yields
improved estimates of the ocean's mean state and a realistic record of El Nino
related variability. The assimilator proves as an efficient, viable and thus
practical approach to operational global ocean state estimation.
