function (LF) of AGN implied by several observationally-motivated models of the
ionizing background. Our results depend crucially on whether we use the total
ionizing rate measured by the proximity effect technique or the lower
determination from the flux decrement distribution of Ly alpha forest lines.
Assuming a faint-end LF slope of 1.58 and the SDSS estimates of the bright-end
slope and normalization, we find that the LF must break at M_B*=-24.2,-22.3,
-20.8 at z=3,4, 5 if we adopt the lower ionization rate and assume no stellar
contribution to the background. The break must occur at M_B*=-20.6,-18.7, -18.7
for the proximity effect background estimate. These values brighten by as much
as ~2 mag if high-z galaxies contribute to the background with an escape
fraction of ionizing photons consistent with recent estimates: f_e=0.16. By
comparing to faint AGN searches, we find that the typically-quoted proximity
effect estimates of the background imply an over-abundance of faint AGN (even
with f_e=1). Even adopting the lower bound on proximity effect measurements,
the stellar escape fraction must be high: f_e>0.2. Conversely, the lower flux-
decrement-derived background requires a limited stellar contribution: f_e<0.05.
Our derived LFs together with the locally-estimated black hole density suggest
that the efficiency of converting mass to light in optically-unobscured AGN is
somewhat lower than expected, <0.05. Comparison with similar estimates based on
X-ray counts suggests that more than half of all AGN are obscured in the
UV/optical. We also derive lower limits on typical AGN lifetimes and obtain
>10^7 yrs for favored cases.

molecular cloud has significant implications for understanding low-mass star
formation in relatively quiescent conditions. The large scale and regular
spacing of the filaments suggests that small-scale turbulence is of limited
importance, which could be consistent with driving on large scales by flows
which produced the cloud. The small spatial dispersion of stars from gaseous
filaments indicates that the low-mass stars are generally born with small
velocity dispersions relative to their natal gas, of order the sound speed or
less. The spatial distribution of the stars exhibits a mean separation of about
0.25 pc, comparable to the estimated Jeans length in the densest gaseous
filaments, and is consistent with roughly uniform density along the filaments.
The efficiency of star formation in filaments is much higher than elsewhere,
with an associated higher frequency of protostars and accreting T Tauri stars.
The protostellar cores generally are aligned with the filaments, suggesting
that they are produced by gravitational fragmentation, resulting in initially
quasi-prolate cores. Given the absence of massive stars which could strongly
dominate cloud dynamics, Taurus provides important tests of theories of
dispersed low-mass star formation and numerical simulations of molecular cloud
structure and evolution.

by the BATSE instrument and in soft X-rays (SXR) by GOES, we studied several
aspects of the Neupert effect and its interpretation in the frame of the
electron-beam-driven evaporation model. In particular, we investigated the time
differences ($\Delta t$) between the maximum of the SXR emission and the end of
the HXR emission, which are expected to occur at almost the same time.
Furthermore, we performed a detailed analysis of the SXR peak flux -- HXR
fluence relationship for the complete set of events, as well as separately for
subsets of events which are likely compatible/incompatibe with the timing
expectations of the Neupert effect. The distribution of the time differences
reveals a pronounced peak at $\Delta t = 0$. About half of the events show a
timing behavior which can be considered to be consistent with the expectations
from the Neupert effect. For these events, a high correlation between the SXR
peak flux and the HXR fluence is obtained, indicative of electron-beam-driven
evaporation. However, there is also a significant fraction of flares (about one
fourth), which show strong deviations from $\Delta t = 0$, with a prolonged
increase of the SXR emission distinctly beyond the end of the HXR emission.
These results suggest that electron-beam-driven evaporation plays an important
role in solar flares. Yet, in a significant fraction of events, there is also
clear evidence for the presence of an additional energy transport mechanism
other than the nonthermal electron beams, where the relative contribution is
found to vary with the flare importance.

undergoing state changes. Evidence for a second, yet unknown, parameter
controlling the hard X-ray emission is emerging. We draw a parallel with the

neutrino oscillation experiments has become compelling, but leaves the overall
neutrino mass scale m_nu undetermined. The most restrictive limit of m_nu < 0.8
eV arises from the 2dF galaxy redshift survey in conjunction with the standard
theory of cosmological structure formation. A relation between the hot dark
matter fraction and m_nu depends on the cosmic number density n_nu of
neutrinos. If solar neutrino oscillations indeed correspond to the favored
large mixing angle MSW solution, then big-bang nucleosynthesis gives us a
restrictive limit on all neutrino chemical potentials, removing the previous
uncertainty of n_nu. Therefore, a possible future measurement of m_nu will
directly establish the cosmic neutrino mass fraction Omega_nu. Cosmological
neutrinos with sub-eV masses can play an interesting role for producing the
highest-energy cosmic rays (Z-burst scenario). Sub-eV masses also relate
naturally to leptogenesis scenarios of the cosmic baryon asymmetry.
Unfortunately, the time-of-flight dispersion of a galactic or local-group
supernova neutrino burst is not sensitive in the sub-eV range.

within a low surface brightness red envelope that is substantially thicker than
the thin disk (a/b~4:1 vs a/b>8:1), extends to at least 5 vertical disk scale
heights above the galaxy midplane, and has a radial scale length that appears
to be uncorrelated with that of the embedded thin disk. The color of the red
envelope is similar from galaxy to galaxy and is consistent with a relatively
old (>6Gyr) stellar population that is not particularly metal-poor. The color
difference between the thin disk and the envelope varies systematically with
rotation speed, indicating a younger thin disk relative to the red envelope in
lower mass galaxies. The red stellar envelopes are similar to the MW thick
disk, having common surface brightnesses, spatial distributions, mean ages, and
metallicities. The ubiquity of the red stellar envelopes implies that the
formation of the thick disk is a nearly universal feature of disk formation and
need not be associated with bulge formation. Furthermore, our data suggest that
the thick disk forms early, even in cases where the majority of star formation
was recent. Finally, we find that our data and the observed properties of the
MW thick disk argue in favor of a merger origin for the thick disk population.
If so, then the age of the thick disk marks the end of the epoch of major
merging, and the age difference between the thin and thick disks can become a
strong constraint on cosmological constants and models of galaxy and/or
structure formation.

to use the radio emission as a useful diagnostic tool for cosmic ray research.
A new generation of digital telescopes will make it possible to study this
radio emission in greater detail. For example, the planned Low-Frequency Array

study extensive air showers and even detect neutrino-induced showers on the

applicable to other future digital radio telescopes such as the
Square-Kilometer-Array (SKA). LOFAR will be capable of detecting air-shower
radio emission from >2*10^14 eV to ~10^20 eV. The technique could be easily
extended to include air shower arrays consisting of particle detectors
(KASCADE, Auger), thus providing crucial additional information for obtaining
energy and chemical composition of cosmic rays. It also has the potential to
extend the cosmic ray search well beyond an energy of 10^21 eV if isotropic
radio signatures can be found. Other issues that LOFAR can address are to
determine the neutral component of the cosmic ray spectrum, possibly look for
neutron bursts, and do actual cosmic ray astronomy.

small-mass scales of progenitors at high redshifts. One can reproduce the
Press-Schechter prediction to a reasonable degree by adopting a fairly large
number of redshift bins, N_{step} ~ 1000 in generating merger trees, which is a
factor of ten larger than the canonical value used in previous literature.

1) The duration, rise and decay times increase with increasing importance
class. The increase is more pronounced for the decay times than for the rise
times. The same relation is valid with regard to the brightness classes but in
a weaker manner. 2) The event asymmetry indices, which characterize the
proportion of the decay to the rise time of an event, are predominantly
positive (90%). For about 50% of the events the decay time is even more than 4
times as long as the rise time. 3) The event asymmetries increase with the
importance class. 4) The flare duration and decay times vary in phase with the
solar cycle; the rise times do not. 5) The event asymmetries do not reveal a
distinct correlation with the solar cycle. However, they drop during times of
solar minima, which can be explained by the shorter decay times found during
minimum activity. 6) There exists a significant N-S asymmetry over longer
periods, and the dominance of one hemisphere over the other can persist for
more than one cycle. 7) For certain cycles there may be evidence that the N-S

are driven by an oscillating field exhibit a nonequilibrium dynamic phase
transition (DPT). The DPT occurs when the field frequency is on the order of
the inverse of an intrinsic lifetime associated with the transitions between
the two stable states in a static field of the same magnitude as the amplitude
of the oscillating field. The DPT is continuous and belongs to the same
universality class as the equilibrium phase transition of the Ising model in
zero field [G. Korniss et al., Phys. Rev. E 63, 016120 (2001); H. Fujisaka et
al., Phys. Rev. E 63, 036109 (2001)]. However, it has previously been claimed
that the DPT becomes discontinuous at temperatures below a tricritical point
[M. Acharyya, Phys. Rev. E 59, 218 (1999)]. This claim was based on
observations in dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a multipeaked probability
density for the dynamic order parameter and negative values of the fourth-order
cumulant ratio. Both phenomena can be characteristic of discontinuous phase
transitions. Here we use classical nucleation theory for the decay of
metastable phases, together with data from large-scale dynamic Monte Carlo
simulations of a two-dimensional kinetic Ising ferromagnet, to show that these
observations in this case are merely finite-size effects. For sufficiently
small systems and low temperatures, the continuous DPT is replaced, not by a
discontinuous phase transition, but by a crossover to stochastic resonance. In
the infinite-system limit the stochastic-resonance regime vanishes, and the
continuous DPT should persist for all nonzero temperatures.

the system for a native state is controlled by a ""selection temperature"" T0. In
the limit of high T0, the model reduces to a random heteropolymer, while for
T0-->0 the system is forced into the native state. Within the Gaussian
variational approach that we employed previously for the random heteropolymer,
we explore the phases of the system for large and small T0. For large T0, the
system exhibits a (dynamical) spin glass phase, like that found for the random
heteropolymer, below a temperature Tg. For small T0, we find an ordered phase,
characterized by a nonzero overlap with the native state, below a temperature
Tn \propto 1/T0 > Tg. However, the random-globule phase remains locally stable
below Tn, down to the dynamical glass transition at Tg. Thus, in this model,
folding is rapid for temperatures between Tg and Tn, but below Tg the system
can get trapped in conformations uncorrelated with the native state. At a lower
temperature, the ordered phase can also undergo a dynamical glass transition,
splitting into substates separated by large barriers.

dynamics of the condensate squeezes and amplifies the quantum excitations,
mixing the positive and negative frequency components of their wave functions
thereby creating particles which appear as bursts and jets. By analyzing the
changing amplitude and particle content of these excitations, our simple
physical picture (based on a test field approximation) explains well the
overall features of the Bose Novae phenomena and provide excellent quantitative
fits with experimental data on several aspects, such as the scaling behavior of
the collapse time and the amount of particles in the jet. The predictions of
the bursts at this level of approximation is less than satisfactory but may be
improved on by including the backreaction of the excitations on the condensate.
The mechanism behind the dominant effect -- parametric amplification of vacuum
fluctuations and freezing of modes outside of horizon -- is similar to that of
cosmological particle creation and structure formation in a rapid quench (which
is fundamentally different from Hawking radiation in black holes). This shows
that BEC dynamics is a promising venue for doing `laboratory cosmology'.

are employed to approximate the inhomogeneous terms via the DRM, while
non-singular general solution leads to a boundary-only RBF formulation for
homogenous solution. The present scheme is named as the boundary knot method
(BKM) to differentiate it from the other numerical techniques. In particular,
due to the use of nonsingular general solutions rather than singular
fundamental solutions, the BKM is different from the method of fundamental
solution in that the former does no require the artificial boundary and results
in the symmetric system equations under certain conditions. The efficiency and
utility of this new technique are validated through a number of typical
numerical examples. Completeness concern of the BKM due to the only use of
non-singular part of complete fundamental solution is also discussed.

generalise this interpretation to an arbitrarily moving observer. In the

The observer-dependent particle interpretation generalises Gibbons' definition
to non-stationary spacetimes. This allows any observer to be considered,
providing a particle interpretation that depends {\it only} on the observer's
motion and the background, not on any choice of coordinates or gauge, or on
details of their particle detector. Consistency with known results is
demonstrated for the cases of Rindler space and deSitter space. Radar time is
also considered for an arbitrarily moving observer in an arbitrary 1+1

their fluctuations are also discussed, allowing one to say with definable

(NJL) model in the study of matter at high density. There is a good deal of
interest in the predictions of diquark condensation and color
superconductivity, with suggested applications to the study the properties of
neutron stars. As the researchers in this field note, the NJL model does not
describe confinement, so that one is limited to the study of the deconfined
phase, which may set in at several times nuclear matter density. Recently, we
have extended the NJL model to include a covariant confinement model. In the
present work our goal is to include a phenomenological model of deconfinement
at finite matter density, using some analogy to what is known concerning
""string breaking"" and deconfinement at finite temperature. Various models may
be used, but for this work we choose a specific model for the density
dependence of the parameters of our confining interaction. We perform
relativistic random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculations of the properties of
the $\pi(138), K(495), f_0(980), a_0(980)$ and $K_0^*(1430)$ mesons and their
radial excitations. In the model chosen for this work, there are no mesonic
states beyond about $2\rho_{NM}$, where $\rho_{NM}$ is the density of nuclear
matter. This inability of the model to support hadronic excitations at large
values of the density is taken as a signal of deconfinement. In addition to the
density dependence of the confining interaction, we use the density-dependent
quark mass values obtained in either the SU(2) or SU(3)-flavor versions of the
NJL model.

anharmonic oscillations with a nontrivial frequency--amplitude relation. When

grow in amplitude without a bound. Open string field theory resembles this

ensue. We discuss the significance of these results for the issues of emerging

vertices are given by the elements of the set. A particular class of digraphs
are Cayley graphs, also known as group lattices. They are determined by a
discrete group G and a finite subset S. There is a distinguished subclass of
""bicovariant"" Cayley graphs with the property that ad(S)S is contained in S.
  We explore the properties of differential calculi which arise from Cayley
graphs via the above correspondence. The first order calculi extend to higher
orders and then allow to introduce further differential geometric structures.
  Furthermore, we explore the properties of ""discrete"" vector fields which
describe deterministic flows on group lattices. A Lie derivative with respect
to a discrete vector field and an inner product with forms is defined. The
Lie-Cartan identity then holds on all forms for a certain subclass of discrete
vector fields.
  We develop elements of gauge theory and construct an analogue of the lattice
gauge theory (Yang-Mills) action on an arbitrary group lattice. Also linear
connections are considered and a simple geometric interpretation of the torsion
is established.
  By taking a quotient with respect to some subgroup of the discrete group,
generalized differential calculi associated with so-called Schreier diagrams

events with different kind of fine structures, recorded at the Trieste
Astronomical Observatory. The signature of such types of solar radio events is
highly structured in time. However, periodicities are rather seldom, and linear
mode theory can provide only limited interpretation of the data. Therefore, we
performed an analysis based on methods of the nonlinear dynamics theory.
Additionally to the commonly used correlation dimension, we also calculated
local pointwise dimensions. This alternative approach is motivated by the fact
that astrophysical time series represent real-world systems, which cannot be
kept in a controlled state and which are highly interconnected with their
surroundings. In such systems pure determinism is rather unlikely to be
realized, and therefore a characterization by invariants of the dynamics might
probably be inadequate. In fact, the outcome of the dimension analysis does not
give hints for low-dimensional determinism in the data, but we show that,
contrary to the correlation dimension method, local dimension estimations can
give physical insight into the events even in cases in which pure determinism
cannot be established. In particular, in most of the analyzed radio events
nonlinearity in the data is detected, and the local dimension analysis provides
a basis for a quantitative description of the time series, which can be used to
characterize the complexity of the related physical system in a comparative and
non-invariant manner.
