in this metallicity range, tempting one to deduce from these observations a
primordial value for the He3 abundance, which could join D and Li7 as an
indicator of the cosmic baryon density. However, using the same data, we show
that it is not possible to obtain a strong constraint on the baryon density
range. This is due to (i) the intrinsically weak sensitivity of the primordial
He3 abundance to the baryon density; (ii) the limited range in metallicity of
the sample; (iii) the intrinsic scatter in the data; and (iv) our limited
understanding of the chemical and stellar evolution of this isotope.
Consequently, the He3 observations correspond to an extended range of
baryon-to-photon ratio, eta = (2.2 - 6.5) x 10^{-10}, which diminishes the role
of He3 as a precision baryometer. On the other hand, once the baryon-to-photon
ratio is determined by the CMB, D/H, or Li7/H, the primordial value of He3/H
can be inferred. Henceforth new observations of Galactic He3, can in principle
greatly improve our understanding of stellar and/or chemical evolution and
reconcile the observations of the HII regions and those of the planetary

Helium in an ultra-strong (~1.5x10^{14} G) magnetic field. We have applied our
recently developed atomic model (Mori & Hailey 2002) for strongly-magnetized
neutron star atmospheres to this problem. We find that this model, along with

gamma-ray OSSE detector on board CGRO simultaneous with either Ginga or RXTE
observations. The source was bright during four of them, with the luminosity of
L ~ 10^{37} erg/s and the spectrum typical for hard states of accreting black
holes, and it was in an off state during the fifth one, with L ~ 10^{35} erg/s.
Our broad-band spectral fits show the mean electron energy of electrons in the
Comptonizing plasma decreasing with increasing luminosity within the hard
(bright) state. For the observation with the best statistics at soft
gamma-rays, approximately 1/4 of energy in the Comptonizing plasma is probably
carried by non-thermal electrons. Then, considering the efficiency of
Comptonized hybrid synchrotron emission allows us to obtain an upper limit on
the strength of the magnetic field in the X-ray source. Furthermore, this
synchrotron emission is capable of producing the optical spectrum observed in
an optically-high state of GX 339-4. In the off state, the hard X-ray spectrum
is consistent with being dominated by bremsstrahlung. The unusually strong Fe K
alpha line observed by the PCA during that state is found not to be intrinsic
to the source but to originate mostly in the Galactic diffuse emission.

information filtering and extraction to reduce the volume of data presented to
the user. They are also used to keep track of user profiles and formulate
policies to improve and automate decision making.
  We propose here a simple, logical framework for formulating preferences as
preference formulas. The framework does not impose any restrictions on the
preference relations and allows arbitrary operation and predicate signatures in
preference formulas. It also makes the composition of preference relations
straightforward. We propose a simple, natural embedding of preference formulas
into relational algebra (and SQL) through a single winnow operator
parameterized by a preference formula. The embedding makes possible the
formulation of complex preference queries, e.g., involving aggregation, by
piggybacking on existing SQL constructs. It also leads in a natural way to the
definition of further, preference-related concepts like ranking. Finally, we
present general algebraic laws governing the winnow operator and its
interaction with other relational algebra operators. The preconditions on the
applicability of the laws are captured by logical formulas. The laws provide a
formal foundation for the algebraic optimization of preference queries. We
demonstrate the usefulness of our approach through numerous examples.

original database to every of its minimal repairs, the approach is based on a
specification of database repairs using disjunctive logic programs with
exceptions, whose answer set semantics can be represented and computed by

Lorentzian manifolds called {\em causal relation}, which is any diffeomorphism
characterized by mapping every causal vector of the first manifold onto a
causal vector of the second. We perform a thorough study of the mathematical
properties of causal relations and prove in particular that two given
Lorentzian manifolds (say $V$ and $W$) may be causally related only in one
direction (say from $V$ to $W$, but not from $W$ to $V$). This leads us to the
concept of causally equivalent (or {\em isocausal} in short) Lorentzian
manifolds as those mutually causally related. This concept is more general and
of a more basic nature than the conformal relationship, because we prove the
remarkable result that a conformal relation $\f$ is characterized by the fact
of being a causal relation of the {\em particular} kind in which both $\f$ and
$\f^{-1}$ are causal relations. For isocausal Lorentzian manifolds there are
one-to-one correspondences, which sometimes are non-trivial, between several
classes of their respective future (and past) objects. A more important feature
of isocausal Lorentzian manifolds is that they satisfy the same causality
constraints. This indicates that the causal equivalence provides a possible
characterization of the {\it basic causal structure}, in the sense of mutual
causal compatibility, for Lorentzian manifolds. Thus, we introduce a partial
order for the equivalence classes of isocausal Lorentzian manifolds providing a
classification of spacetimes in terms of their causal properties, and a
classification of all the causal structures that a given fixed manifold can
have. A full abstract inside the paper.

signature of physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, supersymmetric

upcoming experiments. In this paper we analyze the possibility to observe Z -->
lep_I lep_J in the GigaZ option of TESLA at DESY. We show that although models
with SUSY masses above the current limits could predict a branching ratio BR(Z
--> mu e) accessible to the experiment, they would imply an unobserved rate of
mu --> e gamma and thus are excluded. In models with a small mixing angle
between the first and the third (or the second and the third) slepton families
GigaZ could observe Z --> tau mu (or Z --> tau e) consistently with present
bounds on lep_J --> lep_I gamma. In contrast, if the mixing angles between the
three slepton families are large the bounds from mu --> e gamma push these
processes below the reach of GigaZ. We show that in this case the masses of the
three slepton families must be strongly degenerated (with mass differences of
order 10^{-3}). We update the limits on the slepton mass insertions
delta_{LL,RR,LR} and discuss the correlation between flavor changing and g_mu-2

years by Manetti, by Kharlamov-Kulikov and in my cited article. For the latter
much simpler examples, it was shown that there are surfaces $S$ which are not
deformation equivalent to their complex conjugate. However, by Seiberg-Witten
theory, any (oriented) diffeomorphism of minimal surfaces carries the canonical
class K to + K or to - K, and deformation equivalence implies the existence of
a diffeomorphism carrying K to +K. In fact, as observed by a referee, the bulk
of the proof was to show that our surfaces have no selfhomeomorphism carrying K
to - K (the same for the K-K surfaces). In this note we show that Manetti's
surfaces provide indeed a counterexample to the reinforced conjecture, since
they are symplectomorphic. Our result is that a surface of general type has a
canonical symplectic structure (up to symplectomorphism) which is invariant for
deformation and for certain degenerations to normal surfaces. Since moreover no
simply connected counterexamples to the conjecture are known, we provide
explicit families of 1-connected surfaces, which are obtained by glueing
together two fixed manifolds with boundary, are not deformation equivalent, but
are homeomorphic under a homeomorphism carrying K to +K. We also give as
application the existence of symplectically equivalent, but not deformation
equivalent cuspidal plane curves.

turbulent boundary layers, manifest a substantial increase of intermittency
with respect to isotropic conditions. This suggests a close link between
anisotropy and intermittency. However, a rigorous statistical description of
anisotropic flows is, in most cases, hampered by the inhomogeneity of the
field. This difficulty is absent for the homogeneous shear flow. For this flow
the scale by scale budget is discussed here by using the appropriate form of
the Karman-Howarth equation, to determine the range of scales where the shear
is dominant. The issuing generalization of the four-fifths law is then used as
the guideline to extend to shear dominated flows the Kolmogorov-Obhukhov theory
of intermittency. The procedure leads naturally to the formulation of
generalized structure functions and the description of intermittency thus
obtained reduces to the K62 theory for vanishing shear. Also here the
intermittency corrections to the scaling exponents are carried by the moments
of the coarse grained energy dissipation field. Numerical experiments give
indications that the dissipation field is statistically unaffected by the
shear, thereby supporting the conjecture that the intermittency corrections are
universal. This observation together with the present reformulation of the
theory gives reason for the increased intermittency observed in the classical
longitudinal velocity increments.

simultaneity harmoniously co-exist.

averaging of momentum of inertia of molecules during the vibration motion of
atoms. Rough estimates of the widths of clumps of lines in absorption spectra
of some acetylenic derivatives were made with this model. Obtained results are
in a satisfactory agreement with the available experimental data. This idea
allows also in principle to explain the origin of intensive wings of lines, the
existence of which was discussed earlier.

with respect to the group of local transformations. What aspects of the study
of entanglement are applicable to generalized coherent states? Conversely, what
can be learned about entanglement from the well-studied theory of coherent
states? With these questions in mind, we characterize unentangled pure states
as extremal states when considered as linear functionals on the local Lie
algebra. As a result, a relativized notion of purity emerges, showing that
there is a close relationship between purity, coherence and (non-)entanglement.
To a large extent, these concepts can be defined and studied in the even more
general setting of convex cones of states. Based on the idea that entanglement
is relative, we suggest considering these notions in the context of partially
ordered families of Lie algebras or convex cones, such as those that arise
naturally for multipartite systems. The study of entanglement includes notions
of local operations and, for information-theoretic purposes, entanglement
measures and ways of scaling systems to enable asymptotic developments. We
propose ways in which these may be generalized to the Lie-algebraic setting,
and to a lesser extent to the convex-cones setting. One of our original
motivations for this program is to understand the role of entanglement-like
concepts in condensed matter. We discuss how our work provides tools for
analyzing the correlations involved in quantum phase transitions and other
aspects of condensed-matter systems.
