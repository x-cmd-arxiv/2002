emission thought to arise at the inner edge of circumstellar disks around young
stellar objects (YSOs). We argue that the near-infrared sizes being measured
are closely related to the radius at which dust is sublimated by the stellar
radiation field. We consider how realistic dust optical properties and gas
opacity dramatically affect the predicted location of this dust destruction
radius, an exercise routinely done in other contexts but so far neglected in
the analysis of near-infrared sizes of YSOs. We also present the accumulated
literature of near-infrared YSO sizes in the form of a ``size-luminosity
diagram'' and compare with theoretical expectations. We find evidence that
large (>~ 1 micron) dust grains predominate in the inner disks of T Tauri and
Herbig Ae/Be stars, under the assumption that the inner-most gaseous disks are
optically-thin at visible wavelengths.

1989 to 2002 at Lick Observatory. The velocities reveal evidence for an outer
planetary companion to 55 Cancri orbiting at 5.5 AU. The velocities also
confirm a second, inner planet at 0.11 AU. The outer planet is the first
extrasolar planet found that orbits near or beyond the orbit of Jupiter. It was
drawn from a sample of ~50 stars observed with sufficient duration and quality
to detect a giant planet at 5 AU, implying that such planets are not rare. The
properties of this jupiter analog may be compared directly to those of the
Jovian planets in our Solar System. Its eccentricity is modest, e=0.16,
compared with e=0.05 for both Jupiter and Saturn. Its mass is at least 4.0
jupiter masses (M sin i). The two planets do not perturb each other
significantly. Moreover, a third planet of sub-Jupiter mass could easily
survive in between these two known planets. Indeed a third periodicity remains
in the velocity measurements with P = 44.3 d and a semi-amplitude of 13 m/s.
This periodicity is caused either by a third planet at a=0.24 AU or by
inhomogeneities on the stellar surface that rotates with period 42 d. The
planet interpretation is more likely, as the stellar surface is quiet,
exhibiting log(R'_{HK}) = -5.0 and brightness variations less than 1 millimag,
and any hypothetical surface inhomogeneity would have to persist in longitude
for 14 yr. Even with all three planets, an additional planet of
terrestrial--mass could orbit stably at ~1 AU. The star 55 Cancri is apparently
a normal, middle-aged main sequence star with a mass of 0.95 solar masses, rich
in heavy elements ([Fe/H] = +0.27). This high metallicity raises the issue of
the relationship between its age, rotation, and chromosphere.

related by R_{BLR} ~ L_{5100}^{0.5}. This differs from the result of Kaspi et

constant ionization parameter. In this note I investigate the source of the
discrepancy. McLure & Jarvis use quasar luminosities based on the single-epoch,
multichannel-spectrophotometer measurements of Neugebauer et al. (1987),
obtained in 1980. I show that the Neugebauer et al. fluxes are systematically
higher, by a constant flux offset, compared with the multi-epoch CCD
measurements of Kaspi et al., obtained concurrently with the echo-mapping
radii. In addition, McLure & Jarvis erred when converting these fluxes to
luminosities. The two effects compound to a typical factor 2 (0.3 dex)
overestimate of the luminosities of the PG quasars in the sample. Since McLure
& Jarvis did adopt the Seyfert luminosities in Kaspi et al. (2000), they
obtained a slope that is flatter by 0.2.

phase-dependent absorption lines at energies ~0.7 keV and ~1.4 keV. Moreover,
these broad spectral features have significant substructure, suggesting that
they are due to the blending of several narrower lines. We interpret such
features as evidence for an atmosphere containing metals and a magnetic field
value of a few 10^12 G, consistent with the observed spin-down rate
P_dot=(1.98+/-0.83)*10^(-14) s/s. Since 1E 1207-5209 is the only X-ray emitting

unique combination of age and energetics that characterize this object. We
suggest that a young age and a low level of magnetospheric activity are
favorable conditions for the detection of atomic spectral features from metals
in neutron star atmospheres, which would be either blanketed by a thin layer of
accreted hydrogen in older objects or masked by non-thermal processes in young
energetic pulsars.

proposed, which includes two additional features: linear conversion and walkoff
(group-velocity difference) between two components of the fundamental-frequency
(FF) wave. Physical interpretations of the model are possible in both temporal
and spatial domains. In the absence of the intrinsic walkoff, the linear mixing
makes real soliton solutions stable or unstable, depending on the relative sign
of the two FF components. Unstable solitons spontaneously re-arrange themselves
into stable ones. Fundamental solitons change their shape (in particular, they
develop chirp) but remain stable if the intrinsic walkoff is included. In
addition, quasi-stable double-humped solitary waves are found in the latter
case.

discussed. They hold both for hadron and nuclear stable targets of arbitrary
spin and are exact in strong interactions. Examples of applications to the
cases of proton and deuteron targets are given. The legitimacy of the
dispersive approach in the Standard Model is discussed.

pair of microwave transitions between hyperfine levels of the $(n,L)=(37,35)$
state of antiprotonic helium. This experiment confirms the quadruplet hyperfine
structure due to the interaction of the antiproton orbital angular momentum,
the electron spin and the antiproton spin as predicted by Bakalov and Korobov.
The measured frequencies of $\nu_{\text HF}^+ =12.89596 \pm 0.00034$ GHz and
$\nu_{\text HF}^- =12.92467 \pm 0.00029$ GHz agree with recent theoretical
calculations on a level of $ 6 \times10^{-5}$.
