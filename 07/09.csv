of the shape coefficient converting the measured central velocity dispersion $

cause of the tilt, due to aperture effects. Moreover the ratio between the

roughly constant along the luminosity sequence of ellipticals: H-band

addition, we find that the increase in helium abundance changes the mass-loss
properties by small amounts (up to about 0.2 dex in log Mdot), while CNO
processing is relatively unimportant for the mass-loss rate. A comparison
between our mass loss predictions and the observations is performed for four
relatively well-studied LBVs. The comparison shows that (i) the winds of LBVs
are driven by radiation pressure on spectral lines, (ii) the variable mass loss
behaviour of LBVs during their S Doradus-type variation cycles is explained by
changes in the line driving efficiency, notably due to the
recombination/ionisation of Fe IV/III and Fe III/II, and finally, (iii) the
winds of LBVs can be used to derive their masses, as exemplified by the case of
AG Car, for which we derive a present-day mass of 35 Msun.

at five frequencies show the radio spectral energy distribution is
well-described by a power law with spectral index +0.69 (+-0.05), as expected
for free-free wind emission. The derived ionized mass loss rate allowing for
distance uncertainties is M(dot) = 3.8 (+-2.6)e-5 M_sun/yr. The CCD X-ray

modeled as an absorbed multi-temperature optically thin plasma. Nonsolar
abundances are inferred with Fe notably deficient. The X-ray emission is
dominated by cool plasma at kT_cool = 0.6 keV, but a harder component is also
detected with a derived temperature kT_hot = 3.0 - 4.2 keV if the emission is
thermal. This is too high to be explained by radiative wind shock models and
the luminosity of the hard component is 3 orders of magnitude lower than
expected for accretion onto a neutron star companion. We argue that the hard
emission could be produced by the WR wind shocking onto a normal
(nondegenerate) stellar companion at close separation. Using comparable data
sets, we show that the X-ray and radio properties of EZ CMa are strikingly
similar to those of the WN5-6 star WR110. This similarity points to common
X-ray and radio emission processes in WN stars and discredits the idea that EZ

out clearly especially when contaminating field LMC stars are statistically
removed. The background subtracted CMD also visibly displays a red subgiant
branch extending about 1.5 mag below the younger turn-off and the clump of red
giants. The significance of the secondary turn-off in NGC 1868 was confirmed
with Monte-Carlo simulations and bootstrapping techniques. Star-counts in
selected regions in the cluster CMD indicate a mass ratio of old
population/young population in the range 5% <= M_{old} / M_{young} <= 12%,
depending on the mass function slope. The existence of such a subpopulation in
NGC 1868 is significant even in the presence of uncertainties in background
subtraction. The possibility that the secondary turn-off is associated with the
field star population was examined by searching for similar features in CMDs of
field stars. Statistically significant excesses of stars redwards of the
main-sequence were found in all such fields in the range 20 <= m_{555} <= 22.
These however are much broader features that do not resemble the main-sequence
termination of a single population. We also discuss other alternative

peculiar stars or CMD discontinuities associated with the Bohm-Vitense gap.

imaging survey of all known (96) low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs)
at D<19Mpc. We find that almost half of all LINERs and low-luminosity Seyferts
have flat-spectrum radio cores when observed at 150mas resolution. Higher
(2mas) resolution observations of a flux-limited subsample have provided a 100%
(16 of 16) detection rate of pc-scale radio cores, with implied brightness
temperatures > 10^8 K. The five LLAGNs with the highest core radio fluxes also
have pc-scale `jets.' Compact radio cores are almost exclusively found in
massive ellipticals and in type1 nuclei. The core radio power is correlated
with the nuclear optical `broad' Halpha luminosity, the nuclear optical
`narrow' emission line luminosity and width, and with the galaxy luminosity. In
these correlations LLAGNs fall close to the low-luminosity extrapolations of
more powerful AGNs. About half of all LLAGNs with multiple epoch data show
significant inter-year radio variability.
  Investigation of a sample of ~150 nearby bright galaxies, most of them
LLAGNs, shows that the nuclear (<150mas size) radio power is strongly
correlated with both the black hole mass and the galaxy bulge luminosity;
linear regression fits to all ~150 galaxies give: log P(2cm) = 1.31 log
M_blackhole + 8.77 and log P(2cm) = 1.89 log L_B(bulge) - 0.17. Low accretion
rates are implied in both advection- and jet-type models. In brief, all
evidence points towards the presence of accreting massive black holes in a
large fraction, perhaps all, of LLAGNs.

Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dfGRS) for observational evidence of features produced
by the baryons. A non-negligible baryon fraction produces relatively sharp
oscillatory features at specific wavenumbers in the matter power spectrum.
However, the mere existence of baryons will also produce a global suppression
of the power spectrum. We look for both of these features using the false
discovery rate (FDR) statistic. We show that the window effects on the
Abell/ACO power spectrum are minimal, which has allowed for the discovery of
discrete oscillatory features in the power spectrum. On the other hand, there
are no statistically significant oscillatory features in the 2dFGRS power
spectrum, which is expected from the survey's broad window function. After
accounting for window effects, we apply a scale-independent bias to the 2dFGRS
power spectrum, P_{Abell}(k) = b^2P_{2dF}(k) and b = 3.2. We find that the
overall shapes of the Abell/ACO and the biased 2dFGRS power spectra are
entirely consistent over the range 0.02 <= k <= 0.15hMpc^-1. We examine the
range of Omega_{matter} and baryon fraction for which these surveys could
detect significant suppression in power. The reported baryon fractions for both
the Abell/ACO and 2dFGRS surveys are high enough to cause a detectable
suppression in power (after accounting for errors, windows and k-space
sampling). Using the same technique, we also examine, given the best fit baryon
density obtained from BBN, whether it is possible to detect additional
suppression due to dark matter-baryon interaction. We find that the limit on
dark matter cross section/mass derived from these surveys are the same as those
ruled out in a recent study by Chen, Hannestad and Scherrer.

  Flaring levels of 0.4 to 13 times that of the Crab Nebula flux provided
sufficient statistics for a detailed study of the energy spectrum between 380
GeV and 8.2 TeV as a function of flux level. These spectra are well described
by a power law with an exponential cutoff. There is no evidence for variation
in the cutoff energy with flux, and all spectra are consistent with an average
value for the cutoff energy of 4.3 TeV. The spectral index varies between 1.89

the total 2000/2001 data set. Spectral measurements of Mrk~421 from previous
years (1995/96 and 1999) by the Whipple collaboration are consistent with this
flux-spectral index correlation, which suggest that this may be a constant or a

mechanism from external absorption effects.

total length of the jet arms is ~60 mas in the EVN map and ~300 mas in the

around 50 million galaxies to a magnitude limit g ~ 23. The second part of the
survey, taking place concurrently with the imaging, is obtaining spectra for up
to 1 million galaxies and 100,000 quasars. From these spectra we obtain
redshifts and hence distances, in order to map out the three-dimensional
distribution of galaxies and quasars in the Universe. These observations will
be used to constrain models of cosmology and of galaxy formation and evolution.

magnetic white dwarfs and neutron stars. According to this scenario, the
magnetic symmetry axis of the model inclines at a gradually increasing angle
(the so-called ``turn-over angle'') relative to the invariant angular momentum
axis. Consequently, the model becomes ``perpendicular rotator'' (i.e., its
turn-over angle becomes almost 90 degrees) on a ``turn-over timescale''
calculated to be ~ (a few)x10^6 - (a few)x10^7 yr for the examined white dwarf
models and ~ 10^1 - 10^3 yr for the examined neutron star models. Furthermore,
the initial differential rotation of the model turns to uniform rotation due to
angular momentum mixing caused by hydrodynamic Alfven waves propagating along
the poloidal magnetic field lines. Our numerical results show that, during the
turn-over phase, the spin-down time rate is large, while the spin-down power
remains small; so, the turn-over phase is a characteristic case for which an
eventually observed large spin-down time rate should not be interpreted as
implying a large spin-down power.

BALQSO APM 08279+5255 originating from material moving at relativistic
velocities with respect to the central source. The large flux magnification by
a factor of ~ 100 provided by the gravitational lens effect combined with the
large redshift (z = 3.91) of the quasar have facilitated the acquisition of the
first high signal-to-noise X-ray spectrum of a quasar containing X-ray BALs.
Our analysis of the X-ray spectrum of APM 08279+5255 places the rest-frame
energies of the two observed absorption lines at 8.1 and 9.8 keV. The detection
of each of these lines is significant at the > 99.9% confidence level based on
the F-test. Assuming that the absorption lines are from Fe xxv Kalpha, the
implied bulk velocities of the X-ray BALs are ~ 0.2c and ~ 0.4c, respectively.
The observed high bulk velocities of the X-ray BALs combined with the
relatively short recombination time-scales of the X-ray absorbing gas imply
that the absorbers responsible for the X-ray BALs are located at radii of < 2 x
10^(17) cm, within the expected location of the UV absorber. With this implied
geometry the X-ray gas could provide the necessary shielding to prevent the UV
absorber from being completely ionized by the central X-ray source, consistent
with hydrodynamical simulations of line-driven disk winds. Estimated
mass-outflow rates for the gas creating the X-ray BALs are typically less than
a solar mass per year. Our spectral analysis also indicates that the continuum
X-ray emission of APM 08279+5255 is consistent with that of a typical
radio-quiet quasar with a spectral slope of Gamma = 1.72(-0.05,+0.06).

doped MgB2 samples. Co-substitution of B by Si and C counterbalanced the
effects of single-element doping, decreasing Tc by only 1.5K, introducing
pinning centres effective at high fields and temperatures and enhancing Jc and
Hirr significantly. Compared to the non-doped sample, Jc for the 10wt% doped
sample increased by a factor of 32 at 5K and 8T, 42 at 20K and 5T, and 14 at
30K and 2T. At 20K, which is considered to be a benchmark operating temperature
for MgB2, the best Jc for the doped sample was 2.4x10^5A/cm2 at 2T, which is
comparable to Jc of the best Ag/Bi-2223 tapes. At 20K and 4T, Jc was
36,000A/cm2, which was twice as high as for the best MgB2 thin films and an
order of magnitude higher than for the best Fe/MgB2 tapes. Because of such high
performance, it is anticipated that the future MgB2 conductors will be made
using the formula of MgBxSiyCz instead of the pure MgB2.

of the horizontal symmetry breaking scale. If a third right handed neutrino is
introduced to satisfy quark lepton symmetry, it is unprotected by the
horizontal symmetry, becomes superheavy with a Planck scale mass and decouples

bimaximal pattern for the neutrino mixing with an inverted mass hierarchy and
is compatible with all data. It predicts a correlation between the solar mixing

of strings, so-called `chaotic strings' are introduced. These can be used to
provide the `noise' for second quantization of ordinary strings via the Parisi-
Wu approach of stochastic quantization. Extensive numerical evidence is
presented that the vacuum energy of chaotic strings is minimized for the
numerical values of the observed standard model parameters, i.e. in this
extended approach to second quantization concrete predictions for vacuum
expectations of dilaton-like fields and hence on masses and coupling constants
can be given. Low-energy fermion and boson masses are correctly obtained with a
precision of 3-4 digits, the electroweak and strong coupling strengths with a
precision of 4-5 digits. In particular, the minima of the vacuum energy yield
high-precision predictions of the Higgs mass (154 GeV), of the neutrino masses
(1.45E-5 eV, 2.57E-3 eV, 4.92E-2 eV) and of the GUT scale (1.73E16 GeV).

theory of the nuclear many-body problem. The Lorentz-invariant effective field
theory contains nucleons, pions, isoscalar scalar ($\sigma$) and vector

nonlinear realization of $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry and has three
desirable features: it uses the same degrees of freedom to describe the
axial-vector current and the strong-interaction dynamics, it satisfies the
symmetries of the underlying theory of quantum chromodynamics, and its
parameters can be calibrated using strong-interaction phenomena, like hadron
scattering or the empirical properties of finite nuclei. Moreover, it has
recently been verified that for normal nuclear systems, it is possible to
systematically expand the effective lagrangian in powers of the meson fields

emission of $e^+e^-$ pairs in pion-nucleus reactions and contribute to the
dilepton spectra observed in relativistic heavy ion collisions. They are
dominated by the decay of low-lying baryon resonances into vector meson-nucleon
channels. The vector mesons materialize subsequently into $e^+e^-$ pairs. Using
$\pi N\to \rho^0 N$ and $\pi N \to \omega N$ amplitudes calculated in the

states of open and dissipative quantum systems. We discuss stationary states of
open quantum systems, which coincide with stationary states of closed quantum
systems. Open quantum systems with pure stationary states of linear oscillator
are suggested. We consider stationary states for the Lindblad equation. We
discuss bifurcations of pure stationary states for open quantum systems which
are quantum analogs of classical dynamical bifurcations.

parametric down-conversion pumped by a ultrafast laser pulse exhibits strong
decoherence in its polarization entanglement, an effect which can be attributed
to the clock effect of the pump pulse or, equivalently, to distinguishing
spectral information in the two-photon state. Here, we propose novel temporal
and spectral engineering techniques to eliminate these detrimental decoherence
effects. The temporal engineering of the two-photon wavefunction results in a
universal Bell-state synthesizer that is independent of the choice of pump
source, crystal parameters, wavelengths of the interacting photons, and the
bandwidth of the spectral filter. In the spectral engineering technique, the
distinguishing spectral features of the two-photon state are eliminated through
modifications to the two-photon source. In addition, spectral engineering also
provides a means for the generation of polarization-entangled states with novel
spectral characteristics: the frequency-correlated state and the
frequency-uncorrelated state.

pressure. We have also studied the thermal-noise squeezing when the external
force is parametrically modulated. We have observed both the 50% theoretical
limit of squeezing at low gain and the parametric oscillation of the mirror for
a large gain.
