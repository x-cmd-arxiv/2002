densities and angular momentum while displaying variability on many time scales

help explain disk formation with the observed quasi-Keplerian (as opposed to
expanding) velocity structure and their variability. We focus on the effects of
the rapid rotation of Be stars, considering the regime where centrifugal forces
provide the dominant radial support of the disk material. Using a kinematic
description of the angular velocity, vphi(r), in the disk and a parametric
model of an aligned field with a strength B(r) we develop analytic expressions
for the disk properties that allow us to estimate the stellar surface field
strength necessary to create such a disk for a range of stars on the
main-sequence. The model explains why disks are most common for main-sequence
stars at about spectral class B2 V. The earlier type stars with very fast and
high density winds would require unacceptably strong surface fields (> 10^3
Gauss) to form torqued disks, while the late B stars (with their low mass loss
rates) tend to form disks that produce only small fluxes in the dominant Be
diagnostics. For stars at B2 V the average surface field required is about 300
Gauss. The predicted disks provide an intrinsic polarization and a flux at
Halpha comparable to observations. We also discuss whether the effect on field
containment of the time dependent accumulation of matter in the flux tubes/disk
can help explain some of the observed variability of Be star disks.

at high degrees, individual modes blend into ridges. Once modes have blended
into ridges, the power distribution of the ridge defines the ridge central
frequency and it will mask the true underlying mode frequency. An accurate
model of the amplitude of the peaks that contribute to the ridge power
distribution is needed to recover the underlying mode frequency from fitting
the ridge.

emission spectrum is obtained. Tests with small models for which the radiative
transfer problem can be solved directly show that with our method one can
easily obtain an accuracy of a few per cent. We show spectra computed from

represent starless, inhomogeneous interstellar clouds embedded in the normal

large variations that follow the filamentary density distribution. The power
law index of the spatial power spectrum of the column density map is -2.8. In
infrared maps temperature variations increase the power at high spatial
frequencies, and the index varies between -2.5 and -2.7. Assuming constant dust
properties throughout the cloud, the IRAS ratio <I_60/I_100> decreases in
densest cores only by a factor of ~4 compared with the value in diffuse medium.
In observations the ratio can decrease twice as much even in optically thinner

long been thought to be in an unusual evolutionary state, in which the binary
is embedded in a common envelope. Support for this idea comes from X2127+119's
absorption lines, which are blue shifted at all orbital phases, indicating the
existence of outflows from the system. A common-envelope scenario implies that
the absorption lines should exhibit maximum blue shift near mid-eclipse (binary
phase 0.0). We have re-analysed INT spectra of X2127+119 obtained in 1986, 1987
and 1988 using the latest orbital ephemeris (substantially different from that
used in the original analysis), and find that the orbital phase at which the
absorption lines show a maximum blue shift is not 0.0, but rather 0.25 -- 0.3.
These results indicate that a common-envelope scenario for X2127+119 may not
work. In addition, from spectrograms of the He II 4686 line, we report the
first tentative detection of X2127+119's companion star.

test for a hidden quasar is to look for the predicted high mid-IR luminosity
from the nuclear obscuring matter. The nuclear waste heat is detected and well
isolated in the nearest narrow line radio galaxy, Cen A. This confirms other
indications that Cen A does contain a modest quasar-like nucleus. However we
show here that M87 does not: at high spatial resolution, the mid-IR nucleus is
seen to be very weak, and consistent with simple synchrotron emission from the

since they are formed at a wide range of depths within the atmosphere. The
different Balmer lines are formed at slightly different depths making them
useful atmospheric diagnostics. The low sensitivity to surface gravity for
stars cooler than ~8000 K makes them excellent diagnostics in the treatment of
atmospheric convection. For hotter stars Balmer profiles are sensitive to both
effective temperature and surface gravity. Provided we know the surface gravity
of these stars from some other method (e.g. from eclipsing binary systems), we
can use them to determine effective temperature.
  In previous work, we have found no significant systematic problems with using
uvby photometry to determine atmospheric parameters of fundamental (and
standard) stars. In fact, uvby was found to be very good for obtaining both
Teff and log g. Using Halpha and Hbeta profiles, we have found that both the
Canuto & Mazzitteli and standard Kurucz mixing-length theory without
approximate overshooting are both in agreement to within the uncertainties of
the fundamental stars. Overshooting models were always clearly discrepant. Some
evidence was found for significant disagreement between all treatments of
convection and fundamental values around 8000~9000K, but these results were for
fundamental stars without fundamental surface gravities. We have used stars
with fundamental values of both Teff and log g to explore this region in more

relaxation dynamics on high temperature superconductors (HTSC) probed by a
femtosecond time-resolved optical spectroscopy, and compare the results with
the data obtained on quasi two dimensional charge density waves. In these
experiments, a femtosecond laser pump pulse excites electron-hole pairs via an
inter-band transition in the material. These hot carriers rapidly release their
energy via electron-electron and electron-phonon collisions reaching states
near the Fermi energy within ~100 fs. If an energy gap is present in the
low-energy density of states (DOS), it inhibits the final relaxation step and
photoexcited carriers accumulate above the gap causing a transient change in
reflectivity arising from excited state absorption. The relaxation and
recombination processes of photoexcited quasiparticles, governed by the
magnitude, anisotropy and the T-dependence of the low energy gap, are monitored
by measuring the resulting photoinduced absorption as a function of time after
the photoexcitation. This way, the studies of carrier relaxation dynamics give
us direct information of the T-dependent changes in the low energy DOS. The
technique is particularly useful to probe the systems with spatial
inhomogeneities, where different local environments give rise to different
relaxation rates. The data on series of HTSC-s show evidence for the
coexistence of two distinct relaxation processes, whose T-dependences seem to
be governed by two different energy scales: a T-independent pseudogap and a
mean-field-like T-dependent gap that opens at Tc. The data suggest the origin
of the two-gap behavior is in the intrinsic microscopic spatial inhomogeneity

electrochemical complexing technique. The confinement of the charge transport
along the hetero-nano stripes at the interface was studied at different
temperatures ranging from 300 K to 77 K. The high Jc along the interface at
different temperatures is explained on the basis of Andreev reflections from
the interface followed by confinement of charge transport along ab-plane
(superconducting path) of Tl-2223 unit cell. The model has been proposed to
explain the mechanism of high Tc and Jc observed at hetero-nano interface. The
phenomenon of a pathway to high Tc and Jc with Tl-2223/Al hetero-nano interface
was ascertained by destroying the interface by irradiating the heterostructure.

links, path length of wireless networks can be reduced drastically without
affecting clustering. What is even more interesting is that such links need not
be formed randomly but may be confined to a limited number of hops between the
connected nodes. This has an important practical implication, as now we can
introduce a distributed algorithm in large-scale wireless networks, based on

  Density matrix must be changed by a progenitrix or as we call it throughout
this paper, density pro-matrix. This pro-matrix is a deformed density matrix,
which at low energy limit turns to usual one.
  Below the explicit form of the deformation is described. Implications of

symmetry is hidden, i.e. it does not arise from geometrical spacetime
isometries, but the whole Hilbert space turns out to be an irreducible unitary
representation of SL(2,R) and the time evolution is embodied in the unitary
representation. In this case the symmetry does not depend on the mass of the
particle and, if the representation is faithful, the conformal observable K
shows thermal properties. If the Killing horizon is nonbifurcate the conformal
symmetry is manifest, i.e. it arises from geometrical spacetime isometries. The
SL(2,R) representation which arises from the geometry selects a hidden
conformal representation. Also in that case the Hilbert space is an irreducible
representation of SL(2,R) and the group conformal symmetries embodies the time
evolution with respect to the local Killing time. However no thermal properties
are involved. The conformal observable K gives rise to Killing time evolution
of the quantum state with respect to another global Killing time present in the

function of the protein-pigment complex photosystem I (PSI) of the

recently obtained high resolution structure of this complex exhibits an
aggregate of 96 chlorophylls that are electronically coupled to function as a

Hamiltonian for the chlorophyll aggregate to describe excitation transfer
dynamics and spectral properties of PSI. For this purpose, a new kinetic
expansion method, the sojourn expansion, is introduced. Our study shows that at
room temperature fluctuations of site energies have little effect on the
calculated excitation lifetime and quantum yield, which compare favorably with
experimental results. The efficiency of the system is found to be robust
against `pruning' of individual chlorophylls. An optimality of the arrangement
of chlorophylls is identified through the quantum yield in comparison with an
ensemble of randomly oriented chlorophylls, though, the quantum yield is seen
to change only within a narrow interval in such an ensemble.

related statistical properties of the unperturbed system. The type and rate of

the perturbation operator. For random eigenvector statistics the decay is
exponential with a rate fixed precisely by the variance of the perturbation's

"quant-ph/0207104","Tulsi Dass","Tulsi Dass","Towards an Autonomous Formalism for Quantum Mechanics","44 pages",,,"IITK/PHY/2002/45","quant-ph",,"  A formalism is presented in which quantum particle dynamics can be developed
on its own rather than `quantization' of an underlying classical theory. It is
proposed that the unification of probability and dynamics should be considered
as the basic feature of quantum theory. Arguments are given to show that when
such a unification is attempted at the configuration space level, the wave
funtions of Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger theory appear as the natural candidates for
the desired unification. A *-algebra $\mathcal{A}_{Q}$ of (not necessarily
bounded) linear operators acting on an appropriate dense set of these wave
functions appears as the arena for quantum kinematics. A simple generalization
of an existing formalism in noncommutative geometry is employed to develop the
notion of generalized algebraic symplectic structure (GASS) which can
accomodate classical and quantum symplectic structures as special cases.
Quantum kinematics and dynamics is developed in in the framework of a
noncommutative Hamiltonian system employing an appropriate GASS based in $
\mathcal{A}_{Q}$. The Planck constant is introduced at only one place -- in the
quantum symplectic form; its appearance at conventional places is then
automatic. Unitary Wigner symmetries appear as canonical transformations in the
noncommutative Hamiltonian system. A straightforward treatment of quantum -
classical correspondence is given in terms of appropriate GASSes.

obtain novel results for ballistic scattering in an external uniform force
field, where we provide analytical solutions for both the scattering waves and
the integrated particle flux. Our theory directly applies to p-wave
photodetachment in an electric field. Furthermore, illustrating the effects of
extended sources, we predict some properties of vortex-bearing atom laser beams
outcoupled from a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate under the influence of
gravity.

  Physics","Phys. Rev. A 66, 052103 (2002)","10.1103/PhysRevA.66.052103",,"quant-ph",,"  The Casimir effect in a dispersive and absorbing multilayered system is
considered adopting the (net) vacuum-field pressure point of view to the
Casimir force. Using the properties of the macroscopic field operators
appropriate for absorbing systems and a convenient compact form of the Green
function for a multilayer, a straightforward and transparent derivation of the
Casimir force in a lossless layer of an otherwise absorbing multilayer is
presented. The resulting expression in terms of the reflection coefficients of
the surrounding stacks of layers is of the same form as that obtained by Zhou
and Spruch for a purely dispersive multilayer using the (surface) mode
summation method [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 52}, 297 (1995)]. Owing to the recursion
relations which the generalized Fresnel coefficients satisfy, this result can
be applied to more complex systems with planar symmetry. This is illustrated by
calculating the Casimir force on a dielectric (metallic) slab in a planar
cavity with realistic mirrors. Also, a relationship between the Casimir force
and energy in two different layers is established.

strictly related to a structure of Stokes graph corresponding to such cases.
