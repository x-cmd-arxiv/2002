explosion) and perhaps slightly higher amounts of hydrogen than are currently
predicted to be mixed into the outer layers of SNe Ia. Thus, the non-detection
of hydrogen so far does not in and of itself rule out any current progenitor

Using hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate that there exists a family of

depends (approximately linearly) on both pulse longitude and pulse number. As
such, we argue that the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the longitude-time
data (called the Two-Dimensional Fluctuation Spectrum; 2DFS) presents an ideal
basis for studies of this phenomenon. We examine the 2DFS of a pulsar signal
synthesized using the parameters of an empirical model for sub-pulse behaviour.
We show that the transform concentrates the modulation power to a relatively
small area of phase space in the region corresponding to the characteristic
frequency of sub-pulses in longitude and pulse number. This property enables
the detection of the presence and parameters of drifting sub-pulses with great
sensitivity even in data where the noise level far exceeds the instantaneous
flux density of individual pulses. The amplitude of drifting sub-pulses is
modulated in time by scintillation and pulse nulling and in longitude by the
rotating viewing geometry (with an envelope similar to that of the mean pulse
profile). In addition, sub-pulse phase as a function of longitude and pulse
number can differ from that of a sinusoid due to variations in the drift rate
(often associated with nulling) and through the varying rate of traverse of
magnetic azimuth afforded by the sight line. These deviations from uniform
sub-pulse drift manifest in the 2DFS as broadening of the otherwise
delta-function response of a uniform sinusoid. We show how these phase and
amplitude variations can be extracted from the complex spectrum.

  The radiative force causes the magnetic field to initially grow linearly with
time. However, this linear growth holds for only a {\it restricted} time
interval which is of the order of the accretion time of the matter.
  The large magnetic fields recently found result from the fact that the linear
growth is unrestricted.
  A model of the Poynting-Robertson magnetic field generation close to the

of selection effects arising from the cosmological dimming of surface
brightness of high-z galaxies, and from the absorption of visible light by
internal dust and intergalactic HI clouds. As was found in our previous work,
in which the UV/optical HDF galaxies were compared with our model galaxies, we
find that our SAM reproduces counts of near-IR SDF galaxies in low-density
models, and that the standard CDM universe is not preferred, as suggested by
other recent studies. Moreover, we find that simple prescriptions for (1) the
timescale of star formation being proportional to the dynamical time scale of
the formation of galactic disks, (2) the size of galactic disks being
rotationally supported with the same specific angular momentum as that of

energy is parametrized in terms of the isoscalar contribution and the nuclear
symmetry energy in the isovector sector. High density behaviour of nuclear
symmetry energy plays an essential role in determining the composition of the
kaon-condensed neutron star matter which in turn affects the cooling

effect inhibits strongly direct URCA processes resulting in slower cooling of
neutron stars as only kaon-induced URCA cycles are present. In contrast, for
increasing symmetry energy direct URCA processes are allowed in the almost

elements, but with the clear exception of C, N, O and S. The present work is a
continuation of the studies by Paunzen et al. (1998, A&A, 335, 533), who
presented first results on the pulsational characteristics of the lambda Bootis
stars. Since then, we have observed 22 additional objects; we found eight new
pulsators and confirmed another one. Furthermore, new spectroscopic data
(Paunzen, 2001, A&A, 373, 633) allowed us to sort out misidentified candidates
and to add true members to the group. From 67 members of this group, only two
are not photometrically investigated yet which makes our analysis highly
representative. We have compared our results on the pulsational behaviour of
the lambda Bootis stars with those of a sample of delta Scuti type objects. We
find that at least 70% of all lambda Bootis type stars inside the classical
instability strip pulsate, and they do so with high overtone modes (Q <
0.020d). Only a few stars, if any, pulsate in the fundamental mode. Compared to
the delta Scuti stars, the cool and hot borders of the instability strip of the
lambda Bootis stars are shifted by about 25mmag, towards smaller (b-y)0. Using
published abundances and the metallicity sensitive indices of the Geneva
7-colour and Stroemgren uvbybeta systems, we have derived [Z] values which
describe the surface abundance of the heavier elements for the group members.
We find that the Period-Luminosity-Colour relation for the group of lambda
Bootis stars is within the errors identical with that of the normal delta Scuti
stars. No clear evidence for a statistically significant metallicity term was
detected.

evolution becomes nonlinear when the magnetic energy is comparable to the
kinetic energy of the viscous-scale eddies. A physical picture of the ensuing

considerations are supplemented with a simple Fokker--Planck model of the
nonlinear evolution of the magnetic-energy spectrum. It is found that, while
the shift of the bulk of the magnetic energy from the subviscous scales to the
velocity scales may be possible, it occurs very slowly -- at the resistive,

Five out of the nine sample galaxies show signs of morphological peculiarity
such as tidal debris or blue circumnuclear rings. We confirm that E/S0 galaxies
are rare in low-density regions, accounting for only ~8% of the total galaxy
population in such environments. We present spectroscopic observations of nine
galaxies in the sample, which are used, in conjunction with updated stellar
population models, to investigate star-formation histories. Environmental
effects on early-type galaxy evolution are investigated by comparison with a
sample of Fornax cluster E/S0s. Results from both samples are compared with
predictions from semi-analytic galaxy formation models. The Mg-sig relation of
E/S0s in low-density regions is shown to be indistinguishable from that of the
Fornax sample. Luminosity-weighted stellar ages and metallicities are
determined by considering various combinations of line-indices. At a given
luminosity, the E/S0 galaxies in low-density regions are younger than the E/S0s
in clusters (by ~2-3 Gyr), and also more metal-rich (by ~0.2 dex). We infer
that an anti-correlation of age and metallicity effects is responsible for
maintaining the zero-point of the Mg-sig relation. The youngest galaxies in our

three dimensions by means of a highly accurate Quantum-Monte-Carlo analysis.
Within the parameter regime studied (temperature and system size), we show that
the scaling behavior is consistent with a SO(5)-symmetric critical behavior in
a relative extendent transient regime. This holds both when the symmetry
breaking is caused by quantum fluctuations only as well as when also the static
(mean-field) symmetry is moderately broken. We argue that possible departure
away from the SO(5)-symmetric scaling occurs only in an extremely narrow
parameter regime, which is inaccessible both experimentally and numerically.

paramagnetic (PM) state of the double exchange (DE) model is described by using
the coherent-potential-approximation (CPA), which is combined with the
variational mean-field approach for the Curie temperature (T_C). Our CPA
approach is essentially non-local and based on the perturbation theory
expansion for the T-matrix with respect to the fluctuations of hoppings from
the ''mean values'' specified by matrix elements of the self energy, so that in
the first order it becomes identical to the DE theory by de Gennes. The
second-order effects, considered in the present work, can be viewed as an
extension of this theory. They are not negligible, and lead to a substantial
reduction of T_C in the one-orbital case. Even more dramatic changes are
expected in the case of orbital degeneracy, when each site of the cubic lattice
is represented by two e_g orbitals, which also specify the form of interatomic
transfer integrals. Particularly, the existence of two Van Hove singularities
in the spectrum of degenerate DE model may lead to the branching of CPA
solutions, when the Green function and the self energy become double-valued
functions in certain region of the complex plane. Such a behavior can be
interpreted as an intrinsic inhomogeneity of the PM state, which consists of
two phases characterized by different electronic densities. The phase
separation occurs below certain transition temperature, T_P, and naturally
explains the appearance of several magnetic transition points, which are
frequently seen in manganites.

provide a ranking of obligors in the sense that the rating categories indicate
the creditworthiness in terms of default probabilities. As a consequence, the
default probabilities ought to present a monotonous function of the ordered
rating categories. This requirement appears quite intuitive. In this paper,
however, we show that the intuition can be founded on mathematical facts. We
prove that, in the closely related context of a continuous score function,
monotonicity of the conditional default probabilities is equivalent to
optimality of the corresponding decision rules in the test-theoretic sense. As
a consequence, the optimality can be checked by inspection of the ordinal
dominance graph (also called Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) of the
score function: it obtains if and only if the curve is concave. We conclude the
paper by exploring the connection between the area under the ordinal dominance
graph and the so-called Information Value which is used by some vendors of
scoring systems.

particle (LKP), which is the gamma^*. KK number conservation implies that the

rather soft, the observation of KK excitations production and decay in collider

violating interactions mediated by gravity, which allow the gamma^* to decay to
a photon and a KK graviton. For a variety a models and a large range of
parameters, these decays will occur within the detector. Thus, pair production
of KK excitations will give rise to a striking collider signal, consisting of
two hard photons plus large missing energy (due to escaping gravitons). We
evaluate the cross-section for these signals at the Tevatron and LHC, and
derive the reach of these colliders in the search for universal extra

induces an extra term in the hamiltonian,which is crucual in determining the
ground state. We find that this collective potential has a natural meaning in
terms of non-commutative probability theory:it is the `free Fisher information'
discovered by Voiculescu. This formulation allows us to find a variational
principle for the classical theory described by such large N limits. We then
use the variational principle to study models more complex than the one
describing the quantum mechanics of a single hermitian matrix (i.e., go beyond
the so called D=1 barrier). We carry out approximate variational calculations

  process","22 pages. Minor changes in introduction",,,,"math.PR math-ph math.MP",,"  Consider the following method of card shuffling. Start with a deck of $N$
cards numbered 1 through N. Fix a parameter $p$ between 0 and 1. In this model
a ``shuffle'' consists of uniformly selecting a pair of adjacent cards and then
flipping a coin that is heads with probability p. If the coin comes up heads
then we arrange the two cards so that the lower numbered card comes before the
higher numbered card. If the coin comes up tails then we arrange the cards with
the higher numbered card first. In this paper we prove that for all p not equal
to 1/2, the mixing time of this card shuffling is O(N^2), as conjectured by
Diaconis and Ram [DR]. A novel feature of our proof is that the analysis of an
infinite (asymmetric exclusion) process plays an essential role in bounding the
mixing time of a finite process.

classification of three fundamental computational problems on tables:
existence, counting and entry-security.
  One major outcome of our work is that each of the following problems is
intractable already for ""slim"" 3-tables, with constant and smallest possible
number 3 of rows: (1) deciding existence of 3-tables with given consistent
2-marginals; (2) counting all 3-tables with given 2-marginals; (3) finding
whether an integer value is attained in entry (i,j,k) by at least one of the
3-tables satisfying given (feasible) 2-marginals. This implies that a
characterization of feasible marginals for such slim tables, sought by much
recent research, is unlikely to exist.
  Another important consequence of our study is a systematic efficient way of
embedding the set of 3-tables satisfying any given 1-marginals and entry upper
bounds in a set of slim 3-tables satisfying suitable 2-marginals with no entry
bounds. This provides a valuable tool for studying multi-index transportation

these codes can be very simply constructed as binary images under the Gray map
of linear codes over Z_4, the integers mod 4 (although this requires a slight
modification of the Preparata and Goethals codes). The construction implies
that all these binary codes are distance invariant. Duality in the Z_4 domain
implies that the binary images have dual weight distributions. The Kerdock and
""Preparata"" codes are duals over Z_4 -- and the Nordstrom-Robinson code is
self-dual -- which explains why their weight distributions are dual to each
other. The Kerdock and ""Preparata"" codes are Z_4-analogues of first-order
Reed-Muller and extended Hamming codes, respectively. All these codes are
extended cyclic codes over Z_4, which greatly simplifies encoding and decoding.
An algebraic hard-decision decoding algorithm is given for the ""Preparata"" code
