of Galactic globular clusters, the ""Oosterhoff dichotomy,"" according to the

understanding of this phenomenon, display a planar alignment in the outer halo.
This alignment, combined with evidence from kinematics and stellar population,
indicates a captured origin from a satellite galaxy. We show that, together
with the horizontal-branch evolutionary effect, the factor producing the
dichotomy could be a small time-gap between the cluster-formation epochs in the
Milky Way and the satellite. The results oppose the traditional view that the
metal-poorest clusters represent the indigenous and oldest population of the

emit gravitational waves in the kilohertz frequency range. To date, radio
astronomers have located about 1,300 pulsars, and can estimate that there are
about 2 times 10^8 neutron stars in the galaxy. Many of these are surely old
and cold enough that their interiors will contain matter in the superfluid or
superconducting state. In fact, the so-called glitch phenomenon in pulsars (a
sudden spin-up of the pulsar's crust) is best described by assuming the
presence of superfluid neutrons and superconducting protons in the inner crusts
and cores of the pulsars. Recently there has been much progress on modelling
the dynamics of superfluid neutron stars in both the Newtonian and general
relativistic regimes. We will discuss some of the main results of this recent
work, perhaps the most important being that superfluidity should affect the
gravitational waves from neutron stars (emitted, for instance, during a glitch)
by modifying both the rotational properties of the background star and the
modes of oscillation of the perturbed configuration. Finally, we present an
analysis of the so-called zero-frequency subspace (i.e. the space of
time-independent perturbations) and determine that it is spanned by two sets of
polar (or spheroidal) and two sets of axial (or toroidal) degenerate
perturbations for the general relativistic system. As in the Newtonian case,
the polar perturbations are the g-modes which are missing from the pulsation
spectrum of a non-rotating configuration, and the axial perturbations should
lead to two sets of r-modes when the degeneracy of the frequencies is broken by
having the background rotate.

expanding at 19 km/s and is dynamically as old as ~ 4800 yrs; it probably

(non-radiative) accretion flow have called into question the validity of this

from black hole candidates (BHC), however, these similarities are in many ways
only superficial. In some aspects, simple theories agree with the observations
quite well. The observed rapid variability is much more highly structured than

been interpreted in terms of simple models. On the other hand, debates have
arisen over even the most basic phenomenological issues concerning, e.g., the
geometry and dominant radiation mechanisms of the accretion flow. In this

point. There, an unphysical discontinuity arises due to the dropping of the
non-LLL eigenstates which join the LLL, making the LLL approximation no longer
valid. However, taking into account the effect of the non-LLL states at the
Bose point would only smoothen the discontinuity and not alter the physics
which is captured by the LLL projection: Close to the Bose point, the critical
filling factor either goes to infinity (usual bosons) in the screening
situation, or to 1/2 in the anti-screening situation, the difference between
the flux tubes orientation being relevant even when they carry an infinitesimal
fraction of the flux quantum. An exclusion statistics interpretation is
adduced, which explains this situation in semiclassical terms. It is further
shown how the exact solutions of the 3-anyon problem support this scenario as
far as the third cluster coefficient is concerned.

the formalism allows that the concrete behaviours take more (or possibly less)

  Eternity variables are introduced as a more powerful alternative for prophecy
variables and backward simulations. This formalism is semantically complete:
every simulation that preserves quiescence is a composition of a forward
simulation, an extension with eternity variables, and a refinement mapping.

preservation of quiescence.

  Recently, in the context of the quest for semiclassical states, states of the

geometry, it was realized that it might also be worthwhile to study different
representations of the algebra A of observables.
  The content of the present note is the observation that under some mild
assumptions, the mathematical structure of representations of A can be analyzed
rather effortlessly, to a certain extent: Each representation can be labeled by
sets of functions and measures on the space of (generalized) connections that

of gauge invariant QCD currents is presented. Each contribution to the modified
expansion, which is based on a delocalized multipole expansion of a
perturbatively determined coefficient function, sums up an infinite series of
local operators. On a more formal level the delocalized operator expansion
corresponds to an optimal choice of basis sets in the dual spaces which are
associated with the interplay of perturbative and nonperturbative N-point
correlations in a distorted vacuum. A consequence of the delocalized expansion
is the running of condensates with the external momentum. Phenomenological
evidence is gathered that the gluon condensate, often being the leading
nonperturbative parameter in the OPE, is indeed a function of resolution.
Within a model calculation of the nonperturbative corrections to the ground
state energy of a heavy quarkonium system it is shown exemplarily that the
convergence properties are better than those of the OPE. Potential applications
of the delocalized operator expansion in view of estimates of the violation of
local quark-hadron duality are discussed.

type-IIB case, we first show that the Penrose limit makes the size of the

this observation, we consider, in taking the Penrose limit, the generalization
of the null geodesic to incorporate the tilted direction between the equator of
$S^3$ and one of the torus directions. For generic values of the tilting angle,
supersymmetries are not preserved. When the limit is taken along the torus
direction, 16 supersymmetries are preserved. For the ordinary Penrose limit, 16
generic and 8 `supernumerary' supersymmetries are observed. In the Penrose
limit of Hopf-dualized type-IIA geometry, only 4 supersymmetries are preserved.

meson from the c bar{c} pair, which can be conveniently parameterized. In a
pA/AA collision, as the c bar{c} pair pass through the nuclear medium, it gains
relative square momentum. As a result, some of the c bar{c} pairs can gain
enough momentum to cross the threshold to become open charm meson, leading to
suppression in pA/AA collisions. The model without any free parameter could
describe the of NA50 data on centrality dependence of the ratio's; J/psi over
Drell-Yan, J/psi over minimum bias and also the Drell-Yan over minimum bias.
The model was used to predict J/psi suppression at RHIC energy. At RHIC energy,
hard processes may be important. With hard processes included, J/psi's are
strongly suppressed, in agreement with other model calculations. We also show
that centrality dependence of J/psi over minimum bias ratio can be used to
determine the fraction of hard processes in the collision.

Strictly contractive channels are simple enough, yet exhibit very interesting
features, which are meaningful from the physical point of view. In particular,
they allow us to incorporate the crucial assumption of finite precision of all
experimentally realizable operations. Strict contractivity also helps us gain
insight into the thermodynamics of noisy quantum evolutions (approach to
equilibrium). Our investigation into thermodynamics focuses on the
entropy-energy balance in quantum registers and computers under the influence
of strictly contractive noise. Using entropy-energy methods, we are able to
appraise the thermodynamical resources needed to maintain reliable operation of
the computer. We also obtain estimates of the largest tolerable error rate.

evolution of the 2-level atom then stems from the reversible time evolution of
atom and field together. Mathematically speaking, we have constructed a Markov
dilation of the semigroup. The next step is to drive the atom by a laser and to
count the photons emitted into the field by the decaying 2-level atom. For
every possible sequence of photon counts we construct a map that gives the time
evolution of the 2-level atom inferred by that sequence. The family of maps

describes the structure of these processes, which brings us into the field of
