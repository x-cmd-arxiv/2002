redshift 6.28 SDSS quasar has raised the tantalizing possibility that we have
detected the reionization of the universe. However, a neutral fraction (of
hydrogen) as small as 0.1% is sufficient to cause the GP trough, hence its
detection alone cannot rule out reionization at a much earlier epoch. The
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization anisotropy offers an alternative
way to explore the dark age of the universe. We show that for most models
constrained by the current CMB data and by the discovery of a GP trough
(showing that reionization occurred at z > 6.3), MAP can detect the
reionization signature in the polarization power spectrum. The expected 1-sigma
error on the measurement of the electron optical depth is around 0.03 with a
weak dependence on the value of that optical depth. Such a constraint on the
optical depth will allow MAP to achieve a 1-sigma error on the amplitude of the
primordial power spectrum of 6%. MAP with two years (Planck with one year) of
observation can distinguish a model with 50% (6%) partial ionization between
redshifts of 6.3 and 20 from a model in which hydrogen was completely neutral
at redshifts greater than 6.3. Planck will be able to distinguish between
different reionization histories even when they imply the same optical depth to
electron scattering for the CMB photons.

estimate the accuracy to which peculiar velocities and gas temperatures of

scales at several frequencies it will be possible to measure peculiar
velocities to an accuracy of about 130 km/s and gas temperatures to better than
1 keV. The limiting factor for the accuracy of the measured peculiar velocity
is the presence of bulk motions within the galaxy cluster, even for apparently
relaxed clusters. The accuracy of the temperature is mainly limited by noise.
These results are independent of redshift. Such constraints can best be
achieved with only three frequencies: one in the Rayleigh-Jeans region (<40
GHz), one near 150 GHz, and the third at 300 GHz or higher. Measurements at the
null of the thermal SZ effect are of marginal utility, other than as a

all consistent with an upper bound of E(B-V) < 0.45 mag established by
comparing the early-time color of SN 1999gi with that of an infinitely hot
blackbody, and yield a probable reddening of E(B-V) = 0.21 +/- 0.09 mag. Using
the expanding photosphere method (EPM), we derive a distance to SN 1999gi of
11.1^{+2.0}_{-1.8} Mpc and an explosion date of 1999 December

balance, where the whole energy produced by a viscous heating was emitted to
the sides of the disk.
  One of the most important new invention of this theory was the
phenomenological treatment of the turbulent viscosity, known the `` alpha''
prescription, where the (r phi) component of the stress tensor was approximated
by (alpha p) with a unknown constant alpha.
  This prescription played the role in the accretion disk theory as well
important as the mixing-length theory of convection for stellar evolution.
Sources of turbulence in the accretion disk are discussed, including
hydrodynamical turbulence, convection and magnetic field role. In parallel to
the optically thick geometrically thin accretion disk models, a new branch of
the optically thin accretion disk models was discovered, with a larger
thickness for the same total luminosity. The choice between these solutions
should be done of the base of a stability analysis.
  The ideas underlying the necessity to include advection into the accretion
disk theory are presented and first models with advection are reviewed.
  The present status of the solution for a low-luminous optically thin
accretion disk model with advection is discussed and the limits for an
advection dominated accretion flows (ADAF) imposed by the presence of magnetic
field are analysed. Related problems of mass ejection from accretion disks and

9.4 +/- 2.4 kpc. This value is based on both the measured size of 220 mas for

scattering screen along the line of sight to the W28 OH(1720 MHz) masers must
be at 4.7 +/- 1.2 kpc for this minimum pulsar distance. The screen may be
placed closer to the Earth, but for reasonable values of the pulsar distance
(i.e., the pulsar is within the Galaxy), this choice leads to a negligible
scattering contribution to the sizes of the masers. Thus the OH(1720 MHz)
masers, at a distance of 2.5 +/- 0.7 kpc, are unaffected by interstellar

possible climatic variations. We find that although the geological evidence for
the occurrence of IAEs in the past Eon is not unequivocal, it appears to have a

the analysis undertaken here, feedback processes from stellar energy source are
omitted. We find that the velocity field of the disk in a non-linear phase
shows a steady power-law energy spectrum over three-orders of magnitude in wave
number. This implies that the random velocity field can be modeled as
fully-developed, stationary turbulence. Gravitational and thermal instabilities
under the influence of galactic rotation contribute to form the turbulent
velocity field. The Toomre effective Q value, in the non-linear phase, ranges
over a wide range, and gravitationally stable and unstable regions are
distributed patchily in the disk. These results suggest that large-scale
galactic rotation coupled with the self-gravity of the gas can be the ultimate
energy sources that maintain the turbulence in the local ISM. We find that our
models of turbulent rotating disks are consistent with the velocity dispersion
of an extended HI disk in the dwarf galaxy, NGC 2915, where there is no

variable over the course of the observation but shows only weak spectral
variability, with the fractional variability amplitude remaining approximately
constant over more than a decade in energy. The curved continuum shape and weak

groundstate for an infinite 2D system, and the confinement which imposes its
circular symmetry on the outer edge. As a result a hexagonal Wigner lattice is
formed in the central area while at the border of the cluster the particles are

evolutionary time scales. For protein interaction networks, global statistical
features of their structure can now be inferred consistently from several
large-throughput datasets. Understanding the underlying evolutionary dynamics
is crucial for discerning random parts of the network from biologically
important properties shaped by natural selection. We present a detailed
statistical analysis of the protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
based on several large-throughput datasets. Protein pairs resulting from gene
duplications are used as tracers into the evolutionary past of the network.
  From this analysis, we infer rate estimates for two key evolutionary
processes shaping the network: (i) gene duplications and (ii) gain and loss of
interactions through mutations in existing proteins, which are referred to as
link dynamics. Importantly, the link dynamics is asymmetric, i.e., the
evolutionary steps are mutations in just one of the binding parters. The link
turnover is shown to be much faster than gene duplications. According to this
model, the link dynamics is the dominant evolutionary force shaping the
statistical structure of the network, while the slower gene duplication
dynamics mainly affects its size. Specifically, the model predicts (i) a broad
distribution of the connectivities (i.e., the number of binding partners of a
protein) and (ii) correlations between the connectivities of interacting
proteins.

out-of-plane oscillating behavior as a result of a reproducible sequence of
instabilities. The wavelength of such a phenomenon is in the micrometer range

different glassy materials providing that a typical length scale characterizing
internal heterogeneities was lower than a threshold limit estimated to few

for the droplets: they are clusters obtained by joining nearest-neighbour spins
of the same sign with some bond probability p_B, which is the minimal
probability that still allows the existence of a percolating cluster at the
critical temperature T_c. By means of lattice Monte Carlo simulations we find

the same quantities in Euclidean anti-de Sitter (EAdS), and takes the two
boundaries of dS to the single EAdS boundary via an antipodal identification.
Second we compute the action of scalar fields on dS as a functional of boundary

cosmological constant in which the equal time sections are arbitrary genus
Riemann surfaces, and compute the action of these spaces as a functional of
boundary data from the Einstein gravity and Chern-Simons gravity points of
view. These studies suggest that if de Sitter space is dual to a Euclidean
conformal field theory (CFT), this theory should involve two disjoint, but
possibly entangled factors. We argue that these CFTs would be of a novel form,

propose that a holographic dual description of de Sitter space would involve a
pure entangled state in a product of two of our unconventional CFTs associated

set, such that one is a homomorphism for the other, coincide and, moreover, the
resulting monoid is commutative. This argument immediately gives a proof of the
commutativity of the higher homotopy groups. A reformulation of this argument
in the language of higher categories is: suppose we have a one object, one
arrow 2-category, then its $Hom$-set is a commutative monoid. A similar
argument due to A.Joyal and R.Street shows that a one object, one arrow
tricategory is `the same' as a braided monoidal category.
  In this paper we begin to investigate how one can extend this argument to
arbitrary dimension. We provide a simple categorical scheme which allows us to
formalise the Eckman-Hilton type argument in terms of the calculation of left
Kan extensions in an appropriate 2-category. Then we apply this scheme to the
case of $n$-operads in the author's sense and classical symmetric operads. We
demonstrate that there exists a functor of symmetrisation $Sym_n$ from a
certain subcategory of $n$-operads to the category of symmetric operads such
that the category of one object, one arrow, . . ., one $(n-1)$-arrow algebras
of $A$ is isomorphic to the category of algebras of $Sym_n(A)$. Under some mild
conditions, we present an explicit formula for $Sym_n(A)$ which involves taking

following short exact sequence $$0\to V_n\to \pic (\mathbb{Z} C_{p^n})\to \cl
\mathbb{Q} (\zeta_{n-1})\times \pic (\mathbb{Z} C_{p^{n-1}})\to 0$$ where
$\zeta_{n-1}$ is a primitive $p^n$-th root of unity. The group $V_n$ that
injects into $\pic \mathbb{Z} C_{p^n}\cong\tilde{K}_0\mathbb{Z} C_{p^n}$, is a
canonical quotient of an in some sense simpler group $\mathcal{V}_n$. Both
groups split in a ``positive'' and ``negative'' part. While $V_n^-$ is well
understood there is still no complete information on $V_n^+$. Kervaire and
Murthy showed that $K_0 \Z C_{p^n}$ and $V_n$ are tightly connected to class
groups of cyclotomic fields. They conjectured that $V_n^+\cong (\mathbb{Z}/p^n
\mathbb{Z})^{r(p)}$, where $r(p)$ is the index of regularity of the prime $p$

primes which also gives us the structure of $\cl^{(p)} \mathbb{Q}(\z_{n-1})$ as

become unstable to the induced nucleation of dislocations in the defect-free

supply and demand in a single market with one supplier, one buyer, and one kind
of commodity is developed. Unlike the cob-web dynamic theories with adaptive
expectations that are made up of deterministic difference equations, the new
model is cast in the form of stochastic differential equations. The
stochasticity is due to random disturbances (""input"") to endogenous variables.
The disturbances are assumed to be stationary to the second order with zero
means and given covariance functions. Two particular versions of the model with
different endogenous variables are considered. The first version involves
supply, demand, and price. In the second version the stock of commodity is
added. Covariance functions and variances of the endogenous variables
(""output"") are obtained in terms of the spectral theory of stochastic
stationary processes. The impact of both deterministic parameters of the model
and the random input on the stochastic output is analyzed and new conditions of
chaotic instability are found. If these conditions are met, the endogenous
variables undergo unbounded chaotic oscillations. As a result, the market that
would be stable if undisturbed loses stability and collapses. This phenomenon
cannot be discovered even in principle in terms of any cobweb deterministic
model.

basics of implementing quantum algorithms. We describe how qubits are realized
and controlled with RF pulses, their internal interactions, and gradient
fields. A peculiarity of NMR is that the internal interactions (given by the
internal Hamiltonian) are always on. We discuss how they can be effectively
turned off with the help of a standard NMR method called ``refocusing''. Liquid
state NMR experiments are done at room temperature, leading to an extremely
mixed (that is, nearly random) initial state. Despite this high degree of
randomness, it is possible to investigate QIP because the relaxation time (the
time scale over which useful signal from a computation is lost) is sufficiently
long. We explain how this feature leads to the crucial ability of simulating a
pure (non-random) state by using ``pseudopure'' states. We discuss how the
``answer'' provided by a computation is obtained by measurement and how this
measurement differs from the ideal, projective measurement of QIP. We then give
implementations of some simple quantum algorithms with a typical experimental
result. We conclude with a discussion of what we have learned from NMR QIP so
far and what the prospects for future NMR QIP experiments are.
