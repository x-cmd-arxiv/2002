model for structure formation assumes an n=1 scale-invariant initial power
spectrum, most inflation models produce at least mild deviations from n=1.
Because the lever arm from the CMB normalization to galaxy scales is long, even
a small ``tilt'' can have important implications for galactic observations.
Here we calculate the COBE-normalized power spectra for several well-motivated
models of inflation and compute implications for the substructure content and
central densities of galaxy halos. Using an analytic model, normalized against
N-body simulations, we show that while halos in the standard (n=1) model are
overdense by a factor of ~6 compared to observations, several of our example
inflation+LCDM models predict halo densities well within the range of
observations, which prefer models with n ~ 0.85. We go on to use a
semi-analytic model (also normalized against N-body simulations) to follow the
merger histories of galaxy-sized halos and track the orbital decay, disruption,
and evolution of the merging substructure. Models with n ~0.85 predict a factor
of ~3 fewer subhalos at a fixed circular velocity than the standard $n = 1$
case. Although this level of reduction does not resolve the ``dwarf satellite
problem'', it does imply that the level of feedback required to match the
observed number of dwarfs is sensitive to the initial power spectrum. Finally,
the fraction of galaxy-halo mass that is bound up in substructure is consistent
with limits imposed by multiply imaged quasars for all models considered: f_sub
> 0.01 even for an effective tilt of n ~0.8.We conclude that, at their current
level, lensing constraints of this kind do not provide strong limits on the
primordial power spectrum.

tracks the evolution of the interstellar medium gas mass, metallicity, and
temperature. Modeling the star formation rate as a Schmidt law with a
temperature-dependent efficiency, we find that intermittent episodes of star
formation are common in moderate-size ellipticals. Our model is applicable in
the case in which the thermalization time from SN is sufficiently long that
spatial variations are relatively unimportant, an appropriate assumption for
the empirical parameters adopted here. The departure from a standard scenario
of passive evolution implies significantly younger luminosity-weighted ages for
the stellar populations of low-mass galaxies at moderate redshifts, even though
the more physically meaningful mass-weighted ages are changed only slightly.
Secondary bursts of star formation also lead to a natural explanation of the
large scatter in the NUV-optical relation observed in clusters at moderate
redshift and account for the population of E+A galaxies that display a
spheroidal morphology. As the late-time formation of stars in our model is due
to the gradual cooling of the interstellar medium, which is heated to
temperatures ~1 keV by the initial burst of supernovae, our conclusions do not
rely on any environmental effects or external mechanisms. Furthermore, a simple
estimate of the X-ray emission from this supernova heated gas leads to an L_X
vs L_B correlation that is in good agreement with observed values. Thus
feedback processes may be essential to understanding the observed properties of
early-type galaxies from the optical to the X-ray.

instability of solids that have settled to the midplane of a circumstellar
disk. Vertical shear between the gas and a subdisk of solids induces turbulent
mixing which inhibits gravitational instability. Working in the limit of small,
well-coupled particles, we find that the mixing becomes ineffective when the
surface density ratio of solids to gas exceeds a critical value. Solids in
excess of this precipitation limit can undergo midplane gravitational
instability and form planetesimals. However, this saturation effect typically
requires increasing the local ratio of solid to gaseous surface density by
factors of two to ten times cosmic abundances, depending on the exact
properties of the gas disk. We discuss existing astrophysical mechanisms for
augmenting the ratio of solids to gas in protoplanetary disks by such factors,
and investigate a particular process that depends on the radial variations of
orbital drift speeds induced by gas drag. This mechanism can concentrate
millimeter sized chondrules to the supercritical surface density in < few x
10^6 years, a suggestive timescale for the disappearance of dusty disks in T
Tauri stars. We discuss the relevance of our results to some outstanding

to unsaturated inverse Comptonization of external soft photons and to the
energy needed to ignite both nuclear reactions. Assuming matter composition of
90% Hydrogen and 10% He, it is shown that, close to the border of this region,
neutron production is essentially from ^{4}He breakup. Close to the horizon,
the contribution from p(p, n{pi}^+)p to the neutron production is comparable to
that from the breakup. It is shown that the viscosity generated by the
collisions of the accreting matter with the neutrons may drive stationary
accretion, for accretion rates below a critical value. In this case, solution
to the disk equations is double-valued and for both solutions protons
overnumber the pairs. It is claimed that these solutions may mimic the states
of high and low luminosity observed in Cygnus X-1 and related sources. This

peculiar behavior of the viscosity parameter alpha with the ion temperature
that may intermittently switch accretion off or by the impossibility of a

Comparison with the magnetic eddy diffusivity derived from the sunspot decay

temperature. The cooler component (kT ~ 0.8-1 keV) fills a small volume
compared to the hotter component (kT ~ 1.6-2.5 keV), it is confined to the
radio arms rather than being associated with the potential well of the central
cD and is probably structured in blobs with typical sizes smaller than a few

the hotter ambient gas. Since the cool gas is observed only in those regions of
M87 where we have evidence of radio halos our results favor models in which
magnetic fields play a role in suppressing heat conduction. The entropy of the
cool blobs is in general smaller than that of the hot phase gas thus cool blobs

the leading peak above ~5 GeV consistently for all three pulsars, even though
this is not the case over the entire energy range of EGRET, i.e. above ~100
MeV. We present the results of Monte Carlo simulations of electromagnetic
cascades in a pulsar magnetosphere within a single-polar-cap scenario with
rotationally-induced propagation effects of the order of v/c (where v is the
local corotation velocity). We find that even in the case of nearly aligned
rotators with spin periods of P ~ 0.1 s rotation may lead to asymmetric (with
respect to the magnetic axis) magnetic photon absorption which in turn leads to
asymmetric gamma-ray pulse profiles. The resulting features - softer spectrum
of the leading peak and the dominance of the trailing peak above ~5 GeV - agree
qualitatively with the EGRET data of the bright gamma-ray pulsars.

that a uniform heating led to an unreasonably large plasma column depth along

footpoint-heated model loop (with a minor cool component) yields more
acceptable physical solutions. We revisit the analysis of the same loop system,

  Physics: Kolkata",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Radio emission from X-ray binary systems (XRBs) has developed in recent years
from being peculiar phenomenon to being recognised as an ubiquitous property of
several classes of XRBs. In this scenario the synchrotron emission is
interpreted as the radiative signature of jet-like outflows, some or all of
which may possess relativistic bulk motion. We have analysed a collection of
quasi-simultaneous radio/X-ray observations of Black Holes in the Low/Hard
X-ray state, finding evidence of a clear correlation between their fluxes over
many orders of magnitude in luminosity. Given that the correlation extends down
to GX 339-4 and V404 Cyg in quiescence, we can confidently assert that even at
accretion rates as low as ~ 10^{-5} dot{m}_{Edd} a powerful jet is being
formed. The normalisation of the correlation is very similar across a sample of
nine sources, implying that it is nearly independent of jet inclination angle.
Remarkably, V 404 Cyg is the second source (after GX 339-4) to show the
correlation S_{radio} proportional to S_{X}^{+0.7} from quiescent level up to
close to the High/Soft state transition. Moreover, assuming the same physics
and accretion:outflow coupling for all of these systems, the simplest
interpretation for the observed scenario is that outflows in Low/Hard state do
not have large bulk Lorentz factors.

SAX J1808.4-3658 mostly originates in the Comptonization process in a
relatively optical thin hot region (with an optical depth $\tau_0$ around 4 and
temperature is around 20 keV). Such a transparent region does not prevent us
from detecting coherent X-ray pulsation due to hot spots on the NS surface.
When the characteristic scattering time in the region is of order of inverse
rotational frequency omega or higher then the amplitude of the harmonic
oscillation decays exponentially with (tau_0 x omega). We give a precise model
for the loss of modulation, such suppression of the QPO amplitude due to
scattering can explain the disappearance of kHz QPOs with increasing QPO
frequency. We also formulate general conditions under which the millisecond
X-ray pulsation can be detected in LMXBs.
  We demonstrate that the observed soft phase lag of the pulsed emission is a
result of the downscattering of the hard X-ray photons in the relatively cold
material near the NS surface. In the framework of this downscattering model we
propose a method to determine the atmosphere density in that region from
soft-lag measurements.

dramatic, particularly below 228 A. We also find lower fluxes in the He I

photoionization models. We show that for the dwarf O star grid, He I 5876/H
beta decreases between Z = 1 and twice solar in a similar manner to
observations (e.g. Bresolin et al. 1999) due to the increased effect of line
blanketing. We therefore suggest that a lowering of the upper mass limit at
high abundances is not required to explain the observations. For the case of an
instantaneous burst, we plot the softness parameter ""eta prime"" against the
abundance indicator R_23. The new models are coincident with the data of
Bresolin et al. (1999), particularly during the W-R phase, unlike previous

For systems with one atom per unit cell, it amounts to a simple renormalization
of the spin-wave spectrum. This renormalization greatly improves the agreement

density mode has a magneto-roton minimum at finite wavevectors, at a few times
10^6 cm^{-1} for parallel fields of order 1-10 Tesla, only in the direction
perpendicular to the in-plane magnetic field, while the mode energy increases
monotonously with wavevector parallel to the in-plane magnetic field. When the
in-plane magnetic field is strong enough (well above 10 Tesla),we speculate
that this roton minimum may reach zero energy, suggesting a possible second
order phase transition to a state with broken translational and spin
symmetries. We discuss the possibility for observing such parallel
field-induced quantum phase transitions. We also derive an expression for the
dielectric function within the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximation and
include screening effects in our magnetoplasmon calculation. We discuss several
exotic symmetry-broken phases that may be stable in finite parallel fields, and
propose that the transport anisotropy, observed recently in parallel field
experiments, may be due to the formation of a skyrmion stripe phase predicted
in our theory. Our predicted anisotropic finite wavevector suppression, perhaps
even a mode-softening leading to the quantum phase transition to the
anisotropic phase, in the collective spin excitation mode of the wide well

found the now familiar critical phenomena, namely scaling of the black hole
mass with a critical exponent and continuous self-similarity at the threshold
of black hole formation. Using the equivalence of an irrotational stiff fluid
to a massless scalar field, we construct the critical solution as a scalar
field solution by making a self-similarity ansatz. We find evidence that this
solution has exactly one growing perturbation mode; both the mode and the
critical exponent, gamma ~ 0.94, derived from its eigenvalue agree with those
measured in perfect fluid collapse simulations. We explain why this solution is
seen as a critical solution in stiff fluid collapse but not in scalar field
collapse, and conversely why the scalar field critical solution is not seen in
stiff fluid collapse, even though the two systems are locally equivalent.

models of differentially rotating stars to first post-Newtonian order. The
rotation law is specified by the specific angular momentum distribution j(m),

angular momentum. The method is then used to compute models of the nascent
neutron stars resulting from the accretion induced collapse of white dwarfs.
The result shows that the ratios of kinetic energy to gravitational binding

with different mass components in general relativity, within the
Isenberg-Wilson-Mathews approximation. We consider both cases of synchronized
rotation and irrotational motion. A polytropic equation of state is used with
the adiabatic index gamma=2. The computations have been performed for the
following combinations of stars: (M/R)_{star 1} vs. (M/R)_{star 2} = 0.12 vs.
(0.12, 0.13, 0.14), 0.14 vs. (0.14, 0.15, 0.16), 0.16 vs. (0.16, 0.17, 0.18),
and 0.18 vs. 0.18, where (M/R) denotes the compactness parameter of infinitely
separated stars of the same baryon number. It is found that for identical mass
binary systems there is no turning point of the binding energy (ADM mass)
before the end point of the sequence (mass shedding point) in the irrotational
case, while there is one before the end point of the sequence (contact point)
in the synchronized case. On the other hand, in the different mass case, the
sequence ends by the tidal disruption of the less massive star (mass shedding
point). It is then more difficult to find a turning point in the ADM mass.
Furthermore, we find that the deformation of each star depends mainly on the
orbital separation and the mass ratio and very weakly on its compactness. On
the other side, the decrease of the central energy density depends on the
compactness of the star and not on that of the companion.

corresponds to QCD with minus two quark flavors and is known as the bermion

describes the scale evolution of the running coupling in the Schrodinger
functional scheme. We develop a suitable algorithm for the simulation of O(a)
improved bermions and compare its performance with unimproved bermions and full

of the step scaling function from lattice simulations when improvement is used.
Our results are compared to the unimproved bermion and dynamical fermion cases,

  We also examine the step scaling function with massive quarks in the bermion
model. According to the Appelquist-Carazzone theorem the contributions from
matter fields are expected to vanish for large masses, such that the step
scaling function converges to the pure gauge theory case. If one wants to
connect non-perturbatively different effective theories with different numbers
of active quarks over flavor thresholds, lattice artefacts should be reasonably
small. In order to test the feasibility of such a method, we investigate the
step scaling function and its lattice artefacts for several values of the mass.

diffractive scattering, with the marked instanton-size scale <rho>
approximately 0.5 fm being reflected in the conspicuous ``geometrization'' of
soft QCD. As an explicit step in this direction, the known instanton-induced
cross sections in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) are transformed into the
familiar colour dipole picture, which represents an intuitive framework for
investigating the transition from hard to soft physics in DIS at small x_{Bj}.
The simplest instanton (I) process without final-state gluons is studied first.
With the help of lattice results, the q bar{q}-dipole size r is carefully
increased towards hadronic dimensions. Unlike perturbative QCD, one now
observes a competition between two crucial length scales: the dipole size r and
the size rho of the background instanton that is sharply localized around <rho>
approximately 0.5 fm. For r exceeding <rho>, the dipole cross section indeed
saturates towards a geometrical limit, proportional to the area pi <rho>^2,
subtended by the instanton. In case of final-state gluons, lattice data are
crucially used to support the emerging picture and to assert the range of
validity of the underlying I bar{I}-valley approach. As function of an
appropriate energy variable, the resulting dipole cross section turns out to be
sharply peaked at the sphaleron mass in the soft regime. The general
geometrical features remain like in the case without gluons.

show that the (2+1)-dimensional Gauss-Mainardi-Codazzi equation which describes
the deformation (motion) of surfaces is the exact reduction of the
Yang-Mills-Higgs-Bogomolny and Self-Dual Yang-Mills equations. On the basis of
this observation, we suggest that the (2+1)-dimensional Gauss-Mainardi-Codazzi

chemistry of cellulose decomposition is examined, with reference to evidence
from experimental studies indicating that char formation is a low activation
energy exothermal process and volatilization is a high activation energy
endothermal process. The thermohydrolysis chemistry at the core of the primary
competition is described. Essentially, the competition is between two
nucleophiles, a molecule of water and an -OH group on C_6 of an end glucosyl
cation, to form either a reducing chain fragment with the propensity to undergo
the bond-forming reactions that ultimately form char or a
levoglucosan-end-fragment that depolymerizes to volatile products. The results
of this analysis suggest that promotion of char formation under thermal stress
can actually increase the production of flammable volatiles. Thus we would like
to convey an important safety message in this paper: in some situations where
heat and mass transfer is restricted in cellulosic materials, such as
furnishings, insulation, and stockpiles, the use of char-promoting treatments
for fire retardation may have the effect of increasing the risk of flaming
combustion.
