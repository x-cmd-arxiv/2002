stellar object GSS 30 IRS1 (L=25L_sun) in the rho Ophiuchus core, observed with
the infrared spectrometer (ISAAC) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT-UT1). Strong
line emission from the ro-vibrational transitions of 12CO and 13CO is detected.
In total more than 40 distinct lines are seen in the covered region. The line
emission is spatially extended and detected up to 2"" = 320 AU from the central
source but is spectrally unresolved (Delta v < 30 km/s). This is the first time
strong emission in the fundamental ro-vibrational band from CO has been
observed from an embedded young stellar object. The line fluxes were modeled
using a 1-dimensional full radiative transfer code, which shows that the
emission is fully consistent with a gas in LTE at a single well constrained
temperature (T=515+/-5 K). Furthermore, the ratios between lines from the two
detected isotopic species of CO show that the 12CO lines must be optically
thick. However, this is inconsistent with the observed spatial extent of the
emission, since this implies such low CO column densities that the lines are
optically thin. A likely solution to the discrepancy is that the lines are
emitted by a smaller more dense region and then scattered in the bipolar cavity
present around the central star. This gives a rough estimate of the total
molecular gas mass of 1-100 M_earth and a physical extent of ~20-100 AU. We
propose that the most likely origin of the line emission is post-shocked gas in
a dense dissociative accretion shock from the inner 10-50 AU of a circumstellar
disk. The presence of a shock capable of dissociating molecules in the disk
will have implications for the chemical evolution of disks around young low
mass stars.

them harbor a single disturbed nucleus and are therefore in the later stages of
a merger. Seyfert galaxies (especially those of type 1), warm ULIGs
(f_{25}/f_{60} > 0.2) and the more luminous systems (> 10^{12.5} L_sun) all
show a strong tendency to be advanced mergers with a single nucleus. An
analysis of the surface brightness profiles of the host galaxies in
single-nucleus sources reveals that about 73% of the R and K' surface
brightness profiles are fit adequately by an elliptical-like R^{1/4}-law. These
elliptical-like 1-Jy systems have luminosities, half-light radii, and R-band
axial ratio distribution that are similar to those of normal (inactive)
intermediate-luminosity ellipticals and follow with some scatter the same mu_e
- r_e relation. These elliptical-like hosts are most common among merger
remnants with Seyfert 1 nuclei (83%), Seyfert 2 optical characteristics (69%)
or mid-infrared (ISO) AGN signatures (80%). In general, the results from the
present study are consistent with the merger-driven evolutionary sequence
``cool ULIGs --> warm ULIGs --> quasars,'' although there are many exceptions.

remarkably close to the fundamental plane of early type galaxies. They populate
a wide range of the plane, are on average similar to L*-rotating ellipticals,
but are well offset from giant ellipticals and optically/UV bright, low-z
QSOs/radio galaxies. ULIRGs and local QSOs/radio galaxies are very similar in
their distributions of bolometric and extinction corrected near-IR
luminosities, but ULIRGs have smaller effective radii and velocity dispersions
than the local QSO/radio galaxy population. Hence, their host masses and
inferred black hole masses are correspondingly smaller. The latter are more
akin to those of local Seyfert galaxies. ULIRGs thus resemble local QSOs in
their near-IR and bolometric luminosities because they are (much more)
efficiently forming stars and/or feeding their black holes, and not because
they have QSO-like, very massive black holes. We conclude that ULIRGs as a
class cannot evolve into optically bright QSOs. They will more likely become
quiescent, moderate mass field ellipticals or, when active, might resemble the

Supernova Search (NGSS) project. This luminous, slow-declining (Delta m_{15}

First, it occurred in an extremely low luminosity host galaxy that was not
visible in the template images, nor in initial subsequent deep imaging.
Secondly, the photometric and spectral properties of this supernova indicate
that it very likely was similar to the subclass of Type Ia supernovae whose
prototype is SN 1999aa. This paper presents the BVRI and J_{s} HK_{s}
lightcurves of SN 1999aw (through 100 days past maximum light), as well as
several epochs of optical spectra. From these data we calculate the bolometric
light curve, and give estimates of the luminosity at maximum light and the
initial ^{56}Ni mass. In addition, we present deep BVI images obtained recently
with the Baade 6.5-meter telescope at Las Campanas Observatory which reveal the
remarkably low-luminosity host galaxy.

combined gas dynamics and cosmic ray (CR, hereafter) diffusion-convection code
has been developed. The particle injection is followed numerically by filtering
the diffusive flux of suprathermal particles across the shock to the upstream
region according to a velocity-dependent transparency function that controls
the fraction of leaking particles. We have studied CR injection and
acceleration efficiencies during the evolution of CR modified planar shocks for
a wide range of initial shock Mach numbers, $M_0$, assuming a Bohm-like
diffusion coefficient. The injection process is very efficient when the
subshock is strong, leading to fast and significant modification of the shock
structure. As the CR pressure increases, the subshock weakens and the injection
rate decreases accordingly, so that the subshock does not disappear. Although
some fraction of the particles injected early in the evolution continue to be
accelerated to ever higher energies, the postshock CR pressure reaches an
approximate time-asymptotic value due to a balance between fresh
injection/acceleration and advection/diffusion of the CR particles away from
the shock. We conclude that the injection rates in strong parallel shocks are
sufficient to lead to rapid nonlinear modifications to the shock structures and
that self-consistent injection and time-dependent simulations are crucial to
understanding the non-linear evolution of CR modified shocks.

Radial and rotation velocities have been measured by fits to the H-alpha

broadening of an observed spectrum has produced a relationship between H-alpha
FWHM and rotation speed, which we use to infer rotation speeds for the entire
sample by measurement of the H-alpha emission line. We find 3 ultra-fast
rotators (UFRs, vsini > 100km/s), and 8 stars with 30 < vsini < 100 km/s. The
UFRs have variable emission. Cross-correlation velocities measured for
ultra-fast rotators (UFRs) are shown to depend on rotation speed and the
filtering used. The radial velocity dispersion of the sample is 17 km/s. A new
double emission line spectroscopic binary with a period of 3.55 days has been
discovered, and another known one is in the sample. Three other objects are
suspected spectroscopic binaries, and at least six are visual doubles. The only
star in the sample observed to have significant lithium is a known TW Hya
Association member, TWA 8A. These results show that there are a number of young
(< 10^8 yr) and very young (< 10^7 yr) low mass stars in the immediate solar
neighbourhood. The H-alpha activity strength does not depend on rotation speed.
Our fast rotators are less luminous than similarly fast rotators in the
Pleiades. They are either younger than the Pleiades, or gained angular momentum
in a different way.

electron-positron pairs that are injected beyond the pair production front. We
solve the one-dimensional Poisson equation along a magnetic field line, both
analytically and numerically, for a given current density incorporating effects
of returning positrons, and we obtain the conditions for the electric-field
screening. The formula which we obtained gives the screening distance and the
return flux for given primary current density, field geometry and pair creation
rate at the pair production front.
  If the geometrical screening is not possible, for instance, on field lines
with a super-Goldreich-Julian current, then the electric field at the pair
production front is constrained to be fairly small in comparison with values
expected typically by the conventional polar cap models. This is because (1)
positive space charge by pair polarization is limited to a small value, and (2)
returning of positrons leave pair electrons behind. A previous belief that pair
creation with a pair density higher than the Goldreich-Julian density
immediately screens out the electric field is unjustified at least for for a
super Goldreich-Julian current density. We suggest some possibilities to
resolve this difficulty.

we conclude that the quiescent accretion disk of IP Peg has a complex
structure. There are also explicit indications of spiral shocks. The Doppler
maps and the variations of the peak separation of the emission lines confirm
this interpretation. We have detected that all the emission lines show a rather
considerable asymmetry of their wings varying with time. The wing asymmetry
shows quasi-periodic modulations with a period much shorter than the orbital
one. This indicates the presence of an emission source in the binary rotating
asynchronously with the binary system. We also have found that the brightness
of the bright spot changes considerably during one orbital period. The spot
becomes brightest at an inferior conjunction, whereas it is almost invisible
when it is located on the distant half of the accretion disk. Probably, this
phenomenon is due to an anisotropic radiation of the bright spot and an eclipse
of the bright spot by the outer edge of the accretion disk.

solving the angle- and frequency-dependent radiative transfer equation in two
space dimensions assuming axisymmetry, and hence the radiative equilibrium
temperature in the disk and halo is determined simultaneously. The disk is
effectively heated by the scattering and reprocessing of stellar radiation
through the halo. The large mid- to far-infrared excess originates from the
photosphere of the warmed disk, resulting in a flat spectrum, as observed. The
halo which we consider is observed as a compact reflection nebula, and is
discriminated from extended, disk-like envelopes around flat-spectrum T Tauri
stars. We show that the overall spectral shape of flat-spectrum T Tauri stars
can be reproduced by the present disk-halo model.

investigated. The simulations show the formation of a comet-like head-tail

including the correlation effects via a Jastrow factor, an approximate
expression of the one-electron reduced density matrix. Applying the latter to
the homogeneous electron gas, an analytic expression of the correlation kinetic

deduced from its kinetic contribution inverting a standard procedure. At

knowledge representation and reasoning. Previous results show that nested logic
programs can be transformed into standard (unnested) disjunctive logic programs
in an elementary way, applying the negation as failure operator to body
literals only. This is of great practical relevance since it allows us to
evaluate nested logic programs by means of off-the-shelf disjunctive logic
programming systems, like DLV. However, it turns out that this straightforward
transformation results in an exponential blow-up in the worst-case, despite the
fact that complexity results indicate that there is a polynomial translation
among both formalisms. In this paper, we take up this challenge and provide a
polynomial translation of logic programs with nested expressions into
disjunctive logic programs. Moreover, we show that this translation is modular
and (strongly) faithful. We have implemented both the straightforward as well
as our advanced transformation; the resulting compiler serves as a front-end to
DLV and is publicly available on the Web.

states only a sterile admixture of 16% is allowed at 99% CL, while a bound of

$G/K$. Vector fields on $G/K$ whose horizontal lifts to $G$ are tangent to the
Cartan embedding of $G/K$ into $G$ are called \emph{flat}. When $G$ is simple
and simply connected, it is shown that every element of $\X(G/K)^K$ is flat if
and only if $K$ is semisimple. The gradients of the fundamental characters of
$G$ are shown to generate all conjugation-invariant vector fields on $G$. These
results are applied in the case of the adjoint representation of $G =
\SL(2,\C)$ to construct a conjugation invariant differential operator whose
kernel furnishes a harmonic decomposition of $\C[G]$.

dimension and has nice permanence properties; in particular, it behaves well
with respect to direct sums, quotients, inductive limits, unitization and

invariant under stabilization. It turns out that the decomposition rank can be
finite only for strongly quasidiagonal C^*-algebras and that it is closely
related to the classification program.
