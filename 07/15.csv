dark matter halos. If the WIMP is a neutralino, with an annihilation
cross-section predicted in minimal SUSY models for the lightest stable relic
particle, the central cusps and dense substructure seen in simulated halos may
produce a substantial flux of energetic gamma rays. We derive expressions for
the relative flux from such events in simple halos with various density
profiles, and use these to calculate the relative flux produced within a large
volume as a function of redshift. This flux peaks when the first halos
collapse, but then declines as small halos merge into larger systems of lower
density. Simulations show that halos contain a substantial amount of dense
substructure, left over from the incomplete disruption of smaller halos as they
merge together. We calculate the contribution to the flux due to this
substructure, and show that it can increase the annihilation signal
substantially. Overall, the present-day flux from annihilation events may be an
order of magnitude larger than predicted by previous calculations. We discuss
the implications of these results for current and future gamma-ray experiments.

surprisingly low but the derived magnetic field of 1.6 G close to that
expected.

of the cluster environment around these objects (the amplitude of the
galaxy-galaxy spatial covariance function, Bgg) to search for indirect evidence
of a dense intracluster medium (ICM). This is done by searching for confinement
and distortions of the radio structure that are correlated with Bgg.
Correlations between physical size and hot spot placement with Bgg show
evidence for an ICM only at z < 0.4 and there are no correlations at z > 0.4,
suggesting an epoch of z ~ 0.4 for the formation of an ICM in these Abell
richness class 0-1, FR2-selected clusters. X-ray selected clusters at
comparable redshifts, which contain FR1 type sources exclusively, are
demonstrably richer than the FR2-selected clusters found in this study. The
majority of the radio sources with high Bgg values at z < 0.4 can be described
as ``fat doubles'' or intermediate FR2/FR1s. The lack of correlation between
Bgg and bending angle or Bgg and lobe length asymmetry suggests that these
types of radio source distortion are caused by something other than interaction
with a dense ICM. Thus, a large bending angle cannot be used as an unambiguous
indicator of a rich cluster around powerful radio sources. These results
support the hypothesis made in Paper 1 that cluster quasars fade to become
FR2s, then FR1s, on a timescale of 0.9 Gyrs (for H0 = 50 km s^-1 Mpc^-1).

is composed of 43 BL Lac objects which have a relatively continuous
distribution of peak frequencies. Under the assumption that the observed
emission lines are photoionized by the central accretion disk, we use the line
luminosities to estimate the accretion luminosities and hence accretion rates.
We find that low frequency-peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs) span a wide range of
accretion rates, whereas high frequency-peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs) cover a
more restricted range of lower values. There appears to be a continuous
distribution of accretion rates between the two subclasses of BL Lac objects.
We find that the peak frequency of the SED, $\pknu$, correlates with the
accretion rate, approximately with the form $\pknu\propto \Lambda^{-3}$ in HBLs
and $\pknu \propto \Lambda^{-0.25}$ in LBLs, where $\Lambda \equiv L_{\rm
lines}/c^2$. The peak luminosity of the SED is also correlated with $\Lambda$.
These results suggest that the accretion rate influences the shape of the SED
in BL Lac objects. They also support models which couple the jet and the
accretion disk. We present a physical scenario to account for the empirical
trends.

the first 2"" and surprisingly does not show a separate low-velocity component
in contrast to earlier observations. The systemic radial outflow velocity of
the blueshifted lobe is typically 50% larger than that of the redshifted one

been seen before on larger scales, our high spatial resolution observations
suggest that they are intrinsic to the ""central engine"" rather than effects of
the star's immediate environment. Temporal variations of the bipolar jet's
outflow velocities appear to occur on timescales of a few years. They have
combined to produce a 55% increase in the velocity asymmetry between the two
lobes over the past decade. In the red lobe estimated mass flux and momentum
flux values are around one half and one third of those for the blue lobe,
respectively. The mass outflow to mass accretion rate is 0.05, the former being

precisely, rings traced by HCO, CO and HII regions are nested, with the HCO

measurements of magnetization, were carried out on Ga1-xMnxAs epilayers grown
by low temperature molecular beam epitaxy, and subsequently annealed under
various conditions. We observe a large enhancement of ferromagnetism when the
samples are annealed at an optimal temperature, typically about 280 0C. Such
optimal annealing leads to an increase of Curie temperature, accompanied by an
increase of both the conductivity and the saturation magnetization. A decrease
of the coercive field and of magnetoresistivity is also observed for Ga1-xMnxAs
annealed at optimal conditions. We suggest that the experimental results
reported in this paper are related to changes in the domain structure of
Ga1-xMnxAs.

effects of impurity atoms (boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, phosporus,

method. The matrix elements in momentum space were used to calculate real-space
properties: onsite parameters, partial densities of states, and local charges.
In impurity atoms that are empirically known to be embrittler (N and O) we
found that the 2s orbital is bound to the impurity and therefore does not
participate in the covalent bonding. In contrast, the corresponding 2s orbital
is found to be delocalized in the cohesion enhancers (B and C). Each of these
impurity atoms is found to acquire a net negative local charge in NiAl
irrespective of whether they sit in the Ni or Al site. The embrittler therefore
reduces the total number of electrons available for covalent bonding by
removing some of the electrons from the neighboring Ni or Al atoms and
localizing them at the impurity site. We show that these correlations also hold
for silicon, phosporus, and sulfur.

start by showing that generalizations of existing answer set approaches to

specify some informal yet intuitive criteria and propose a semantical framework
for preference handling that is more suitable for defining well-founded
semantics for ordered logic programs. The suitability of the new approach is
convinced by the fact that many attractive properties are satisfied by our
semantics. In particular, our semantics is still correct with respect to
various existing answer sets semantics while it successfully overcomes the
weakness of their generalization to well-founded semantics. Finally, we
indicate how an existing preferred well-founded semantics can be captured
within our semantical framework.

that the variance of their sampling distributions be calculated in addition to

introduce the concept of statistical errors of confidence limits and argue that
not only should limits be calculated but also their errors in order to
represent the results of the analysis to the fullest. We show that comparison

complete genome. Our method is based on the probability measure representation
of a genome. We first demonstrate that these probability measures can be
modelled as recurrent iterated function systems (RIFS) consisting of four
contractive similarities. Our hypothesis is that the multifractal
characteristic of the probability measure of a complete genome, as captured by
the RIFS, is preserved in its reasonably long fragments. We compute the RIFS of
fragments of various lengths and random starting points, and compare with that
of the original sequence for recognition using the Euclidean distance. A
demonstration on five randomly selected organisms supports the above
hypothesis.

Prisoners' Dilemma. Multi-slit electron diffraction with each player's pure
strategy consisting of opening one of the two slits at his/her disposal are
essential features of the setup. Instead of entanglement the association of
waves with travelling material objects is suggested as another resource to play
quantum games.

A 301, 343 (2002)","10.1016/S0375-9601(02)01088-5",,"quant-ph",,"  We consider how randomness can be made to play a useful role in quantum
information processing - in particular, for decoherence control and the
implementation of quantum algorithms. For a two-level system in which the
decoherence channel is non-dissipative, we show that decoherence suppression is
possible if memory is present in the channel. Random switching between two
potentially harmful noise sources can then provide a source of stochastic
control. Such random switching can also be used in an advantageous way for the
implementation of quantum algorithms.
