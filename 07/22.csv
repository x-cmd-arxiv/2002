technique (SPH) designed to improve the realism with which galaxy formation can
be simulated. In situations where cooling leads to the coexistence of phases of
very different density and temperature, our method substantially reduces
artificial overcooling near phase boundaries, prevents the exclusion of hot gas
from the vicinity of cold ``clouds'', and allows relative motion of the two
phases at each point. We demonstrate the numerical stability of our scheme in
the presence of extremely steep density and temperature gradients, as well as
in strong accretion shocks and cooling flows. In addition, we present new
implementations of star formation and feedback which simulate the effect of
energy injection into multiphase gas more successfully than previous schemes.
Our feedback recipes deposit thermal energy separately in cold dense gas and
hot diffuse gas, and can explicitly reinject cold gas into the hot phase. They
make it possible to damp star formation effectively, to reheat cold gas, and to
drive outflows into the galaxy halo and beyond. We show feedback effects to be
strongest in small mass objects where much of the gas can be expelled. After
idealised tests, we carry out a first low resolution study of galaxy formation
in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. Feedback results in substantial and mass-dependent
reductions in the total baryonic mass gathered onto the final object as well as
in significant modulation of the star formation history.

processes that determine grain orientation in clouds of suprathermal cosmic
dust. The cross-section mechanism manifests itself when an ensemble of
suprathermal paramagnetic granules is placed in a magnetic field and is subject
to ultrasonic gas bombardment. The mechanism yields dust alignment whose
efficiency depends upon two factors: the geometric shape of the granules, and
the angle Phi between the magnetic line and the gas flow. We calculate the
quantitative measure of this alignment, and study its dependence upon the said
factors. It turns out that, irrelevant of the grain shape, the action of a flux
does not lead to alignment if Phi = arccos(1/sqrt{3}).

effect predominant for distant pulsars observed at low frequencies. Typically,
broadened pulses are analyzed to determine the amount of propagation-induced
pulse broadening, but with little interest in determining the undistorted pulse
shapes. In this paper we develop and apply a method that recovers both the
intrinsic pulse shape and the pulse broadening function that describes the
scattering of an impulse. The method resembles the CLEAN algorithm used in
synthesis imaging applications, although we search for the best pulse
broadening function, and perform a true deconvolution to recover intrinsic
pulse structre. As figures of merit to optimize the deconvolution, we use the
positivity and symmetry of the deconvolved result along with the mean square
residual and the number of points below a given threshold. Our method makes no
prior assumptions about the intrinsic pulse shape and can be used for a range
of scattering functions for the interstellar medium. It can therefore be
applied to a wider variety of measured pulse shapes and degrees of scattering
than the previous approaches. We apply the technique to both simulated data and
data from Arecibo observations.

a surface imaging code that can model the magnetic field of the star as a
non-potential current-carrying magnetic field. We find that a non-potential
field needs to be introduced in order to fit the dataset at this epoch. This
non-potential component takes the form of a strong unidirectional azimuthal
field of a similar strength to the radial field. This azimuthal field is
concentrated around the boundary of the dark polar spot recovered at the
surface of the star using Doppler imaging. As polarization signatures from the
center of starspots are suppressed, it is unclear whether or not this
non-potential component genuinely represents electric current at the unspotted
surface or whether it results from the preferred detection of horizontal field
in starspot penumbrae. This model contains 20% more energy than the
corresponding potential field model at the surface. This amount of free energy
drops to under 1% about 1R* above the photosphere.
  We use these surface maps to model the coronal structure of the star. The
mixed radial polarities at the pole in the surface maps support closed coronal
loops in the high latitude regions, indicating that a component of the X-ray
emission may originate in this area. Assuming that the field remains closed out
to 5R*, we find stable surfaces where prominences may form out to the observed

concentrated on the convergence, or on aperture measures of the shear. However,
as has become clear recently for the two-point statistics of cosmic shear, the
basic quantity that should be used is the correlation function: first, it is
much easier to measure from observational data, since it is immune against
complicated geometries of data fields; second, all other (linear) 2-pt
statistics can be expressed as integrals over the correlation function. The
situation is the same for the 3-pt statistics. However, in contrast to the 2-pt
correlation function, the invariants of the shear 3-pt correlation function
have not been employed yet. Here we consider the transformation properties of
the shear 3-pt correlation function under rotations. We show that there are
four complex linear combinations of components of the 3-pt correlation
function, which we shall call `natural components', since they are multiplied
just by a phase factor for arbitrary rotations, but do not mix. In particular,
their moduli are invariant under rotations and thus (non-linear) invariants of
the 3-pt correlation function. In terms of these natural components, the
invariance of the statistical properties of the shear field under parity
transformations are easily obtained. Our results do not apply only to cosmic
shear, but also to other quantities with the same mathematical properties --
that of a polar. For example, practically every relation derived here applies
also to the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

the visibility theory of Disney and Phillipps in terms of the detection rate

z~0.6 and one at redshift z~0.8, detected by ISOCAM in the Hubble Deep Field

spectroscopy. One of the galaxies is a massive spiral which possesses a very
large rotational velocity of 460 km/s and contains a mass of 10^12 M_solar
(within 20 kpc), significantly higher than the dynamical masses measured in
most other local and high redshift spirals. Two of the galaxies comprise a
counter-rotating interacting system, while the fourth is also a large spiral.
The observed galaxies are representative examples of the morphologies
encountered among ISOCAM galaxies. The mass-to-light (M /L_bol) ratios of
ISOCAM galaxies lie between those of local luminous IR galaxies and massive
spirals. We measure an offset of 1.6+/-0.3 mag in the rest frame B-band and of
0.7+/-0.3 mag in the rest frame I-band when we compare the four ISOCAM galaxies
to the local Tully-Fisher B and I-band relations. We conclude that the large IR
luminosity of the ISOCAM population results from a combination of large mass
and efficient triggering of star formation. Since ISOCAM galaxies contribute
significantly to the Cosmic Infrared Background our results imply that a
relatively small number of very massive and IR luminous objects contribute
significantly to the IR background and star formation activity near z~0.7.

The stellar density maps are derived, hinting that Sculptor possesses tidal
tails indicating interaction with the Milky Way. Contrary to previous studies
we cannot find any sign of breaks in the density profiles for the Carina and
Fornax dwarfs. The possible existence of tidal tails in Sculptor and of King
limiting radii in Fornax and Carina are used to derive global M/L ratios,
without using kinematic data. By matching those M/L ratios to kinematically
derived values we are able to constrain the orbital parameters of the three
dwarfs. Fornax cannot have M/L smaller than 3 and must be close to its
perigalacticon now. The other extreme is Sculptor that needs to be on an orbit
with an eccentricity bigger than 0.5 to be able to form tidal tails despite its
kinematic M/L.

their counterparts in classical default reasoning, they are weaker than
model-theoretic probabilistic entailment, and they are stronger than
probabilistic entailment under coherence. The new formalisms are useful
especially for handling probabilistic inconsistencies related to conditioning
on zero events. They can also be applied for probabilistic belief revision.
More generally, in the same spirit as a similar previous paper, this paper
sheds light on exciting new formalisms for probabilistic reasoning beyond the
well-known standard ones.

  rules; Updates",,,,"cs.PL cs.DB cs.LO",,"  The problem of integrating knowledge from multiple and heterogeneous sources
is a fundamental issue in current information systems. In order to cope with
this problem, the concept of mediator has been introduced as a software
component providing intermediate services, linking data resources and
application programs, and making transparent the heterogeneity of the
underlying systems. In designing a mediator architecture, we believe that an
important aspect is the definition of a formal framework by which one is able
to model integration according to a declarative style. To this purpose, the use
of a logical approach seems very promising. Another important aspect is the
ability to model both static integration aspects, concerning query execution,
and dynamic ones, concerning data updates and their propagation among the
various data sources. Unfortunately, as far as we know, no formal proposals for
logically modeling mediator architectures both from a static and dynamic point
of view have already been developed. In this paper, we extend the framework for
amalgamated knowledge bases, presented by Subrahmanian, to deal with dynamic
aspects. The language we propose is based on the Active U-Datalog language, and
extends it with annotated logic and amalgamation concepts. We model the sources
of information and the mediator (also called supervisor) as Active U-Datalog
deductive databases, thus modeling queries, transactions, and active rules,
interpreted according to the PARK semantics. By using active rules, the system
can efficiently perform update propagation among different databases. The
result is a logical environment, integrating active and deductive rules, to
perform queries and update propagation in an heterogeneous mediated framework.

  Engineering, The University of Melbourne","cs.DC cs.DS",,"  Clusters of computers have emerged as mainstream parallel and distributed
platforms for high-performance, high-throughput and high-availability
computing. To enable effective resource management on clusters, numerous
cluster managements systems and schedulers have been designed. However, their
focus has essentially been on maximizing CPU performance, but not on improving
the value of utility delivered to the user and quality of services. This paper
presents a new computational economy driven scheduling system called Libra,
which has been designed to support allocation of resources based on the users?
quality of service (QoS) requirements. It is intended to work as an add-on to
the existing queuing and resource management system. The first version has been
implemented as a plugin scheduler to the PBS (Portable Batch System) system.
The scheduler offers market-based economy driven service for managing batch
jobs on clusters by scheduling CPU time according to user utility as determined
by their budget and deadline rather than system performance considerations. The
Libra scheduler ensures that both these constraints are met within an O(n)
run-time. The Libra scheduler has been simulated using the GridSim toolkit to
carry out a detailed performance analysis. Results show that the deadline and
budget based proportional resource allocation strategy improves the utility of
the system and user satisfaction as compared to system-centric scheduling
strategies.

chiral models but has been omitted, enhances the competition between the chiral
symmerty breaking (chiSB) and CSC phase transition, and thereby makes the
thermodynamic potential have a shallow minimum over a wide range of values of
the correlated chiral and CSC order parameters. We find that when the vector
coupling is increased, the first order transition between the chiSB and CSC
phases becomes weaker, and the coexisting phase in which both the chiral and
color-gauge symmetry are dynamically broken comes to exisit over a wider range
of the density and temperature. We also show that there can exist two
endpoints, which are tricritical points in the chiral limit, along the critical
line of the first order transition in some range of values of the vector
coupling. Although our analysis is based on a simple model, the nontrivial
interplay between the chiSB and CSC phases induced by the vector interaction is
expected to be a universal phenomenon and might give a clue to understanding
results obtained with two-color QCD on the lattice.

It is found that both the critical temperature $T_c$ over which the formation

number of degrees of freedom at the time of PBH formation. In the standard
model, one can show that the lower bound on the mass of PBH known in the

constraint constructed in this work. We also pointed out the possibility that

$B_\mu$ = $(1+ \sigma \partial_m) A_\mu$ where $m$ goes to zero after

An exact treatment yields a structure $[1/k^2 + 2\mu^2/k^4]$ for the gluon

confinement in the instantaneous limit. This propagator was recently employed

basis for the ratio $\Lambda_{qcd} / \mu$ by employing the minimality condition
for the $integrated$ effective action $\Gamma$, up to the 2-loop level, using
the Cornwall-Jackiw formalism for composite operators. To that end the mass
function $m(p)$, determined via the Schwinger-Dyson equation (as a zero of the
functional derivative of $\Gamma$ w.r.t $S_F'$), acts as a feeder, and the
stationarity condition on $\Gamma$ as function of $\mu$ and $\alpha_s(\mu)$

simple results, namely phi_pi(x)=1 for the pion distribution amplitude, and
<k_perp^2> = -M <ubar u> / f_pi^2 for the second moment of the pion light-cone
wave function, where M is the constituent quark mass and f_pi is the pion decay
constant. After the QCD Gegenbauer evolution of the pion distribution amplitude
good end-point behavior is recovered, and a satisfactory agreement with the
analysis of the experimental data from CLEO is achieved. This allows us to
determine the momentum scale corresponding to our model calculation, which is
close to the value Q_0 = 313 MeV obtained earlier from the analogous analysis
of the pion parton distribution function. The value of <k_perp^2> is, after the
QCD evolution, around (400 MeV)^2. In addition, the model predicts a linear
integral relation between the pion distribution amplitude and the parton
distribution function of the pion, which holds at the leading-order QCD
evolution.

explained by a naive picture of successive independent Landau-Zener transitions
at avoided level crossing points. The effect of quantum interference is
essential. We define the number of Floquet states which have large overlap with
the initial state, and calculate its frequency dependence. The number of
Floquet states shows approximately linear dependence on the frequency, when the
frequency is small. Comparing the localization length in Floquet states and

and unbinned data. With binned data, one gets not only the fitted parameters
but also a measure of the goodness of fit. With unbinned data, currently, the
fitted parameters are obtained but no measure of goodness of fit is available.
This remains, to date, an unsolved problem in statistics. Using Bayes theorem
and likelihood ratios, we provide a method by which both the fitted quantities
and a measure of the goodness of fit are obtained for unbinned likelihood fits,
as well as errors in the fitted quantities. We provide an ansatz for
determining Bayesian a priori probabilities.

process. Starting from the initial tetrahedral cluster configuration, adding
new atoms to the system and absorbing its energy at each step, we find cluster
growing paths up to the cluster sizes of more than 100 atoms. We demonstrate
that in this way all known global minimum structures of the Lennard-Jonnes (LJ)
clusters can be found. Our method provides an efficient tool for the
calculation and analysis of atomic cluster structure. With its use we justify
the magic numbers sequence for the clusters of noble gases atoms and compare it
with experimental observations. We report the striking correspondence of the
peaks in the dependence on cluster size of the second derivative of the binding
energy per atom calculated for the chain of LJ-clusters based on the
icosahedral symmetry with the peaks in the abundance mass spectra
experimentally measured for the clusters of noble gases atoms. Our method
serves an efficient alternative to the global optimization techniques based on
the Monte-Carlo simulations and it can be applied for the solution of a broad
variety of problems in which atomic cluster structure is important.

approximation deformed jellium model we have calculated the binding energies
per atom, ionization potentials, deformation parameters and the optimized
values of the Wigner-Seitz radii for neutral and singly charged sodium clusters
with the number of atoms N <= 20. These characteristics are compared with the
results derived from the ab initio all-electron simulations of cluster
electronic and ionic structure based on the density functional theory as well
as on the post Hartree-Fock perturbation theory on many-electron correlation
interaction. The comparison performed demonstrates the great role of cluster
shape deformations in the formation cluster properties and the quite reasonable
level of applicability of the deformed jellium model.

multiple solutions to the coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) equations corresponding
to the Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model of cyclic polyenes, complete solutions to
the CCD equations for the A^{-}_{1g} states of benzene are obtained by means of
the homotopy method. By varying the value of the resonance integral beta from
-5.0 eV to -0.5 eV, we cover the so-called weakly, moderately, and strongly
correlated regimes of the model. For each value of beta 230 CCD solutions are
obtained. It turned out, however, that only for a few solutions a
correspondence with some physical states can be established. It has also been
demonstrated that, unlike for the standard methods of solving CCD equations,
some of the multiple solutions to the CCD equations can be attained by means of
the iterative process based on Pulay's direct inversion in the iterative
subspace (DIIS) approach.

influence of the characteristics, such as pipe length, diffusion, adsorption,
desorption and reaction rates on the transient properties of Single-File
Systems. The transient or the relaxation regime is the period in which the
system is evolving to equilibrium. We have studied the system when all the
sites are reactive and when only some of them are reactive. Comparisons between
Mean-Field predictions, Cluster Approximation predictions, and Monte Carlo
simulations for the relaxation time of the system are shown. We outline the
cases where Mean-Field analysis gives good results compared to Dynamic
Monte-Carlo results. For some specific cases we can analytically derive the
relaxation time. Occupancy profiles for different distribution of the sites
both for Mean-Field and simulations are compared. Different results for slow
and fast reaction systems and different distribution of reactive sites are
discussed.

allows us to either minimize the losses or optimize the distribution symmetry.

the group velocity of the fiber mode. The key to this proposal is: the
evanescent-like field of the thin fiber strongly couples with the surrounding
active medium, so that the EIT condition is met by the medium. We show how the
properties of the fiber mode is modified due to the EIT medium, both
numerically and analytically. We demonstrate that the group velocity of the new
modified fiber mode can be drastically reduced (approximately 44 m/sec) using
the coherently prepared orthohydrogen doped in a matrix of parahydrogen crystal
as the EIT medium.
