the Planck channels. We include relativistic corrections to the SZE, and
present a simple fitting formula for the SZE temperature dependence for the

problem for the estimation of the kinematic SZE component from Planck data,
since the key channel to estimate the kinematic component of the SZE, at 217
GHz, will be contaminated by a non-negligible thermal SZE component. The
imperfect subtraction of the SZE will have an effect on both the Planck cluster
catalogue and the recovered CMB map. In the cluster catalogue, the relativistic
corrections are not a major worry for the estimation of the total cluster flux
of the thermal SZE component, however, they must be included in the SZE
simulation when calculating the selection function and completeness level. The
power spectrum of the residual at 353 GHz, where the intensity of the thermal
SZE is maximum, does not contribute significantly to the power spectrum of the
CMB. We calculate the non-Gaussian signal due to the SZE residual in the 353
GHz CMB map using a simple Gaussianity estimator, and this estimator detects a
4.25-sigma non-Gaussian signal at small scales, which could be mistaken for a
primordial non-Gaussian signature. The other channels do not show any
significant departure from Gaussianity with our estimator.

radio-bright. We discuss the correlation of radio properties with the aspect
ratio of the bar and other measures of the bar strength. We introduce a new
measure of the bar strength, \Lambda, related to the quadrupole moment of the
bar's gravitational potential. The radio surface brightness I of the barred
galaxies in our sample is correlated with \Lambda, I \propto \Lambda^0.4+/-0.1,
and thus is highest in galaxies with a long bar where the velocity field is
distorted by the bar over a large fraction of the disc. In these galaxies, the
pattern of the regular field is significantly different from that in non-barred
galaxies. In particular, field enhancements occur upstream of the dust lanes
where the field lines are oriented at large angles to the bar's major axis.
Polarized radio emission seems to be a good indicator of large-scale
non-axisymmetric motions.

magnetic field lines are anchored is forced to dissipate the work being done
upon it, no matter how small the electrical resistivity. Numerical experiments
have clarified that dissipation is achieved through the formation of a
hierarchy of electrical current sheets. The probability distribution function
of the local winding of magnetic field lines is nearly Gaussian, with a width
of the order unity. The dissipation is highly irregular in space and time, but
the average level of dissipation is well described by a scaling law that is
independent of the electrical resistivity. If the boundary driving is suspended
for a period of time the magnetic dissipation rapidly drops to insignificant
levels, leaving the magnetic field in a nearly force-free state. Renewed
boundary driving leads to a quick return to dissipation levels compatible with
the rate of boundary work, with dissipation starting much more rapidly than
when starting from idealized initial conditions with a uniform magnetic field.
Application of these concepts to the solar corona lends credibility to
realistic, three-dimensional numerical models that predict emission measures,
coronal structures, and heating rates compatible with observations.

molecular gas in the Serpens region and to understand its relation with the
denser gas in the cloud cores, previously studied at high angular resolution.
All our molecular tracers show two main gas condensations, or sub-clumps,
roughly corresponding to the North-West and South-East clusters of
submillimeter continuum sources. We also carried out a kinematical study of the
Serpens cloud. The 13CO and C18O(1--0) maps of the centroid velocity show an
increasing, smooth gradient in velocity from East to West, which we think may
be caused by a global rotation of the Serpens molecular cloud whose rotation
axis is roughly aligned in the SN direction. Although it appears that the cloud
angular momentum is not sufficient for being dynamically important in the
global evolution of the cluster, the fact that the observed molecular outflows
are roughly aligned with it may suggest a link between the large-scale angular
momentum and the circumstellar disks around individual protostars in the
cluster. We also used the normalized centroid velocity difference as an infall
indicator. We find two large regions of the map, approximately coincident with
the SE and NW sub-clumps, which are undergoing an infalling motion. Although
our evidence is not conclusive, our data appear to be in qualitative agreement
with the expectation of a slow contraction followed by a rapid and highly

peak-intensity method. Using this rotation curve and an observed radial
distribution of intensity (emissivity), we construct a simulated PV diagram
(PV1). The difference between a rotation curve obtained from this PV1 and the
original RC (e.g., difference between peak-intensity velocities) is used to
correct the initial RC to obtain a corrected rotation curve, RC1. This RC1 is
used to calculated another PVD (PV2) using the observed intensity distribution,
and to obtain the second iterated RC (RC2). This iteration is repeated until
PV$i$ converges to PV0, so that the differences between PV$i$ and PV0 becomes
minimum. Finally RC$i$ is adopted as the most reliable rotation curve. We apply
this method to some observed PVDs of nearby galaxies, and show that the
iteration successfully converges to give reliable rotation curves. We show that
the method is powerful to detect central massive objects.

by Bernard J.F. Lonergan (BL) in the late 1940's was laid out in a manner now
recognizable as representing an early model of complexity. This report is a
first effort toward eventually translating that qualitative vision, designated
Emergent Probability, into a viable network computer program.
  In his study of human understanding, Lonergan saw the task of constructing a
cohesive body of explanatory knowledge as a convoluted building process of
schemes of recurrence that act as foundational elements to further growth.
Although BL's kernal recurrent scheme was composed of the cognitional dynamics
surrounding Insight, other examples abound in nature: resource cycles, motor
skills, biological routines, autocatalytic processes, etc. The corresponding
growing generic World Process can alternatively be thought of as chemical,
environmental, evolutionary, social, organizational, economical, psychological,
or ethical, and its generality might be of particular interest to complex

approximate formulas in polynomial form for partial derivatives in

al. [3] proposed the compact matrix form of these DQ approximate formulas. In
this study, by using these matrix approximate formulas, the DQ formulations for
the Poisson and convection-diffusion equations can be expressed as the Lyapunov
algebraic matrix equation. The formulation effort is simplified, and a simple
and explicit matrix formulation is obtained. A variety of fast algorithms in
the solution of the Lyapunov equation [4-6] can be successfully applied in the
DQ analysis of these two-dimensional problems, and, thus, the computing effort
can be greatly reduced. Finally, we also point out that the present reduction

BEM (DRBEM) and dynamic programming filter to inverse elastodynamic problem.
The DRBEM is the only BEM method, which does not require domain discretization
for general linear and nonlinear dynamic problems. Since the size of numerical
discretization system has a great effect on the computing effort of recursive
or iterative calculations of inverse analysis, the intrinsic boundary-only
merit of the DRBEM causes a considerable computational saving. On the other
hand, the strengths of the dynamic programming filter lie in its mathematical
simplicity, easy to program and great flexibility in the type, number and
locations of measurements and unknown inputs. The combination of these two
techniques is therefore very attractive for the solution of practical inverse
problems. In this study, the spatial and temporal partial derivatives of the
governing equation are respectively discretized first by the DRBEM and the
precise integration method, and then, by using dynamic programming with
regularization, dynamic load is estimated based on noisy measurements of
velocity and displacement at very few locations. Numerical experiments involved
with the periodic and Heaviside impact load are conducted to demonstrate the
applicability, efficiency and simplicity of this strategy. The affect of noise
level, regularization parameter, and measurement types on the estimation is
also investigated.

quite efficient numerical implementation, which is important, because the
functions encountered typically have a fractal character. The main results are
presented in several plots of these functions J(a,b) and D(a,b) and in an
over-all `chart' displaying, in the parameter plane, all possibly relevant
information on the system including, e.g., the dynamical phase diagram as well
as invariants such as the values of topological invariants (kneading numbers)
which, according to the formulas, determine the singularity structure of J and
D. Our most significant findings are: 1) `Nonlinear Response': The parameter
dependence of these transport properties is, throughout the `ergodic' part of
the parameter plane (i.e. outside the infinitely many Arnol'd tongues)
fractally nonlinear. 2) `Negative Response': Inside certain regions with an
apparently fractal boundary the current J and the bias b have opposite signs.

  University, Nagoya, Japan, December 2001",,,,"quant-ph gr-qc hep-th",,"  In modern quantum information theory one deals with an idealized situation
when the spacetime dependence of quantum phenomena is neglected. However the
transmission and processing of (quantum) information is a physical process in
spacetime. Therefore such basic notions in quantum information theory as qubit,
channel, composite systems and entangled states should be formulated in space
and time. In this paper some basic notions of quantum information theory are
considered from the point of view of quantum field theory and general
relativity. It is pointed out an important fact that in quantum field theory
there is a statistical dependence between two regions in spacetime even if they
are spacelike separated. A classical probabilistic representation for a family
of correlation functions in quantum field theory is obtained. A noncommutative
generalization of von Neumann`s spectral theorem is discussed. We suggest a new
physical principle describing a relation between the mathematical formalism of
Hilbert space and quantum physical phenomena which goes beyond the
superselection rules. Entangled states and the change of state associated with
the measurement process in space and time are discussed including the black
hole and the cosmological spacetime.
  It is shown that any reasonable state in relativistic quantum field theory
becomes disentangled at large spacelike distances if one makes local
observations. As a result a violation of Bell`s inequalities can be observed
without inconsistency with principles of relativistic quantum theory only if
the distance between detectors is rather small. We suggest a further
experimental study of entangled states in spacetime by studying the dependence
of the correlation functions on the distance between detectors.
