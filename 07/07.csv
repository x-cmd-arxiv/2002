uniform mean field (as is the case in our studies) is fundamentally different
from the one in which such a field is externally imposed. The ability of the
turbulence to bend and fold the magnetic-field lines leads to the emergence of
a distinctive small-scale structure. The fields are organized in folds of
characteristic length comparable to the size of the largest turbulent eddies
with spatial-direction reversals at the resistive scale. These folds are very
hard to destroy. In the nonlinear regime, the folding structure coexists with
Alfven waves propagating along the folds. The turbulent energy injected by the
forcing is dissipated in part resistively via the small-scale magnetic fields,
and in part viscously via the Alfven waves.

the thermodynamic limit and is found to be ${\cal R} = 1 + \cosh (h) /
\sqrt{\sinh^2 (h) + \exp (- 4 \beta)}$. This is positive definite and, for
physical fields and temperatures, diverges only at the zero-temperature,
zero-field ``critical point'' of the model.
  In this note we calculate ${\cal R}$ for the one-dimensional $q$-state Potts

enabling bounds to be placed on the decay constant, f_a, of a light saxion. The
low-energy coupling of the saxion, which couples at high energies to the QCD
gauge field strength, is expected to be enhanced from QCD scaling, making it
interesting to investigate if the saxion could place stronger bounds on f_a
than the axion itself. Moreover, since the properties of the saxion are
determined by f_a, a constraint on this parameter can be translated into a
constraint on the supersymmetry breaking scale. We find that the bound on f_a

part of the double gluon exchange amplitude play the relevant role. The
asymmetry in the inclusive set-up with the pion tagged in the fragmentation
region of the polarized proton does not depend on the center of mass energy in

transversal momentum of the pion. This ratio of the lowest order contribution
to the asymmetry may be interpreted as the partial contribution to the odderon

using riemannian foliation theory, we classify compact radiant Sim(n-1,1)
affine manifolds M such that D(M') the image of the universal cover M' of M by
the developing map D is contained in the upper cone defined q

the single valued extension property (SVEP) to satisfy Weyl's theorem and
$a$-Weyl's theorem. We show that if $T$ or $T^{\ast}$ has SVEP and $T$ is
transaloid, then Weyl's theorem holds for $f(T)$ for every $f\in H(\sigma
(T))$. When $T^{\ast}$ has SVEP, $T$ is transaloid and $T$ is $a$-isoloid, then
$a$-Weyl's theorem holds for $f(T)$ for every $f\in H(\sigma (T))$. We also
prove that if $T$ or $T^{\ast}$ has SVEP, then the spectral mapping theorem
holds for the Weyl spectrum and for the essential approximate point spectrum.

based on nonadiabatic geometric phase shifts, in which a cyclic geometric phase
is used to realize a set of universal quantum gates. Physical implementation of
this set of gates is designed for Josephson junctions and for NMR systems.
Interestingly, we find that the nonadiabatic phase shift may be independent of
the operation time under appropriate controllable conditions. A remarkable
feature of the present nonadiabatic geometric gates is that there is no
intrinsic limitation on the operation time, unlike adiabatic geometric gates.
Besides fundamental interest, our results may simplify the implementation of
geometric quantum computation based on solid state systems, where the
decoherence time may be very short.
