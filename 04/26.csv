increases rather than decreases the microlensing fluctuations caused by the
remaining stars. For a bright pair of images straddling a critical curve, the
saddlepoint (of the arrival time surface) is much more strongly affected than
the associated minimum. With a mass ratio of smooth matter to microlensing
matter of 4:1, a saddlepoint with a macro-magnification of mu = 9.5 will spend
half of its time more than a magnitude fainter than predicted. The anomalous
flux ratio observed for the close pair of images in MG0414+0534 is a factor of
five more likely than computed by Witt, Mao and Schechter if the smooth matter
fraction is as high as 93%. The magnification probability histograms for
macro-images exhibit distinctly different structure that varies with the smooth
matter content, providing a handle on the smooth matter fraction. Enhanced
fluctuations can manifest themselves either in the temporal variations of a
lightcurve or as flux ratio anomalies in a single epoch snapshot of a multiply
imaged system. While the millilensing simulations of Metcalf and Madau also
give larger anomalies for saddlepoints than for minima, the effect appears to
be less dramatic for extended subhalos than for point masses. Morever,
microlensing is distinguishable from millilensing because it will produce
noticeable changes in the magnification on a time scale of a decade or less.

our detailed study we are able to conclude that jet bow shock entrainment by an
episodic stellar wind, with a time-varying axis, produces most of the
high-velocity molecular outflow observed far from the source. In addition, near
PV Cephei we find evidence for a poorly collimated, wide-angle, molecular
outflow and a collimated wiggling jet-like molecular outflow. We propose that
the poorly collimated component is entrained by a wide-angle wind, and the
collimated component is entrained by a variable jet with internal working
surfaces. If this picture is true, then a stellar wind model which allows for
the coexistence of a wide-angle component and a collimated (jet-like) stellar
wind component is needed to explain the observed properties of the PV Ceph
outflow. The wiggling axis of the redshifted molecular outflow lobe indicates
that the outflow ejection axis is changing over time. We find that the
time-scale of the axis variation shown by the molecular outflow lobe is about a
factor of 10 less than that shown by the large-scale optical HH knots.

there is a clear decrease of specific frequency $S_N$ (number of clusters per

Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN). Following a radio flare in 2001
January, significant and variable circular polarisation, at a fractional level
of 0.2-0.4%, was measured with ATCA at four frequencies between 1-9 GHz.
Following an additional outburst 65 days later in 2001 March, further ATCA
observations measured a comparable sign and level of circular polarisation at
two frequencies. At this second epoch, contemporaneous MERLIN observations
directly imaged a relativistic ejection event and allowed us to confidently
associate both the circularly and linearly polarised emission with the
relativistic ejecta, allowing a detailed measurement of the full polarisation
properties in the optically thin phase. The fractional circular polarisation
spectrum appears to flatten at higher frequencies in 2001 January, when there
is strong evidence for multiple components at different optical depths. While
we cannot conclusively distinguish between synchrotron or propagation-induced
conversion as the origin of the circularly polarised component, we do not
consider that coherent or birefringent scintillation mechanisms are likely. The
implication is therefore that the ejections from GRS 1915+105 are associated
with a significant population of low-energy electrons, with associated
consequences for the energetics of relativistic ejection events. [abridged]

environment is discussed. The analysis considers both the thermal and temporal
evolution of the ICM which has passed through the bow shock of the radio source
and the effect of this swept-up gas on the dynamics of the radio source itself.
The final state of the swept-up ICM is critcally dependent on the thermal
conductivity of the gas. If the gas behind the bow shock expands adiabatically,
and the source is expanding into a steeply falling atmosphere, then a narrow
dense layer will form as the radio source lifts gas out of the cluster
potential. This layer has a cooling time very much less than that of the gas
just ahead of the radio source. This effect does not occur if the thermal
conductivity of the gas is high, or if the cluster atmosphere is shallow. The
swept-up gas also affects the dyamics of the radio source especially as it
slows towards sub-sonic expansion. The preferential accumulation of the
swept-up gas to the sides of the cocoon leads to the aspect ratio of the source
increasing. Eventually the contact surface must become Rayleigh-Taylor unstable
leading both to inflow of the swept-up ICM into the cavity created by the
cocoon, but also substantial mixing of the cooler denser swept-up gas with the
ambient ICM thereby creating a multi-phase ICM. The radio source is likely to
have a marked effect on the cluster on timescales long compared to the age of
the source.

wavelengths. The submillimetre camera SCUBA, mounted on the JCMT, is the first
large-scale submillimetre array, and as such is ideal for combatting the
effects of the atmosphere. For example, we find that the off-source pixels are
crucial for removing sky-noise. Benefitting from several years of SCUBA
operation, a database of deep SCUBA observations has been constructed to better
understand the nature of sky-noise and the effects of the atmosphere on
instrument sensitivity. This has revealed several results. Firstly, there is
evidence for positive correlations between sky-noise and seeing and sky-noise
and sky opacity. Furthermore, 850-micron and 450-micron sky-noise are clearly
correlated, suggesting that 450-micron data may be used to correct 850-micron
observations for sky-noise. Perhaps most important of all: if off-source
bolometers are used for sky-noise removal, there is no correlation between
instrument sensitivity and chop throw, for chop throws out to 180 arcsec.
Understanding the effects of submillimetre seeing is also important, and we
find that the JCMT beam is not significantly broadened by seeing, nor is there
an obvious correlation between seeing and pointing excursions.

ND3, through its 10a-00s transition near 310 GHz. Emission is found in the NGC
1333 region, both towards IRAS 4A and a position to the South-East where DCO+
peaks. In both cases, the hyperfine ratio indicates that the emission is
optically thin. Column densities of ND3 are 3--6 x 10^11 cm^-2 for T_ex=10 K
and twice as high for T_ex=5 K. Using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code and
a model of the structure of the IRAS source with temperature and density
gradients, the estimated ND3 abundance is 3.2 x 10^-12 if ND3/H2 is constant
throughout the envelope. In the more likely case that ND3/H2D+ is constant,
ND3/H2 peaks in the cold outer parts of the source at a value of 1.0 x 10^-11.
To reproduce the observed NH3/ND3 abundance ratio of ~1000, grain surface
chemistry requires an atomic D/H ratio of ~0.15 in the gas phase, >10 times
higher than in recent chemical models. More likely, the deuteration of NH3
occurs by ion-molecule reactions in the gas phase, in which case the data
indicate that deuteron transfer reactions are much faster than proton
transfers.

former case a basic limitation is noted, that the relative uncertainty in the

greater uncertainty stems from the crucial dependence of the Faraday-deduced
field on the coherence length scale characterizing its random orientation; we
further elaborate this dependence, and argue that previous estimates of the
field are likely to be too high by a factor of a few. Lack of detailed spatial
information on the radio emission--and the recently deduced nonthermal X-ray
emission in four clusters--has led to an underestimation of the mean value of
the field in cluster cores. We conclude therefore that it is premature to draw

satellites, as in the CDM cosmology, inevitably leads to an inner cusp of
density profile $\rho \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \gsim 1$, as seen in
cosmological N-body simulations. A flatter halo core with $\alpha <1$ exerts on
the satellites tidal compression in all directions, which prevents deposit of
stripped satellite material in the core region. This makes the satellite orbits
decay from the radius where $\alpha \sim 1$ to the halo centre with no local
tidal mass transfer and thus causes a rapid steepening of the inner profile to
$\alpha >1$. These tidal effects, the resultant steepening of the profile to a
cusp, and the stability of this cusp to tandem mergers with compact satellites,
are demonstrated using N-body simulations. The transition at $\alpha \sim 1$ is
then addressed using toy models in the limiting cases of impulse and adiabatic
approximations and using tidal radii for satellites on radial and circular
orbits. In an associated paper we address the subsequent slow convergence from
either side to an asymptotic stable cusp with $\alpha \gsim 1$. Our analysis
thus implies that an inner cusp is enforced when small haloes are typically
more compact than larger haloes, as in the CDM scenario, such that enough
satellite material makes it intact into the inner halo and is deposited there.
We conclude that a necessary condition for maintaining a flat core, as
indicated by observations, is that the inner regions of the CDM satellite
haloes be puffed up by about 50% such that when they merge into a bigger halo
they would be disrupted outside the halo core. This puffing up could be due to
baryonic feedback processes in small haloes, which may be stimulated by the
tidal compression in the halo cores.

Hamiltonian defined on a graph $\L={\cal A}\cup{\cal B}$ with ${\cal A}\cap

elements of ${\cal B}$. Since all the hopping matrix elements associated with
each bond are equal, the model is invariant under an arbitrary permutation of
the ${\cal A}$-sites and/or of the ${\cal B}$-sites. This is the Hubbard model
defined on the so called $(N_{A},N_{B})$-complete-bipartite graph, $N_{A}$
($N_{B}$) being the number of elements in ${\cal A}$ (${\cal B}$). In this
paper we analytically find the {\it exact} ground state for $N_{A}=N_{B}=N$ at
half filling for any $N$; the ground state expectation value of the repulsion
term has a maximum at a critical $N$-dependent value of the on-site Hubbard $U$
and then drops like 1/U for large $U$. The wave function and the energy of the
unique, singlet ground state assume a particularly elegant form for $N \ra
\inf$. We also calculate the spin-spin correlation function and show that the
ground state exhibits an antiferromagnetic order for any non-zero $U$ even in
the thermodynamic limit. This is the first explicit analytic example of an
antiferromagnetic ground state in a Hubbard-like model of itinerant electrons.
The kinetic term induces non-trivial correlations among the particles and an
antiparallel spin configuration in the two sublattices comes to be
energetically favoured at zero Temperature. On the other hand, if the
thermodynamic limit is taken and then zero Temperature is approached, a
paramagnetic behavior results. The thermodynamic limit does not commute with
the zero-Temperature limit, and this fact can be made explicit by the analytic
solutions.

about the role of high frequencies in black hole evaporation. Because of the
infinite gravitational redshift from the event horizon, Hawking quanta emerge
from configurations which possessed ultra high (trans-Planckian) frequencies.
Therefore Hawking radiation cannot be derived within the framework of a low
energy effective theory; and in all derivations there are some assumptions
concerning Planck scale physics. The analogy with condensed matter physics was
thus introduced to see if the asymptotic properties of the Hawking phonons
emitted by an acoustic black hole, namely stationarity and thermality, are
sensitive to the high frequency physics which stems from the granular character
of matter and which is governed by a non-linear dispersion relation. In 1995
Unruh showed that they are not sensitive in this respect, in spite of the fact
that phonon propagation near the (acoustic) horizon drastically differs from
that of photons. In 2000 the same analogy was used to establish the robustness
of the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations in inflationary models. This
analogy is currently stimulating research for experimenting Hawking radiation.
Finally it could also be a useful guide for going beyond the semi-classical
description of black hole evaporation.

neutron star X-ray binaries, but they have never been seen in any black hole

at finite temperature. We expect that, above a certain critical temperature,
also the U(1) axial symmetry will be restored. We will try to see if this
transition has (or has not) anything to do with the usual chiral transition:
various possible scenarios are discussed. In particular, we analyse a scenario
in which the U(1) axial symmetry is still broken above the chiral transitions.
We will show that this scenario can be consistently reproduced using an
effective Lagrangian model. A new order parameter is introduced for the U(1)

large circle of $S^5$. The energy of the classical solution $E$ is a function
of the spin $S$ and the momentum $J$ (R-charge) which interpolates between the

the 1-loop correction to the ground-state energy does not cancel for non-zero
$S$. For large $S$ it scales as $\ln S$, i.e. as the classical term, with no
higher powers of $\ln S$ appearing. This supports the conjecture made in
hep-th/0204051 that the classical $E-S = a \ln S$ scaling can be interpolated
to weak coupling to reproduce the corresponding operator anomalous dimension

calculate exactly the stability restrictions occuring for small measurement

of practical experimental relevance; to avoid a selection of the relative
impulse length by trial and error, it is advised to investigate whether the
used control scheme itself shows systematic limitations on the choice of the
impulse length. To investigate this point, a Floquet analysis is performed. For
OGY control the influence of the impulse length is marginal. As an unexpected
result, difference control fails when the impulse length is taken longer than a
maximal value that is approximately one half of the orbit length for small
Ljapunov numbers and decreases with the Ljapunov number.

The classical dynamics of two--dimensional area--preserving maps on the torus
is illustrated using the standard map and a perturbed cat map. The quantization
of area--preserving maps given by their generating function is discussed and
for the computation of the eigenvalues a computer program in Python is
presented. We illustrate the eigenvalue distribution for two types of perturbed
cat maps, one leading to COE and the other to CUE statistics. For the
eigenfunctions of quantum maps we study the distribution of the eigenvectors
and compare them with the corresponding random matrix distributions. The Husimi
representation allows for a direct comparison of the localization of the
eigenstates in phase space with the corresponding classical structures.
Examples for a perturbed cat map and the standard map with different parameters
are shown. Billiard systems and the corresponding quantum billiards are another
important class of systems (which are also relevant to applications, for
example in mesoscopic physics). We provide a detailed exposition of the
boundary integral method, which is one important method to determine the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz equation. We discuss several
methods to determine the eigenvalues from the Fredholm equation and illustrate
them for the stadium billiard. The occurrence of spurious solutions is
discussed in detail and illustrated for the circular billiard, the stadium
billiard, and the annular sector billiard. We emphasize the role of the normal
derivative function to compute the normalization of eigenfunctions, momentum
representations or autocorrelation functions in a very efficient and direct
way. Some examples for these quantities are given and discussed.

  Sciences Series",,,,"nlin.AO nlin.CG",,"  This paper reviews a class of generic dissipative dynamical systems called
N-K models. In these models, the dynamics of N elements, defined as Boolean
variables, develop step by step, clocked by a discrete time variable. Each of
the N Boolean elements at a given time is given a value which depends upon K
elements in the previous time step.
  We review the work of many authors on the behavior of the models, looking
particularly at the structure and lengths of their cycles, the sizes of their
basins of attraction, and the flow of information through the systems. In the
limit of infinite N, there is a phase transition between a chaotic and an
ordered phase, with a critical phase in between.
  We argue that the behavior of this system depends significantly on the
topology of the network connections. If the elements are placed upon a lattice
with dimension d, the system shows correlations related to the standard
percolation or directed percolation phase transition on such a lattice. On the
other hand, a very different behavior is seen in the Kauffman net in which all
spins are equally likely to be coupled to a given spin. In this situation,
coupling loops are mostly suppressed, and the behavior of the system is much
more like that of a mean field theory.
  We also describe possible applications of the models to, for example, genetic
networks, cell differentiation, evolution, democracy in social systems and
neural networks.

nonrelativistic chiral quark model. Partial conservation of the axial current
(PCAC) imposed at the quark operator level enforces an axial coupling for the
constituent quarks which is smaller than unity. This leads to an axial coupling
constant of the nucleon $g_A$ in good agreement with experiment. PCAC also
requires the inclusion of axial exchange currents. Their effects on the axial
form factors are analyzed. We find only small exchange current contributions to
$g_A$, which is dominated by the one-body axial current. On the other hand,
axial exchange currents give sizeable contributions to the axial radius of the
nucleon $r_A^2$, and to the non-pole part of the induced pseudoscalar form
factor $g_P$. For the latter, the confinement exchange current is the dominant
term.

of the problem requires a calculation of the enhancement coefficient K for the

calculation. The result is K = -4.9 +- 1.6. Limitations of the accuracy of the

consideration of the field equation of the energy conservation if one takes
into account Salam's effect. Such account results in the functional division
between gravitational, strong and electromagnetic interactions. The division
has the differential nature which is connected with an expansion of the
relativistic kinetic energy into McLoren's series. It is shown that the
existance of the angular momentum is connected with stationary features of the
series. The gauge transformations of the wave function and potential arise due
to the influence of the geometrization principle - variations of the
non-relativistic kinetic energy have to be equal to variations of the potential
energy on absolute value in the connected systems. The numerical quantities of
the elementary angular momentum, constant of the gravitational interaction and
the ratio of the rest masses of the proton and electron are coordinated with
corresponding experimental quantities.

associated diffusion equation are constructed on a space that is algebraically
described as the merging of the real line algebra with the anyonic line
algebra. Technically this merged structure is a smash algebra, namely an
algebra resulting by a braided tensoring of real with anyonic line algebras.
  The motivation of introducing the smashing results from the necessity of
having non commuting increments in the random walk. Based on the
observable-state duality provided by the underlying Hopf structure, the
construction is cast into two dual forms: one using functionals determined by
density probability functions and the other using the associated Markov
transition operator. The ensuing diffusion equation is shown to possess
triangular matrix realization.
  The study is completed by the incorporation of Hamiltonian dynamics in the
above random walk model, and by the construction of the dynamical equation
obeyed by statistical moments of the problem for generic entangled density
functions.
