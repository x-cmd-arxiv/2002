  Accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal, July 2002 issue",,"10.1086/340965",,"astro-ph",,"  The Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 camera has been used to image Andromeda III,
a dwarf spheroidal companion (dSph) to M31. The resulting color-magnitude (c-m)
diagrams reveal the morphology of the horizontal branch (HB) in this dwarf
galaxy. We find that like Andromeda I and Andromeda II, and like most of the
Galactic dSph companions, the HB morphology of And III is predominantly red,
redder than that of both And I and And II despite And III having a lower mean
metallicity. We interpret this red HB morphology as indicating that the bulk of
the And III population is ~3 Gyr younger than the age of the majority of
Galactic globular clusters. Nevertheless, the And III c-m diagram does reveal a
few blue HB stars, and a number of RR Lyrae variables are also evident in the
data. This indicates that And III does contain an `old' population of age
comparable to that of the Galactic globular clusters. There is no evidence,
however, for any young stars in And III despite a claimed association between
this dSph and an HI cloud. As was the case for And II, but not And I, no radial
gradient was detected in the And III HB morphology. And III is ~75 kpc from the
center of M31, comparable to the Galactocentric distances of Sculptor and
Draco. Comparison with standard globular cluster red giant branches indicates
<[Fe/H]> = -1.88 +/-0.11, consistent with the absolute-magnitude - mean
abundance relation followed by dSph galaxies. The same comparison yields an
intrinsic abundance dispersion of sigma([Fe/H]) = 0.12, a low value compared to
the Galactic dSphs of comparable luminosity to And III. The list of candidate
variables reveals one definite and one probable Anomalous Cepheid variables.

detected from four other sources near the program objects. The SiO detection
rate increases steeply with the period, particularly for stars with P>500 d,
where it exceeds 80%. We found at a given period that the SiO detection rate is
approximately double that for OH. These facts suggest that the large-amplitude
variables in the Nuclear Disk region are AGB stars similar in their overall
properties to the inner and outer bulge IRAS/SiO sources.

navigation cameras to map the inner zodiacal light at optical wavelengths over
elongations of 3-30 degrees from the Sun. This surface brightness map is then
used to infer the spatial distribution of interplanetary dust over heliocentric
distances of about 10 solar radii to the orbit of Venus. We also apply a simple
model that attributes the zodiacal light as being due to three dust populations
having distinct inclination distributions, namely, dust from asteroids and
Jupiter-family comets (JFCs), dust from Halley-type comets, and an isotropic
cloud of dust from Oort Cloud comets. The best-fitting scenario indicates that
asteroids + JFCs are the source of about 45% of the optical dust cross-section
seen in the ecliptic at 1 AU, but that at least 89% of the dust cross-section
enclosed by a 1 AU radius sphere is of a cometary origin. When these results
are extrapolated out to the asteroid belt, we find an upper limit on the mass
of the light-reflecting asteroidal dust that is equivalent to a 12 km asteroid,
and a similar extrapolation of the isotropic dust cloud out to Oort Cloud
distances yields a mass equivalent to a 30 km comet, although the latter mass
is uncertain by orders of magnitude.

frequency as inferred from burst oscillations. This strongly challenges the
sonic-point beat frequency model for the kHz QPOs found in low-mass X-ray
binaries. We detect two simultaneous kHz QPOs with a frequency separation of
323.3+-4.3 Hz in an average Fourier power spectrum of observations obtained in
September 2001 and January 2002. The lower kHz QPO frequency varied between 644
Hz and 769 Hz. In previous observations of this source the peak separation
frequency was ~250 Hz when the lower kHz QPO frequency was ~900 Hz. Burst
oscillations occur in 4U 1636-53 at ~581 Hz and possibly at half that frequency
(290.5 Hz). This is the first source where the peak separation frequency is
observed to change from less than (half) the burst oscillation frequency to
more than that. This observation contradicts all previously formulated
implementations of the sonic-point beat frequency model except those where the
