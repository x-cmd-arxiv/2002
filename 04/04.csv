photometry, space-based UV spectroscopy, and UV/optical spectrophotometry. The
advantages of our technique include numerous consistency checks and, in the
case of the distance determinations, the absence of zero point uncertainties

the squared temperature power spectrum as a probe of this trispectrum and, more
importantly, as an observational approach to extracting the power spectrum of
the deflection angle associated with the weak gravitational lensing effect on
the CMB. We extend previous discussions on the trispectrum and associated weak
lensing reconstruction from CMB data by calculating non-Gaussian noise
contributions, beyond the previously discussed dominant Gaussian noise.
Non-Gaussian noise contributions are generated by lensing itself and by the
correlation between the lensing effect and other foreground secondary
anisotropies in the CMB such as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. When the SZ
effect is removed from temperature maps using its spectral dependence, we find
these additional non-Gaussian noise contributions to be an order of magnitude
lower than the dominant Gaussian noise. If the noise-bias due to the dominant
Gaussian part of the temperature squared power spectrum is removed, then these
additional non-Gaussian contributions provide the limiting noise level for the
lensing reconstruction. The temperature squared power spectrum allows a high
signal-to-noise extraction of the lensing deflections and a confusion-free
separation of the curl (or B-mode) polarization due to inflationary
gravitational waves from that due to lensed gradient (or E-mode) polarization.
The small angular scale temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements
provide a novel approach to weak lensing studies, complementing the approach

  X-ray spectroscopy of AGN with Chandra and XMM-Newton (MPE, 2001)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  With the advent of Chandra and XMM, X-ray lines spectroscopy of AGN outflows
is off to an exciting start. In this paper we illuminate some of the
complications involved in extracting the outflow's physical conditions
(ionization equilibrium, total column density, chemical abundances) from such
spectroscopic data. To do so we use the example provided by high-quality FUSE
and HST observations of the outflow seen in NGC 985.
  We show how simple determinations of the column density in the UV absorption
lines often severely underestimate the real column densities. This is due to
strong non-black saturation of the absorption troughs, where in many cases the
UV line profile mainly reflects the velocity-dependent covering factor rather
than the column density distribution. We then show that underestimating
individual ionic column densities by a factor of 5 can cause a two orders of
magnitude error in the inferred total column density of the outflow. In some
case this will be enough to associate the UV and X-ray absorber with the same
outflowing material.
  Finally, we note that the UV spectra of NGC 985 have 10--20 times the
resolution and 2--5$\times$ the S/N per resolution element compared with the
best available Chandra spectra of similar objects. Therefore, in the X-ray band
non-black saturation and velocity-dependent covering factor effects will only
become abundantly clear using vastly more capable future X-ray telescopes.
However, by taking into consideration the lessons learned from the UV band, we
can greatly improve the quality of physical constraints we extract from current
X-ray data of AGN outflows.

Function"" [SCF] to intercompare simulations and observations of the atomic
interstellar medium. The simulations considered mimic three distinct sets of
physical conditions. One of them (run ""ISM"") is intended to represent a mixture
of cool and warm atomic gas, and includes self-gravity and magnetic fields. For
each simulation, H I spectral-line maps are synthesized and intercompared, both
with each other, and with observations, using the SCF. We find that, when
thermal broadening is large in comparison with fine-scale turbulent velocity
structure, it masks sub-thermal velocity sub-structure in the synthesized
spectra. The H I observations we use here for comparison are of the North
Celestial Pole (NCP) Loop. None of the simulations match the NCP Loop data very
well. The most realistic sets of line profiles and SCF statistics comes from
artifically rescaling the velocity axis of run ISM. Without rescaling, almost
all velocity structure is smeared out by thermal broadening. However, if the
velocity axis is expanded by a factor of 6, the SCF distributions of run ISM an
the NCP Loop match up fairly well. This means that the ratio of thermal to
turbulent pressure in run ISM is much too large as it stands, and that the
simulation is deficient in turbulent energy. This is a consequence of run ISM
not including the effects of supernovae. We conclude that the SCF is a useful
tool for understanding and fine-tuning simulations of interstellar gas, and in
particular that realistic simulations of the atomic ISM need to include the
effects of energetic stellar winds (e.g. supernovae) in order for the ratio of
thermal-to-turbulent pressure to give spectra representative of the observed
interstellar medium in our Galaxy.

technique finds that the molecular gas is closely associated with the

the radio continuum at 6cm cannot be due to dust heating and gas ionization in

suddenly suppressed. Gravitation alone cannot retain the newly-formed stars and
at birth places beyond a certain galactocentric radius they escape to

backbone of the orbital structure is not just the x1 family, as in 2D models,
but a tree of 2D and 3D families bifurcating from x1. Besides the main tree we
have also found another group of families of lesser importance around the
radial 3:1 resonance. The families of this group bifurcate from x1 and
influence the dynamics of the system only locally. We also find that 3D orbits
elongated along the bar minor axis can be formed by bifurcations of the planar
x2 family. They can support 3D bar-like structures along the minor axis of the
main bar. Banana-like orbits around the stable Lagrangian points build a forest
of 2D and 3D families as well. The importance of the 3D x1-tree families at the
outer parts of the bar depends critically on whether they are introduced in the
system as bifurcations in $z$ or in $\dot{z}$.

the bar and of the parameters of the central bulge of the galactic model. The
morphology of the stable orbits in the bar region is associated with the degree
of folding of the x1-characteristic. This folding is larger for lower values of
the pattern speed. The elongation of rectangular-like orbits belonging to x1
and to x1-originated families depends mainly on the pattern speed. The detailed
investigation of the trees of bifurcating families in the various models shows
that major building blocks of 3D bars can be supplied by families initially
introduced as unstable in the system, but becoming stable at another energy
interval. In some models without radial and vertical 2:1 resonances we find,
except for the x1 and x1-originated families, also families related to the
z-axis orbits, which support the bar. Bifurcations of the x2 family can build a

holes still remain to be filled, as the commonly adopted mathematical
formulation suffers from a variety of limitations, that make it unsuitable to
provide a general tool of analysis for real networks, and not just for
mathematical (topological) abstractions. In this paper we show where the major
problems arise, and how there is therefore the need for a new reformulation of
the small-world concept. Together with an analysis of the variables involved,
we then propose a new theory of small-world networks based on two leading
concepts: efficiency and cost. Efficiency measures how well information
propagates over the network, and cost measures how expensive it is to build a
network. The combination of these factors leads us to introduce the concept of
{\em economic small worlds}, that formalizes the idea of networks that are
""cheap"" to build, and nevertheless efficient in propagating information, both
at global and local scale. This new concept is shown to overcome all the
limitations proper of the so-far commonly adopted formulation, and to provide
an adequate tool to quantitatively analyze the behaviour of complex networks in
the real world. Various complex systems are analyzed, ranging from the realm of
neural networks, to social sciences, to communication and transportation
networks. In each case, economic small worlds are found. Moreover, using the
economic small-world framework, the construction principles of these networks
can be quantitatively analyzed and compared, giving good insights on how
efficiency and economy principles combine up to shape all these systems.

is impossible without including a specific correlation energy, which is defined
by the difference between the sum of the kinetic and exchange energies of a
system considered within KS and HF, respectively. It is the nonlocal exchange
potential entering the HF equations that generates this correlation energy. We
show that the total correlation energy of a finite electron system, which has
to include this correlation energy, cannot be obtained from considerations of
uniform electron systems. The single-particle excitation spectrum of
many-electron systems is related to the eigenvalues of the corresponding KS
equations. We demonstrate that this spectrum does not coincide in general with
the eigenvalues of KS or HF equations.

the time evolution of temperature and of the velocity distribution function of

according to the viscoelastic law. We show that for the studied systems the
simple scaling hypothesis for the velocity distribution function is violated,
i.e. that its evolution is not determined only by the time dependence of the
thermal velocity. We observe, that the deviation from the Maxwellian
distribution, which we quantify by the value of the second coefficient of the
Sonine polynomial expansion of the velocity distribution function, does not
depend on time monotonously. At first stage of the evolution it increases on
the mean-collision time-scale up to a maximum value and then decays to zero at
the second stage, on the time scale corresponding to the evolution of the
granular gas temperature. For granular gas in the homogeneous cooling regime we
also evaluate the time-dependent self-diffusion coefficient of granular

polarization-dependent doubling in photon propagation speeds) from that of
bi-metricity (where the two photon polarizations ``see'' two distinct metrics).
We emphasise that these notions are logically distinct, though there are
special symmetries in ordinary (3+1)-dimensional nonlinear electrodynamics
which imply the stronger condition of bi-metricity.
  To illustrate this phenomenon we investigate a generalized version of
(3+1)-dimensional nonlinear electrodynamics, which permits the inclusion of
arbitrary inhomogeneities and background fields. [For example dielectrics (a la
Gordon), conductors (a la Casimir), and gravitational fields (a la
Landau--Lifshitz).] It is easy to demonstrate that the generalized theory is
bi-refringent: In (3+1) dimensions the Fresnel equation, the relationship
between frequency and wavenumber, is always quartic. It is somewhat harder to
show that in some cases (eg, ordinary nonlinear electrodynamics) the quartic
factorizes into two quadratics thus providing a bi-metric theory. Sometimes the
quartic is a perfect square, implying a single unique effective metric. We
investigate the generality of this factorization process.

to handle more general situations like: (i) spacetimes which are not
asymptotically flat (like the de Sitter spacetime) and (ii) spacetimes with
multiple horizons having different temperatures (like the Schwarzschild-de
Sitter spacetime) and provide a consistent interpretation for temperature,
entropy and energy. I show that it is possible to write Einstein's equations
for a spherically symmetric spacetime in the form $TdS-dE=PdV$ near {\it any}
horizon of radius $a$ with $S=(1/4)(4\pi a^2), |E| = (a/2)$ and the temperature
$T$ determined from the surface gravity at the horizon. The pressure $P$ is
provided by the source of the Einstein's equations and $dV$ is the change in
the volume when the horizon is displaced infinitesimally. The same results can
be obtained by evaluating the quantum mechanical partition function {\it
without using Einstein's equations or WKB approximation for the action}. Both
the classical and quantum analysis provide a simple and consistent
interpretation of entropy and energy for de Sitter spacetime as well as for
$(1+2)$ dimensional gravity. For the Rindler spacetime the entropy per unit
transverse area turns out to be $(1/4)$ while the energy is zero. The approach
also shows that the de Sitter horizon -- like the Schwarzschild horizon -- is

is the Planck length. This reduction of the cosmological constant from
$L_P^{-2} $ to $L_P^{-2}(L_PH_0)^2$ may be interpreted as due to the ability of
quantum micro structure of spacetime to readjust itself and absorb bulk vacuum
energy densities. Being a quantum mechanical process, such a cancellation
cannot be exact and the residual quantum fluctuations appear as the ``small''
cosmological constant. I describe the features of a toy model for the spacetime
micro structure which could allow for the bulk vacuum energy densities to be
canceled leaving behind a small residual value of the the correct magnitude.
Some other models (like the ones based on canonical ensemble for the four
volume or quantum fluctuations of the horizon size) lead to an insignificantly
small value of $H_0^2(L_PH_0)^n$ with $n=0.5-1$ showing that obtaining the

with two 4D branes B1 and B2 separated in the extra dimension. Using an
off-shell 5D supergravity (SUGRA) formalism, we argue that the SUSY breaking
scales could be non-universal even at the fundamental scale in a brane world
setting, since SUSY breaking effects could be effectively localized. As an
application, we suggest a model in which the two light chiral MSSM generations
reside on B1, while the third generation is located on B2, and the Higgs
multiplets as well as gravity and gauge multiplets reside in the bulk. For SUSY
breaking of the order of 10--20 TeV caused by a hidden sector localized at B1,
the scalars belonging to the first two generations can become sufficiently
heavy to overcome the SUSY flavor problem. SUSY breaking on B2 from a different
localized hidden sector gives rise to the third generation soft scalar masses
of the order of 1 TeV. Gaugino masses are also of the order of 1 TeV if the
size of the extra dimension is $\sim 10^{-16}$ ${\rm GeV}^{-1}$. As in 4D
effective supersymmetric theory, an adjustment of TeV scale parameters is
needed to realize the 100 GeV electroweak symmetry breaking scale.

Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time path formalism. It is shown that the magnetic
screening mass is non-zero at the one loop level whenever the initial gluon
distribution function is non isotropic with the assumption that the
distribution function of the gluon is not divergent at zero transverse
momentum. For isotropic gluon distribution functions, such as those describing
local equilibrium, the magnetic mass at one loop level is zero which is
consistent with finite temperature field theory results. Assuming that a
reasonable initial gluon distribution function can be obtained from a
perturbative QCD calculation of minijets, we determine these out of equilibrium
values for the initial magnetic and Debye screening masses at energy densities
appropriate to RHIC and LHC. We also compare the magnetic masses obtained here
with those obtained using finite temperature lattice QCD methods at similar
temperatures at RHIC and LHC.

higher-twist nuclear parton matrix elements. The gluon bremsstrahlung induced
by multiple scattering depends not only on direct parton matrix elements but
also on momentum-crossed ones, due to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal
interference effect. We show that both types of twist-four nuclear parton
matrix elements can be factorized approximately into the product of twist-two
nucleon matrix elements in the limit of extremely large nuclei, $A\to \infty$,
as assumed in previous studies. Due to the correlative nature of the twist-four
matrix elements under consideration, it is actually the off-forward parton
distributions that appear naturally in this decomposition, rather than the
ordinary diagonal distributions probed in deeply-inelastic scattering. However,
we argue that the difference between these two distribution classes is small in
certain kinematic regimes. In these regions, the twist-four nuclear parton
matrix elements are evaluated numerically and compared to the factorized form
for different nuclear sizes within a schematic model of the two-nucleon
correlation function. The nuclear size dependence is found to be $A^{4/3}$ in
the limit of large $A$, as expected. We find that the factorization is
reasonably good when the momentum fraction carried by the gluon field is
moderate. The deviation can be more than a factor of 2, however, for small
gluon momentum fractions, where the gluon distribution is very large.

supersymmetry breaking arising from some hidden sector dynamics. The interplay
between the SS and the brane localized breaking is studied in detail.

principle' which asserts the existence of an additive and extensive entropy
function, S, that is defined for all equilibrium states of thermodynamic
systems and whose increase characterizes the possible state changes under
adiabatic conditions. It is one of the few really fundamental physical laws (in
the sense that no deviation, however tiny, is permitted) and its consequences
are far reaching. This principle is independent of models, statistical
mechanical or otherwise, and can be understood without recourse to Carnot
cycles, ideal gases and other assumptions about such things as `heat',
`temperature', `reversible processes', etc., as is usually done. Also the well
known formula of statistical mechanics, S = -\sum p log p, is not needed for
the derivation of the entropy principle.
  This contribution is partly a summary of our joint work (Physics Reports,

a consequence of certain basic properties of the relation of adiabatic
accessibility among equilibrium states. We also present some open problems and

457}, 1855-1872 (2001)) that, in the semiclassical limit, the scarring of
quantum eigenfunctions by classical periodic orbits in chaotic systems may be
dramatically enhanced when the orbits in question undergo bifurcation.
Specifically, a bifurcating orbit gives rise to a scar with an amplitude that
scales as $\hbar^{\alpha}$ and a width that scales as $\hbar^{\omega}$, where
$\alpha$ and $\omega$ are bifurcation-dependent scar exponents whose values are
typically smaller than those ($\alpha=\omega=1/2$) associated with isolated and
unstable periodic orbits. We here analyze the influence of bifurcations on the
autocorrelation function of quantum eigenstates, averaged with respect to
energy. It is shown that the length-scale of the correlations around a
bifurcating orbit scales semiclassically as $\hbar^{1-\alpha}$, where $\alpha$
is the corresponding scar amplitude exponent. This imprint of bifurcations on
quantum autocorrelations is illustrated by numerical computations for a family
of perturbed cat maps.

effective mass of photon is to calculate the self-energy of photon
perturbatively. It shows that the effective mass of photon is about $5.42MeV$
in the symmetric nuclear matter at the saturation density $\rho_0 =
0.16fm^{-3}$ and about $2.0MeV$ at the surface of ${}^{238}U$. It seems that
the two-body decay of a massive photon causes the sharp lines of
electron-positron pairs in the low energy heavy ion collision experiments of
${}^{238}U+{}^{232}Th$ .

systems or systems with long range interactions where multiple particle
interactions must be taken into consideration. Within Boltzmann's kinetic
formalism, we study the influence of other interacting particles in terms of a
random distortion of energy and momentum conservation occurring when
multi-particle interactions are considered as binary collisions. Energy and
momentum conservation still holds exactly but not in each model binary
collision. We show how this new system differs from the Boltzmann system and we
note that our approach naturally explains the emergence of Tsallis-like
equilibrium statistics in physically relevant systems in terms of the long
since neglected physics of interacting and dense systems.

the exchange of virtual electron--positron pairs. Effectively, this gives rise
to self-interaction terms in Maxwell's equations, similar to the nonlinearities
due to polarization in nonlinear optics. These self-interaction terms vanish in
the limit of parallel propagating waves. However if the modes generated in
bounded regions are used, there will be a non-zero total effect. We show that
stationary two-dimensional light bullets can form in guiding structures, due to
the balancing effect of quantum electrodynamical vacuum nonlinearities on
dispersion and diffraction. These light bullets are unstable and exhibit the
possibility of self-focusing collapse. The consequences of our results are also
discussed.

We show how these parameters can be determined reliably using computer

scaling method, which allows to trace the energy dependence of alpha_s and
quark masses over several orders of magnitude. We also discuss methods designed
to reduce the effects of finite lattice spacing and address the issue of
computer resources required.

We show that the position of such a light beam can be measured using a split
detector with an increased precision compared to a classical beam. This method
can be used to improve the sensitivity of small displacement measurements.
