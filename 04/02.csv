the time-delay transfer functions by simulating the distribution of

time-independent Hamiltonian systems that admit a coexistence of regular and
chaotic phase space regions, allowing also for low amplitude perturbations
idealised as periodic driving, friction, and/or white and colored noise. The
evolution of initially localised ensembles of orbits was probed through lower
order moments and coarse-grained distribution functions. In the absence of
time-dependent perturbations, regular ensembles disperse initially as a power
law in time and only exhibit a coarse-grained approach towards an invariant
equilibrium over comparatively long times. Chaotic ensembles generally diverge
exponentially fast on a time scale related to a typical finite time Lyapunov
exponent, but can exhibit complex behaviour if they are impacted by the effects
of cantori or the Arnold web. Viewed over somewhat longer times, chaotic
ensembles typical converge exponentially towards an invariant or near-invariant
equilibrium. This, however, need not correspond to a true equilibrium, which
may only be approached over very long time scales. Time-dependent perturbations
can dramatically increase the efficiency of phase mixing, both by accelerating
the approach towards a near-equilibrium and by facilitating diffusion through
cantori or along the Arnold web so as to accelerate the approach towards a true
equilibrium. The efficacy of such perturbations typically scales
logarithmically in amplitude, but is comparatively insensitive to most other
details, a conclusion which reinforces the interpretation that the
perturbations act via a resonant coupling.

the central cusp in the density profiles of dark halos is the consequence of
self-limiting merging of small, dense halos. This implies that the collapse of
a system of clumps/substructure is not sufficient to form a cD galaxy, with an
extended envelope; plausibly subsequent accretion of large galaxies is

is incompatible with early analytical estimates. In simulations with millions
of particles reaching a resolution of 20-40 pc, the pattern speed may not
change over billions of years. Our high resolution models produce bars which
are fast rotators, where the ratio of the corotation radius to the bar major
semi-axis lies in the range R =1.2-1.7, marginally compatible with
observational results. In contrast to many previous simulations, we find that
bars are relatively short. As in many observed cases, the bar major semi-axis
is close to the exponential length of the disk. The transfer of angular
momentum between inner and outer parts of the disk plays a very important role
in the secular evolution of the disk and the bar. The bar formation increases
the exponential length of the disk by a factor of 1.2 -1.5. The transfer
substantially increases the stellar mass in the centre of the galaxy and
decreases the dark matter-to-baryons ratio. As the result, the central 2 kpc
region is always strongly dominated by the baryonic component. At intermediate
3-10kpc scales the disk is sub-dominant. In summary, realistic models produce
bar structure in striking agreement with observational results.

oscillations driven by a coupling between the luminosity-dependent mass-loss
rate and the H fuel abundance in a nuclear-burning shell. When mass loss is
included, the outward flow of matter can modulate the flow of fuel into the
shell when the stellar luminosity is close to the Eddington luminosity $L_{\rm
Edd}$. When the luminosity drops below $L_{\rm Edd}$, the mass outflow declines
and the shell is re-supplied with fuel. This process can be repetitive. We
demonstrate the existence of such oscillations and discuss the dependence of
the results on the stellar parameters. In particular, we show that the
oscillation period scales specifically with the mass of the H-burning
relaxation shell (HBRS), defined as the part of the H-burning shell above the
minimum radius at which the luminosity from below first exceeds the Eddington
threshold at the onset of the mass loss phase. For a stellar mass $M_*\sim
0.7\Msun$, luminosity $L_*\sim 10^4\Lsun$, and mass loss rate $|\dot M|\sim
10^{-5}\Msun$ yr$^{-1}$, the oscillations have a recurrence time $\sim 1400$
years $\sim 57\tau_{\rm fsm}$, where $\tau_{\rm fsm}$ is the timescale for
modulation of the fuel supply in the HBRS by the varying mass-loss rate. This
period agrees with the $\sim$ 1400-year period inferred for the spacings
between the shells surrounding some planetary nebulae, and the the predictied
shell thickness, of order 0.4 times the spacing, also agrees reasonably well.

its application to Fomalhaut's collisionally replenished dust disk; a recent
450 micron image of this disk shows a clump embedded within it with a flux ~5
per cent of the total. The following conclusions are drawn: (i) SED modelling
is consistent with Fomalhaut's disk having a collisional cascade size
distribution extending from bodies 0.2 m in diameter down to 7 micron-sized
dust. (ii) Collisional lifetime arguments imply that the cascade starts with
planetesimals 1.5-4 km in diameter. Any larger bodies must be predominantly
primordial. (iii) Constraints on the timescale for the ignition of the cascade
are consistent with these primordial planetesimals having a distribution that
extends up to 1000km, resulting in a disk mass of 5-10 times the minimum mass
solar nebula. (iv) The debris disk is expected to be intrinsically clumpy,
since planetesimal collisions result in dust clumps. The intrinsic clumpiness
of Fomalhaut's disk is below current detection limits, but could be detectable
by future observatories such as the ALMA, and could provide the only way of
determining the primordial planetesimal population. (v) The observed clump
could have originated in a collision between two runaway planetesimals, both
larger than 1400 km diameter. It is unlikely that we should witness such an
event unless both the formation of these runaways and the ignition of the
collisional cascade occurred within the last ~10 Myr. (vi) Another explanation
for Fomalhaut's clump is that ~5 per cent of the planetesimals in the ring are

systemic velocity of the galaxy (about 1120 km/s). Symmetrically bracketing the
systemic velocity, the H2O emission covers a velocity range of 450 km/s with
only one potential narrow gap (20 km/s) near the systemic velocity itself.
Velocity drifts of individual components are not convincingly detected. It is
shown that the presence of red-shifted emission and the absence of detectable
velocity drifts are not inconsistent with the existence of a rotating
circumnuclear maser disk at the very center of the galaxy. Significant
differences in the overall line profile compared to NGC 4258 and a complex
morphology of the radio continuum leave, however, space for scepticism.

that this equivalence is valid only at a quasi--classical level -- both quantum
and thermal corrections to the magnetic properties of DE model differ from any
effective Heisenberg model because its spin excitations interact only
indirectly, through the exchange of charge fluctuations. To demonstrate this,
we perform a novel large S expansion for the coupled spin and charge degrees of
freedom of the DE model, aimed at projecting out all electrons not locally
aligned with core spins. We generalized the Holstein--Primakoff transformation
to the case when the length of the spin is by itself an operator, and
explicitly constructed new fermionic and bosonic operators to fourth order in
1/\sqrt{S}. This procedure removes all spin variables from the Hund coupling
term, and yields an effective Hamiltonian with an overall scale of electron
hopping, for which we evaluate corrections to the magnetic and electronic
properties in 1/S expansion to order O(1/S^2). We also consider the effect of a
direct superexchange antiferromagnetic interaction between core spins. We find
that the competition between ferromagnetic double exchange and an
antiferromagnetic superexchange provides a new example of an ""order from
disorder"" phenomenon -- when the two interactions are of comparable strength,
an intermediate spin configuration (either a canted or a spiral state) is
selected by quantum and/or thermal fluctuations.

as a quotient space and Superspace is presented as a direct generalization of
this. The focus is then shifted from a general presentation to the relation
between supersymmetry and complex geometry as manifested in the possible target
space geometries for N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models in four

$(M,\omega,I)$ using a modification of the Fedosov method based on a different
fibrewise product similar to the Wick product on $\mathbb C^n$. In a first step
we show that this construction is rich enough to obtain star products of every
equivalence class by computing Deligne's characteristic class of these
products. Among these products we uniquely characterize the ones which have the
additional property to be of Wick type which means that the bidifferential
operators describing the star products only differentiate with respect to
holomorphic directions in the first argument and anti-holomorphic directions in
the second argument. These star products are in fact strongly related to star
products with separation of variables introduced and studied by Karabegov. This
characterization gives rise to special conditions on the data that enter the
Fedosov procedure. Moreover, we compare our results that are based on an
obviously coordinate independent construction to those of Karabegov that were
obtained by local considerations and give an independent proof of the fact that
star products of Wick type are in bijection to formal series of closed
two-forms of type $(1,1)$ on $M$. Using this result we finally succeed in

as to allow finite time duration of the unrestricted coherent mean field
propagation which is followed by the decoherence into wave packets. In this new
model, the wave packet shrinking by the mean field propagation is respected as
well as the diffusion, so that it predicts a one-body dynamics similar to that
in mean field models. The shrinking effect is expected to change the diffusion
property of nucleons in nuclear matter and the global one-body dynamics. The
central $\xenon+\tin$ collisions at 50 MeV/nucleon are calculated by the models
with and without shrinking, and it is shown that the inclusion of the wave

expanding system with a moderate expansion velocity.

calculate the entropy loss associated with dimerization, and from it the free
energy difference between monomer and dimer, as well as the corresponding
equilibrium reaction constant. We find that the entropy loss of dimerization is
a strong function of energy (or temperature), and that it is much larger than
previously estimated, especially for high energy states. The results confirm
that it is possible to study the dimerization equilibrium of GCN4 at
physiological concentrations within the reduced representation of the protein
employed.
