spectral and temporal behaviour of their radio afterglows (AGs). A single
simple expression describes the AGs at all times and frequencies; its
high-frequency limit reproduces the successful CB model predictions for optical
and X-ray AGs. We analyze all of the observed radio AGs of GRBs with known
redshifts, including those of the exceptionally close-by GRB 980425. We also
study in detail the time-evolution of the AGs' spectral index. The agreement
between theory and observations is excellent, even though the CB model is
extremely frugal in the number of parameters required to explain the radio
observations. We propose to use the scintillations in the radio AGs of GRBs to
verify and measure the hyperluminal speed of their jetted CBs, whose apparent
angular velocity is of the same order of magnitude as that of galactic pulsars,
consistently measured directly, or via scintillations.

Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) data were used to search for structure in the
ultraviolet interstellar extinction curve. Between 1250 and 3200 A, in addition
to the well-known 2175 A bump, there is only one fairly small (10%) absorption
feature at 2700 A. The feature is very broad (>400 A). It coincides extremely
well in position and shape with laboratory measurements of presolar diamond
grains found in meteorites. As this feature appears in both the new STIS and
archival IUE data, it is unlikely to be an instrumental effect. This feature
appears to be ubiquitous in the ISM as it is seen along sightlines toward
various clouds with reddenings in the range of E(B-V) = 0.35 to 1.73 mag. The
identification with diamonds remains tentative since it is based on a single,
weak feature. If the feature is due to interstellar diamonds then they require
an order of magnitude more absorption strength per gram/cm^2 than the presolar
meteoritic diamonds measured in the lab.

addition of multivaltent salt to the solutions, a phase transition from
extended conformations to collapsed or bundled ones. Upon further addition of
salt they experience a second transition, a redissolution back into extended
conformations. This paper presents a theoretical study of the structure and
properties of the phase diagram of these solutions. On the basis of simple
phenomenological observations a schematic phase diagram is constructed that
allows a simple and explicit determination of the direction of the tie lines
within the coexistence region. The actual shape of the coexistence boundary is
determined by means of a model mean free energy functional that explicitly
includes the possibility of association of both counterions and coions to the
electrolyte. It is found that it is possible to redissolve the electrolytes
into conformations where the bare charge of the electrolyte is overcompensated
by the counterions but, due to the associated coions, can have either sign of
total effective charge. When coion association is possible, the redissolution
approximately coincides with the reassociation of the coions and counterions in
the bulk of the solution.

natural framework for studying isovector pairing correlations in nuclei. While
these correlations manifest themselves most clearly in the binding energies of
0^+ ground states, they also have a large effect on the energies of excited
states, including especially excited 0^+ states. In this article we consider
non-deformed as well as deformed algebraic descriptions of pairing through the
reductions of sp_{(q)}(4) to different realizations of u_{(q)}(2) for single-j
and multi-j orbitals. The model yields a classification scheme for completely
paired 0^{+} states of even-even and odd-odd nuclei in the 1d_{3/2}, 1f_{7/2},
and 1f_{5/2}2p_{1/2}2p_{3/2}1g_{9/2} shells. Phenomenological non-deformed and
deformed isospin-breaking Hamiltonians are expressed in terms of the generators
of the dynamical symmetry groups Sp(4) and Sp_{q}(4). These Hamiltonians are
related to the most general microscopic pairing problem, including isovector
pairing and isoscalar proton-neutron interaction along with non-linear
interaction in the deformed extension. In both the non-deformed and deformed
cases the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are fit to the relevant Coulomb
corrected experimental 0^{+} energies and this, in turn, allows us to estimate
the interaction strength parameters, to investigate isovector-pairing
properties and symmetries breaking, and to predict the corresponding energies.
While the non-deformed theory yields results that are comparable to other
theories for light nuclei, the deformed extension, which takes into account
higher-order interactions between the particles, gives a better fit to the
data. The multi-shell applications of the model provide for reasonable
predictions of energies of exotic nuclei.

"quant-ph/0204160","Jerzy Stryla","Jerzy Stryla","Integral equation of quantum stochastic process","12 pages, submitted to J. Math. Phys",,,,"quant-ph",,"  To describe stochastic quantum processes I propose an integral equation of
Volterra type which is not generally transformable to any differential one. The
process is a composition of ordinary quantum evolution which admits presence of
a quantum bath and reductions to pure states. It is proved that generically
solutions stabilize asymptotically for $t\to +\infty$ to a universal limit -
the projection onto the state with maximal available entropy. A number of
typical methods of finding solutions of the equation are proposed.

"quant-ph/0204161","Jerzy Stryla","Jerzy Stryla","Stochastic quantum process","7 pages, submitted to Chin. J. Phys. (Taipei)",,,,"quant-ph gr-qc",,"  I propose to treat quantum evolution as a stochastic process consisting from
a sequence of doubly stochastic matrices, which naturally arise in the
generalized quantum evolution. Then it is proved that the law of non-decreasing
entropy is fulfilled and that the law characterizes doubly stochastic matrices.
Finally, an application of the model to support the generalized second law of
black hole thermodynamics and a relation to the quantum histories formulation
of quantum physics appear.

proposed an alternative definition of quantum entropy based on Wigner
phase-space distribution functions and discussed its properties. They proposed
also some simple rules to construct positive-definite Wigner functions which
are crucial in their discussion. We show, however, that the main results
obtained and their discussion are incorrect.
