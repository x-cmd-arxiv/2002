  This paper presents a new class of models, which is produced by modifying
point fields commonly used in cosmology to mimic the galaxy distribution, but
where $\gamma=2$ is too large. The points are independently and randomly

  The Astronomical Journal",,"10.1086/341171",,"astro-ph",,"  The Hyades constitute a homogeneous sample of stars ideal for investigating
the dependence of planet formation on the mass of the central star. Due to
their youth, Hyades members are much more chromospherically active than stars
traditionally surveyed for planets using high precision radial velocity (RV)
techniques. Therefore, we have conducted a detailed investigation of whether
magnetic activity of our Hyades target stars will interfere with our ability to
make precise RV searches for substellar companions. We measure chromospheric
activity (which we take as a proxy for magnetic activity) by computing the
equivalent of the R'HK activity index from the Ca II K line. <R'HK> is not
constant in the Hyades: we confirm that it decreases with increasing
temperature in the F stars, and also find it decreases for stars cooler than
mid-K. We examine correlations between simultaneously measured R'HK and RV
using both a classical statistical test and a Bayesian odds ratio test. We find
that there is a significant correlation between R'HK and the RV in only 5 of
the 82 stars in this sample. Thus, simple Rprime HK-RV correlations will
generally not be effective in correcting the measured RV values for the effects
of magnetic activity in the Hyades. We argue that this implies long timescale
activity variations (of order a few years; i.e., magnetic cycles or growth and
decay of plage regions) will not significantly hinder our search for planets in
the Hyades if the stars are closely monitored for chromospheric activity. The
trends in the RV scatter (sigma'_v) with <R'HK>, vsini, and P_rot for our stars
is generally consistent with those found in field stars in the Lick planet
search data, with the notable exception of a shallower dependence of sigma'_v
on <R'HK> for F stars.

example The CN index (1.096 - 1.104 um) decreases with temperature, but the
strength of a blended feature at 1.28 um (consisting of primarily P beta)
increases. The slope of a star's spectrum can also be used to estimate its

rotation. A measurement of the planet's projected oblateness would constrain
the planet's rotational period. Planets that are synchronously rotating with
their orbital revolution will be rotating too slowly to be significantly
oblate; these include planets with orbital semi-major axes <~ 0.2AU (for M_P ~
M_J and M_* ~ M_sun). Jupiter-like planets in the range of orbital semi-major
axes 0.1 AU to 0.2 AU will tidally evolve to synchronous rotation on a
timescale similar to main sequence stars' lifetimes. In this case an oblateness
detection will help constrain the planet's tidal Q value.
  The projected oblateness of a transiting extrasolar giant planet is
measurable from a very high-photometric-precision transit light curve. For a
sun-sized star and a Jupiter-sized planet the normalized flux difference in the
transit ingress/egress light curve between a spherical and an oblate planet is
a few to 15 x 10^{-5} for oblateness similar to Jupiter and Saturn
respectively. The transit ingress and egress are asymmetric for an oblate
planet with an orbital inclination different from 90 degrees and a non-zero
projected obliquity. A photometric precision of 10^{-4} has been reached by HST
observations of the known transiting extrasolar planet HD209458b. In addition
several planned space missions (including MOST, MONS, Corot, and Kepler) will
study or find transiting giant planets with photometric precision <~ 10^{-5}.
In particular Kepler is expected to find ~40 transiting giant planets < 1 AU

by electron-hole symmetry in the C60 triply degenerate conduction band. In both
systems, it is known that NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T1) measurements
detect a gap in the electronic structure, most likely related to
singlet-triplet excitations of the Jahn-Teller distorted (JTD) C60^{2-} or
C60^{4-}. However, the extended temperature range of the measurements presented
here (10 K to 700 K) allows to reveal deviations with respect to this general
trend, both at high and low temperatures. Above room temperature, 1/T1 deviates
from the activated law that one would expect from the presence of the gap and
saturates. In the same temperature range, a lowering of symmetry is detected in
Na2C60 by the appearance of quadrupole effects on the 23Na spectra. In K4C60,
modifications of the 13C spectra lineshapes also indicate a structural
modification. We discuss this high temperature deviation in terms of a coupling
between JTD and local symmetry. At low temperatures, 1/T$_1$T tends to a
constant value for Na2C60, both for 13C and 23Na NMR. This indicates a residual
metallic character, which emphasizes the proximity of metallic and insulting
behaviors in alkali fullerides.

cubic fullerides known so far besides A3C60. 133Cs NMR signals the presence of
about 12 to 15% of ``anomalous'' C60 balls, characterized by a 15 meV gap. We
present different experimental observations supporting the idea that a
spin-singlet (i.e. a C60^{2-}) is localized on these latter balls and
stabilized by a JTD. A splitting of the 133Cs spectrum into three different
lines, with distinct electronic environments, is observed which emerges
naturally from such a situation. Quadrupole effects on 133Cs confirm an
inhomogeneous distribution of the charge between C60 molecules. Analysis of the
relative intensities of the 133Cs lines show that the spin-singlets do not form
clusters at the local scale, but are diluted within the lattice. This is
probably to avoid the occurrence of neighboring C60^{2-} and minimize
electrostatic repulsion between these balls. Through spin-lattice relaxation
measurements, we detect chemical exchange between the Cs sites above 100 K.
  From this, we deduce that the lifetime of a spin-singlet on a given ball
decreases exponentially with increasing temperature (from 15 sec at 100 K to 3
ms at 130 K). The implications of the presence of such spin-singlets for the
nature of the metallic state is discussed, in relation with a decrease of 1/T1T
for 13C at low temperatures, which would be anomalous for a simple metal.

allow to define unambiguously an increase of 1/T1T with increasing temperature,
which is anomalous in a simple metallic picture, where the Korringa law
predicts 1/T1T = cst. We attribute this increase to the existence of an
additional relaxation channel related to singlet-triplet (ST) excitations of
Jahn-Teller distorted C60^{2-} and C60^{4-}. These units are formed within the
metal on very short time scales (10^{-14} sec) that do not imply static charge
segregation. We show that the amplitude of the ST component depends directly on
the density of states, which indicates an interplay between metallic and
molecular excitations. Such an interaction is also revealed by the high
temperature behavior of Na2CsC60 and CsC60, that we then discuss. A divergence
between the behaviors of 1/T1, the NMR shift and the ESR susceptibility is
interpreted as the result of a rapid increase of the lifetime of the charge
carriers, signaling a tendency to charge localization. In our analysis, the
particular stability of C60^{2n-} is then a common feature of all known
metallic fullerides and allow to reconcile apparently contradicting properties
of these systems.

  1) Logarithmic Divergence: Regard the limit where the critical exponent \beta

  2) Universality: Define typical ranges for the free parameters, by observing
the best fit for historic crashes.

  Checking 88 years of Dow-Jones-Data for best fits, we find that 25% of those
that satisfy our inequality, occur less than one year before a crash. We
compare this with other methods of crash prediction, i.p. the universality
method of Johansen et al., which are followed by a crash in only 9% of the
cases.
  Combining the two approaches we obtain a method whose predictions are
followed by crashes in 54% of the cases.

of the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM), where CP violation induced by
complex $M_1$ and $\mu$ parameters is allowed. The formalism is based on the
construction of neutralino projectors, and can be directly generalized to
non-minimal SUSY models involving any number of neutralinos. It extends a
previous work applied to the real SUSY parameter case. In MSSM, the method
allows to describe all physical observables related to a specific neutralino,
in terms of its
  CP eigenphase and three complex numbers called its ""reduced projector
elements"".
  As the experimental knowledge on the neutralino-chargino sectors will be
being accumulated, the problem of extracting the various SUSY parameters will
arise. Motivated by this, we consider various scenarios concerning the
quantities that could be first measured. Analytical disentangled expressions
determining the related SUSY parameters from them, are then derived, which also
emphasize the efficiency of the formalism.

over special Lagrangian submanifolds and (2) deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills
bundles over complex submanifolds in Calabi-Yau manifolds.
  These moduli spaces reflect the geometry of the Calabi-Yau itself like a
mirror. Strominger, Yau and Zaslow conjecture that the mirror Calabi-Yau
manifold is such a moduli space and they argue that the mirror symmetry duality
is a Fourier-Mukai transformation. We review various aspects of the mirror
symmetry conjecture and discuss a geometric approach in proving it.
  The existence of rigid Calabi-Yau manifolds poses a serious challenge to the
conjecture. The proposed mirror partners for them are higher dimensional
generalized Calabi-Yau manifolds. For example, the mirror partner for a certain
K3 surface is a cubic fourfold and its Fano variety of lines is birational to
the Hilbert scheme of two points on the K3. This hyperkahler manifold can be
interpreted as the SYZ mirror of the K3 by considering singular special
Lagrangian tori.
  We also compare the geometries between a CY and its associated generalized
CY. In particular we present a new construction of Lagrangian submanifolds.
