flows outwards from the core. For an accreting neutron star in an X-ray
transient, the thermal quiescent flux depends sensitively on the amount of
hydrogen and helium remaining on the surface after an accretion outburst and on
the composition of the underlying ashes of previous H/He burning. Because H/He
has a higher thermal conductivity, a larger mass of H/He implies a shallower
thermal gradient through the low density envelope and hence a higher effective
temperature for a given core temperature. The mass of residual H and He varies
from outburst to outburst, so the thermal quiescent flux is variable even
though the core temperature is constant for timescales < 10 000 yr. Heavy
elements settle from a H/He envelope in a few hours; we therefore model the
quiescent envelope as two distinct layers, H/He over heavier elements, and
treat the mass of H/He as a free parameter. We find that the emergent thermal
quiescent flux can vary by a factor of 2 to 3 between different quiescent
epochs. The variation is more pronounced at lower interior temperatures, making
systems with low quiescent luminosities and frequent outbursts, such as SAX
J1808.4-3658, ideal candidates from which to observe this effect. We compute,
for different ash compositions, the interior temperatures of Cen X-4, Aql X-1,
and SAX J1808.4-3658. In the case of Aql X-1, the inferred high interior
temperature suggests that neutrino cooling contributes to the neutron star's
thermal balance.

Modeling the density distribution in individual haloes with the NFW profile, we
find, for all main progenitors of a given halo, there is a tight correlation
between its inner scale radius $r_s$ and the mass within it, $M_s$, which is
the basic reason why halo structural properties are closely related to their
mass-accretion histories. This correlation can be used to predict accurately
the structural properties of a dark halo at any time from its mass-accretion
history. We also test our model with a large sample of GIF haloes. The build-up
of dark haloes in CDM models generally consists of an early phase of fast
accretion and a late phase of slow accretion [where $M_h$ increases with time
approximately as the expansion rate]. These two phases are separated at a time
when the halo concentration parameter $c\sim 4$. Haloes in the two accretion
phases show systematically different properties, for example, the circular
velocity $v_h$ increases rapidly with time in the fast accretion phase but
remain almost constant in the slow accretion phase,the inner properties of a
halo, such as $r_s$ and $M_s$ increase rapidly with time in the fast accretion
phase but change only slowly in the slow accretion phase. The potential well
associated with a halo is built up mainly in the fast accretion phase, even
though a large amount of mass (over 10 times) can be accreted in the slow
accretion phase. We discuss our results in connection to the formation of dark
haloes and galaxies in hierarchical models.

In this state the polymer chain forms a system of densely packed folds,
mutually separated in all scales. The proof is based on the numerical and
analytical investigation of topological correlations in randomly generated
dense knots on strips $L_{v} \times L_{h}$ of widths $L_{v}=3,5$. We have
analyzed the conditional probability of the fact that a part of an unknotted
chain is also almost unknotted. The complexity of dense knots and quasi--knots
is characterized by the power $n$ of the Jones--Kauffman polynomial invariant.
It is shown, that for long strips $L_{h} \gg L_{v}$ the knot complexity $n$ is
proportional to the length of the strip $L_{h}$. At the same time, the typical
complexity of the quasi--knot which is a part of trivial knot behaves as $n\sim
\sqrt{L_{h}}$ and hence is significantly smaller. Obtained results show that
topological state of any part of the trivial knot in a collapsed phase is

site on the low-energy spectrum of the ferromagnetic Heisenberg XXZ chain. Such
fields, caused by impurities, can modify the low-energy spectrum significantly
by pinning certain excitations, such as kink and droplet states. We distinguish
between different boundary conditions (or sectors), the direction and also the
strength of the magnetic field. E.g., with a magnetic field in the z-direction
applied at the origin and ++ boundary conditions, there is a critical field
strength B_c (which depends on the anisotropy of the Hamiltonian and the spin
value) with the following properties: for B < B_c there is a unique ground
state with a gap, at the critical value, B_c, there are infinitely many
(droplet) ground states with gapless excitations, and for B>B_c there is again
a unique ground state but now belonging to the continuous spectrum. In
contrast, any magnetic field with a non-vanishing component in the xy-plane
yields a unique ground state, which, depending on the boundary conditions, is
either an (anti)kink, or an (anti)droplet state. For such fields, i.e., not
aligned with the z-axis, excitations always have a gap and we obtain a rigorous
lower bound for that gap.

laws contains two mutually exclusive values: attachment space attaching to
object and detachment space detaching from object. However, the cosmic physical
system could not start with mutually exclusive attachment space and detachment
space at the same time in the beginning. The way out of this impasse is that
the complete cosmic system consists of both the cosmic physical system and the
unphysical cosmic digital code. The unphysical cosmic digital code allows the
coexistence of attachment space and detachment space at the same time. The
cosmic digital code behaves as gene in organism, and the cosmic physical system
behaves as organ. Under different conditions and times, different spaces in the
cosmic digital code are activated to generate different spaces in the cosmic
physical systems with different physical laws for different universes in the
multivese. All universes start from the primitive multiverse, which only has
attachment space attaching to 10D string without the four force fields. During
the big bang in our universe, detachment space emerged to detach particle from
its four force fields. Such detachment, however, cannot be completely and
permanently detached, because particle still attaches to its force fields. The
result is hybrid space, combining both attachment space and detachment space in
coherent state, such as particle and its force fields. Hybrid space is the
space for wavefunction whose probability density is proportional to attachment
space, and inversely proportional to detachment space. The collapse of
wavefunction in decoherent state is the separation of attachment space and
detachment space in such way that attachment space attaches to particle, and
detachment space separately detaches from all probability density.
