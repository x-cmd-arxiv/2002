with HST NICMOS Camera 2. The nucleus is dominated by a bright, unresolved
source, polarized at a level of 6.0 pm 1.2% with a position angle of 122degr pm
1.5degr. There are two polarized lobes extending up to 8'' northeast and
southwest of the nucleus. The polarized flux in both lobes is quite clumpy,
with the maximum polarization occurring in the southwest lobe at a level of 17%
when smoothed to 0.23'' resolution. The perpendiculars to the polarization
vectors in these two lobes point back to the intense unresolved nuclear source
to within one 0.076'' Camera 2 pixel, thereby confirming that this is the
illuminating source of the scattered light and therefore the probable AGN
central engine. Whereas the polarization of the nucleus is probably caused by
dichroic absorption, the polarization in the lobes is almost certainly caused
by scattering, with very little contribution from dichroic absorption. Features
in the polarized lobes include a gap at a distance of about 1'' from the
nucleus toward the southwest lobe and a ``knot'' of emission about 5''
northeast of the nucleus. Both features had been discussed by ground-based
observers, but they are much better defined with the high spatial resolution of
NICMOS. The northeast knot may be the side of a molecular cloud that is facing
the nucleus, which cloud may be preventing the expansion of the northeast radio
lobe at the head of the radio synchrotron-radiation-emitting jet. We also
report the presence of two ghosts in the Camera 2 polarizers. These had not
been detected previously (Hines et al. 2000) because they are relatively faint
and require observations of a source with a large dynamic range.

during type I X-ray bursts with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer in order to
establish the stability of the mechanism underlying the oscillations. Our
sample contains 68 pulse trains detected in a search of 159 bursts from 8
accreting neutron stars. As a first step, we confirm that the oscillations
usually drift upward in frequency by about 1% toward an apparent saturation
frequency. Previously noted anomalies, such as drifts toward lower frequencies
as the oscillations disappear (``spin-down'' episodes) and instances of two
signals present simultaneously at frequencies separated by a few Hz, occur in
5% of oscillations. Having verified the generally accepted description of burst
oscillations, we proceed to study the coherence of the oscillations during
individual bursts, and the dispersion in the asymptotic frequencies in bursts
observed over five years. On short time scales, we find that 30% of the
oscillation trains do not appear to evolve smoothly in phase. This suggests
either that two signals are present simultaneously with a frequency difference
too small to resolve (< 1 Hz), that the frequency evolution is discontinuous,
or that discrete phase jumps occur. On time scales of years, the maximum
frequencies of the oscillations exhibit fractional dispersions of < 0.004. In
the case of 4U 1636-536, this dispersion is uncorrelated with the known orbital
phase, which indicates that a mechanism besides orbital Doppler shifts prevents
the oscillations from appearing perfectly stable. We interpret these results
under the assumption that the oscillations originate from anisotropies in the
emission from the surfaces of these rotating neutron stars. (Abridged)

the sample is corrected according to the precepts introduced by Teerikorpi
(1987).
  We adopt a constant slope (the one obtained with LMC Cepheids). The
correction for incompleteness bias introduce an uncertainty which depends on
each galaxy. On the mean, this uncertainty is small (0.04 mag) but it may reach
0.3 mag. We show that the un- certainty due to the correction of the extinction
is small (propably less than 0.05 mag.). The correlation between the
metallicity and the morphological type of the host galaxy sug- gests us to
reduce the application to spiral galaxies in order to bypass the problem of
metallicity. We suspect that the adopted PL slopes are not valid for all
morphological types of galaxies. This may induce a mean systematic shift of 0.1
mag on distance moduli.

near-infrared spectra of extremely cool objects are such that the Y-H and Y-K

mid L, substantially more rapidly than J-H or H-K which span a smaller total

having colors similar to those of warmer M and L stars. Use of the Y-band
filter is nonetheless promising for easy identification of low-mass stars and
brown dwarfs, especially at young ages. The slope of the interstellar reddening
vector within this filter is A_Y = 0.38 x A_V. Reddening moves stars nearly
along the YHK dwarf color sequence making it more difficult to distinguish

from the sources by using a simple systematic approach to model the continuum.
We find large variations in the wavelength and width of the extracted profiles
of the ``30'' micron feature. We modelled the whole range of profiles in a
simple way by using magnesium sulfide (MgS) dust grains with a MgS grain
temperature different from the continuum temperature. The systematic change in
peak positions can be explained by cooling of MgS grains as the star evolves
off the AGB. In several sources we find that a residual emission excess at ~26
micron can also be fitted using MgS grains but with a different grains shape
distribution. The profiles of the ``30'' micron feature in planetary nebulae
are narrower than our simple MgS model predicts. We discuss the possible
reasons for this difference. We find a sample of warm carbon-stars with very
cold MgS grains. We discuss possible causes for this phenomenon. We find no
evidence for rapid destruction of MgS during the planetary nebula phase and
conclude that the MgS may survive to be incorporated in the ISM.

supports the primordial origin of lithium in metal-poor stars. Taking the above

in GRBs) are controlled by the same basic physics, despite the very different
lifetimes and behavior. To this end we explore some general characteristics of
blazars, GRBs and superluminal galactic sources, such as their bulk Lorentz
factors, the power of their jets compared with what they can extract through
accretion, and the value of the magnetic field, close to the black hole, needed
to extract the spin energy of a rotating black hole. We find remarkable
similarities, namely that the outflowing mass rate is of the order of 1 per
cent of the accretion mass rate in all systems, and that the value of the
magnetic field required to efficiently extract the spin energy of the black
hole is of the order of the gravitational energy density of the matter close to
the gravitational radius. We then go on to discuss the way in which the energy
in bulk relativistic motion can be transformed into beamed radiation, and
consider the possibility that all three classes of sources could work in the
same way, namely by a intermittent release of relativistic plasma at the base
of the jet and thus with similar efficiency. Different patches of material,
with slightly different velocities, collide at some distance from the black
hole, producing the radiation we see.

6940, and UGC 6969. For the main galaxy, the HI distribution is regular with a
low level radial extension outside the stellar disc. However, at exactly the
region of the bar, there is a pronounced central HI hole in the gas
distribution. Likely gas has been transported inwards by the bar and because of
the emptyness of the hole no large accretion events can have happened in recent
galactic times. The gas kinematics is very regular and it is demonstrated that
the influence of the bar potential on the velocity field is negligible. A
precise and extended rotation curve has been derived showing some distinct
features which can be explained by the non-exponential radial light
distribution of NGC 3992. The decomposition of the rotation curve gives a
slight preference for a sub maximal disc, though a range of disc contributions,
up to a maximum disc situation fits nearly equally well. For such a maximum
disc contribution, which might be expected in order to generate and maintain
the bar, the required mass-to-light ratio is large but not exceptional.

select OB stars (hence the concentration on low latitudes), the small number of
bright metal-deficient giant candidates noted during this survey provide
interesting information on the metal-weak thick disk (MWTD) population.
  The kinematics of the LSE giants indicate the presence of a rapidly rotating

orbital eccentricity of the LSE giants as a function of [Fe/H], and conclude
that the local fraction (i.e., within 1 kpc from the Sun) of metal-poor stars
that might be associated with the MWTD is on the order of 30%-40% at abundances
below [Fe/H] = -1.0. Contrary to recent analyses of previous (much larger)
samples of non-kinematically selected metal-poor stars, we find that this
relatively high fraction of local metal-poor stars associated with the MWTD may
extend to metallicities below [Fe/H] = -1.6, much lower than had been
considered before. We identify a subsample of 11 LSE stars that are very likely
to be members of the MWTD, based on their derived kinematics; the lowest
metallicity among these stars is [Fe/H] = -2.35. Implications of these results

formation and the Salpeter initial mass function with an upper mass limit of

distribution ends quite abruptly at the optical edges. Velocity fields have

equal dark matter halos. When comparing the position-velocity diagrams of the
two brightest galaxies, UGC 6923 and UGC 6969, it is obvious that the rotation
curve of the latter has a shape closer to solid body than the former, yet the
same maximum rotational level is reached. This is likely generated by the equal
dark matter halos in combination with UGC 6923 being a factor five more
luminous than UGC 6969 and so its luminous matter gives a higher contribution
to the rotation in the inner regions. An NFW-CDMLambda dark halo is consistent
with the observed rotation curve of UGC 6923 but not consistent with the
rotation curve of UGC 6969. If the NGC 3992 group is part of the Ursa Major
cluster, then the I-band M/L ratio of NGC 3992 has to be at least 1.35 times as
large as that of the average spiral galaxy in the cluster. On the other hand,
equal M/L ratios can be achieved when the NGC 3992 group is placed more than 3

exponential growth of the norm of a typical vector in the tangent space. For an
N-particle Hamiltonian system, with a smooth Hamiltonian of the type p^2 +
v(q), the evolution of tangent vectors is governed by the Hessian matrix V of
the potential. Ergodicity implies that the Lyapunov exponent is independent of
initial conditions on the energy shell, which can then be chosen randomly
according to the microcanonical distribution. In this way a stochastic process
V(t) is defined, and the evolution equation for tangent vectors can now be seen
as a stochastic differential equation. An equation for the evolution of the
average squared norm of a tangent vector can be obtained using the standard
theory in which the average propagator is written as a cummulant expansion. We
show that if cummulants higher than the second one are discarded, the Lyapunov
exponent can be obtained by diagonalizing a small-dimension matrix, which, in
some cases, can be as small as 3x3. In all cases the matrix elements of the
propagator are expressed in terms of correlation functions of the stochastic
process. We discuss the connection between our approach and an alternative
theory, the so-called geometric method.

double stubs attached to them periodically, is studied systematically in the
presence of a weak spin-orbit coupling that makes the electrons precess. By an
appropriate choice of the waveguide length and of the stub parameters injected
spin-polarized electrons can be blocked completely and the transmission shows a
periodic and nearly square-type behavior, with values 1 and 0, with wide gaps
when only one mode is allowed to propagate in the waveguide. A similar behavior
is possible for a certain range of the stub parameters even when two-modes can
propagate in the waveguide and the conductance is doubled. Such a structure is
a good candidate for establishing a realistic spin transistor. A further
modulation of the spin current can be achieved by inserting defects in a
finite-number stub superlattice. Finite-temperature effects on the spin
conductance are also considered.

mechanisms is applied in a theoretical study of carrier transport across
potential barriers at grain boundaries in microcrystalline semiconducting
materials. In the unified model, the conductance depends on the detailed
structure of the band edge profile and in a nonlinear way on the carrier mean
free path. Equilibrium band edge profiles are calculated within the trapping
model for samples made up of a linear chain of identical grains. Quantum
corrections allowing for tunneling are included in the calculation of electron
mobilities. The dependence of the mobilities on carrier mean free path, grain
length, number of grains, and temperature is examined, and appreciable
departures from the results of the thermionic-field-emission model are found.
Specifically, the unified model is applied in an analysis of Hall mobility data
for n-type microcrystalline Si thin films in the range of thermally activated
transport. Owing mainly to the effect of tunneling, potential barrier heights
derived from the data are substantially larger than the activation energies of
the Hall mobilities. The specific features of the unified model, however,
cannot be resolved within the rather large uncertainties of the analysis.

solving the classical Yang-Mills equations in real time, and find that the

mu^-)/Br(B_s -> mu^+ mu^-), since (i) the theoretical errors cancel to a large
extent, and (ii) it offers a theoretically clean way of extracting the ratio
|V_{td}/V_{ts}| in the Standard Model (SM), which predicts R_SM ~
|V_{td}/V_{ts}|^2 ~ O(10^{-2}). Exploring three different scenarios of modified
minimal flavour violation, we find that part of the MSSM parameter space can
accommodate large Br(B_{d,s} -> mu^+ mu^-) branching fractions, while being
consistent with various experimental constraints. More importantly, we show
that the ratio R can be as large as O(1), while the individual branching
fractions may be amenable to detection by ongoing experiments. We conclude that
within the MSSM with large tan(beta) the decay rates of B_{d} -> mu^+ mu^- and
B_{s} -> mu^+ mu^- can be of comparable size even in the case where flavour

that our model reproduces the behavior of the quark condensate predicted by the
model-independent relation $<\bar qq>_{\rho} = <\bar

a second-order phase transition for the restoration of chiral symmetry. That
restoration is about 80% at twice nuclear matter density for the model
considered in this work. We also find that the part of the quark self-energy

the classical solitons that survive in the noncommutative space, and they turn

prescission neutrons are calculated in a statistical model with as well as
without a single swoop description of fission and they are found to differ in
the transition region. We however find that the difference is marginal and
hence a single swoop picture of fission though not strictly valid in the

by some physicists in the latter portion of his career. In addition some
historians have been less than kind to him regarding this portion of his work.
However, detailed analysis of how this work got started shows that Eddington's
theories were not as outlandish as they are often purported to be. His entire
theory rested on the use of quantum mechanical methods of uncertainty in the
reference frames of relativity. Though the work was ultimately not fruitful, in
hindsight it did foreshadow several later results in physics and his methods
were definitely rigorous. In addition, his philosophy regarding determinism and
uncertainty was actually fairly orthodox for his time. This work begins by
looking at Eddington's life and philosophy and uses this as a basis to explore
his work with uncertainty.

modified by two hypotheses: state vector reduction is a well-defined process,
and strict local causality applies. The first of these holds in some versions
of Copenhagen quantum theory and need not necessarily imply practically
testable deviations from ordinary quantum theory. The second implies that
measurement events which are spacelike separated have no non-local
correlations. To test this prediction, which sharply differs from standard
quantum theory, requires a precise theory of state vector reduction.
  Formally speaking, any precise version of causal quantum theory defines a
local hidden variable theory. However, causal quantum theory is most naturally
seen as a variant of standard quantum theory. For that reason it seems a more
serious rival to standard quantum theory than local hidden variable models
relying on the locality or detector efficiency loopholes.
  Some plausible versions of causal quantum theory are not refuted by any Bell
experiments to date, nor is it obvious that they are inconsistent with other
experiments. They evade refutation via a neglected loophole in Bell experiments
-- the {\it collapse locality loophole} -- which exists because of the possible
time lag between a particle entering a measuring device and a collapse taking
place. Fairly definitive tests of causal versus standard quantum theory could
be made by observing entangled particles separated by $\approx 0.1$ light
seconds.

measurements on entangled systems are correlated in a way that cannot be
reproduced by local hidden variables, they cannot be used for superluminal
signalling. As Czachor, Gisin and Polchinski pointed out, this is not true for
general nonlinear modifications of the Schroedinger equation. Excluding
superluminal signalling has thus been taken to rule out most nonlinear versions
of quantum theory. The no superluminal signalling constraint has also been used
for alternative derivations of the optimal fidelities attainable for imperfect
quantum cloning and other operations.
  These results apply to theories satisfying the rule that their predictions
for widely separated and slowly moving entangled systems can be approximated by
non-relativistic equations of motion with respect to a preferred time
coordinate. This paper describes a natural way in which this rule might fail to
hold. In particular, it is shown that quantum readout devices which display the
values of localised pure states need not allow superluminal signalling,
provided that the devices display the values of the states of entangled
subsystems as defined in a non-standard, but natural, way. It follows that any
locally defined nonlinear evolution of pure states can be made consistent with
Minkowski causality.
