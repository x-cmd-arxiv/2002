resolution has been designed and built at Steward Observatory and tested at the
Starfire Optical Range (SOR) 1.5 m telescope. It is the first spectrograph to
take advantage of diffraction-limited images provided by adaptive optics in
order to achieve a potential resolving power of $R \sim 600,000$. The
wavelength coverage in a single exposure is about 300 \AA, which is
approximately 100 times that of conventional spectrographs operating at
comparable resolution. This was achieved by recording 60 cross-dispersed orders
across the $18\times 18$ mm$^2$ area of the CCD detector. The total efficiency
of the system, including the sky and telescope transmission, spectrograph and
CCD detector, is measured to be 1.3% at peak, much higher than that of other
ultra-high-resolution spectrographs. Sample stellar spectra with $R \sim
250,000$ are presented.

prescriptions for galaxy feedback on the IGM to the evolved simulation. These
include the effect of photoionizing background radiation coming from galactic

IGM, and another, kinetic model for winds, which are assumed to evacuate
cavities in the IGM around galaxies. We find that only the latter is able to

viable, but predicts very different galaxy properties (including clustering)

emphasize that the general properties of the disk, such as disk flux, near side

using ISM-like dust grains, without the presence of either circumstellar disks
or large dust grains, as had previously been suggested. A single parameter
phase function is fitted to the observed azimuthal variation in disk flux,
providing a lower limit on the median grain size of 0.23 micron. Our analysis,

study of grain growth in T Tauri disk systems through scattered light lies in
the uncertain ISM dust grain properties. Finally, we use the 9 year baseline of

that the binary is coplanar with the circumbinary ring. We find that the

a constant ionization parameter. Using a sample of objects with broad-line
radii determined from reverberation mapping it is shown that the FWHM of MgII
and H beta are consistent with following an exact one-to-one relation, as
expected if both H beta and MgII are emitted at the same radius from the
central ionizing source. The resulting virial black-hole mass estimator based
on rest-frame UV observables is shown to reproduce black-hole mass measurements
based on reverberation mapping to within a factor of 2.5 (1 sigma). Finally,
the new UV black-hole mass estimator is shown to produce identical results to
the established optical (H beta) estimator when applied to 128
intermediate-redshift (0.3<z<0.9) quasars drawn from the Large Bright Quasar
Survey and the radio-selected Molonglo quasar sample. We therefore conclude
that the new UV virial black-hole mass estimator can be reliably used to
estimate the black-hole masses of quasars from z~0.25 through to the peak epoch
of quasar activity at z~2.5 via optical spectroscopy alone.

because the Markovian perturbations of the Kolmogorov flows associated with the
classical and quantum noises result in the perturbed group of transformations
which can be decomposed in the sum of a part associated with deterministic
stochastic processes lying in the past and a part associated with the noise
isomorphic to the initial one. This decomposition allows to obtain some analog
of the Wold decomposition for classical stationary processes excluding a
nondeterministic part of the process in the case of the stationary quantum
stochastic processes on the von Neumann factors which are the Markovian
perturbations of the quantum noises. For the classical stochastic process with
noncorrelated increaments it is constructed the model of Markovian
perturbations describing all Markovian cocycles up to a unitary equivalence of

pulse which encounters a localized nonlinear defect, that may be either static
or breather-like one (the model with the static defect applies to an optical
pulse in a long fiber link with an inserted additional section of a nonlinear
fiber). In the case when the host waveguide is linear, the pulse has a Gaussian
shape. In that case, an immediate result of its interaction with the nonlinear
defect can be found in an exact analytical form, amounting to transformation of
the incoming Gaussian into an infinite array of overlapping Gaussian pulses.
Further evolution of the array in the linear host medium is found numerically
by means of the Fourier transform. An important ingredient of the linear medium
is the third-order dispersion, that eventually splits the array into individual
pulses. If the host medium is nonlinear, the input pulse is taken as a
fundamental soliton. The soliton is found to be much more resistant to the
action of the nonlinear defect than the Gaussian pulse in the linear host
medium. In this case, the third-order-dispersion splits the soliton proper and
wavepackets generated by the action of the defect.
