in a first paper, we go on and include further physical ingredients that are
mostly pertinent to galactic nuclei, namely the presence of a central (growing)
black hole (BH) and collisions between MS stars. Stars that venture too close
to the BH are destroyed by the tidal field. This process is a channel to feed
the BH and a way to produce accretion flares. Collisions between stars have

realized a variety of tests whose results are reported here. This unique code,

systematics. On scales larger than 10 arcminutes, we find no ``B''-mode. On
smaller scales we find a small, but significant ``B''-mode. This signal is also

limit the cosmic shear analysis to galaxies with 22<R_C<24. We derive joint
constraints on Omega_m and sigma_8, by marginalizing over Gamma, Omega_Lambda
and the source redshift distribution, using different priors. We obtain a
conservative constraint of $\sigma_8=0.45^{+0.09}_{-0.12} \Omega_m^{-0.55}$

consists of a narrow peak at 6.4 keV and a broad wing extended between 4.5-7.5
keV. An analysis of the long-term variations revealed that the feature became
variable only on a time scale longer than 1.5x10^6 s. Through a comparison with
the continuum variabilities, we found that the emission region of the excess
flux at 4.5-7.5 keV has an extent of 10^17 cm. The broad and skewed feature at
4.5-7.5 keV may be explained by the so-called ``disk-line'' model. If so, the
size of the line-emitting region, 10^17 cm, should be equal to several or
ten-times the Schwarzschild radius of the central black hole. This results in a
black hole mass of 10^11 solar mass, which may be too large for NGC4151. We
propose an alternative explanation for the broad and skewed feature, i.e. a
``reflection'' model, which can also reproduce the overall energy spectra very
well. In this model, cold matter with a sufficiently large column density is
irradiated by X-rays to produce a reflected continuum, which constitutes the
broad wing of the feature, and narrow fluorescent lines. The equivalent width
of the iron fluorescent line (~2 keV) and the upper limit of its width (sigma <
92 eV) are also consistent with this model. From these results and
considerations, we conclude that the ``disk-line'' model has difficulty to

chemical property of sample BCDs, we suggest two possibilities; (1) The H{\sc
i} gas in the envelope of BCDs is consumed to fuel their star-formation; and
(2) BCDs have a similar star-formation history. We also discuss morphological
evolution among dwarf galaxies. As long as gas-rich dwarfs are isolated, it is
difficult for them to evolve into dwarf ellipticals (dEs). When the H{\sc i}
envelope in gas-rich dwarfs is consumed in subsequent star-formation, a
morphological exchange between BCDs and dIrrs is still expected, consistent
with previous studies. If the SFR of gas-rich dwarfs was much higher than
$\psi_{\rm crit}$ in the past, interestingly, an evolutionary scenario from dEs
to gas-rich dwarfs is possible.

resolved into several distinct kinematic components, covering rest-frame

$z_{em}=0.3721$. For the majority of these absorption line regions, strong
evidence of partial covering of both the background continuum source and the

time at such a redshift, is consistent with an isothermal atmosphere up to half
the virial radius. The surface brightness profile, measured nearly up to the
virial radius, is well fitted by a beta-model, with beta =0.78[+0.06,-0.04] and
a core radius of thetac = 0.44[+0.06,-0.04] arcmin. We compared the properties

models: an Einstein - de Sitter Universe and a flat low density Universe with
Omega0=0.3. For both models, the scaled emission measure profile beyond the
core, the gas mass fraction and luminosity are consistent with the expectations
of the self-similar model of cluster formation, although a slightly better
agreement is obtained for a low density Universe. There is no evidence of a
central cooling flow, in spite of the apparent relaxed state of the cluster.
This is consistent with its estimated cooling time, larger than the age of the
Universe at the cluster redshift. The entropy profile shows a flat core with a
central entropy of ~ 140 keV cm^2, remarkably similar to the entropy floor
observed in nearby clusters, and a rising profile beyond typically 0.1 virial
radius. Implications of our results, in terms of non-gravitational physics in

distance from the centre. We also find that the virial masses of the clumps are
~3 times less than those derived from the CH3C2H column densities: we show that
a plausible explanation is that magnetic fields play an important role to
stabilise the clumps, which are on the verge of gravitational collapse.
Finally, we show that the CH3C2H line width increases for decreasing distance
from the clump centre: this effect is consistent with infall in the inner
regions of the clumps. We conclude that the clumps around UC HII regions are
likely to be transient (~10^(5) yr) entities, remnants of isothermal spheres
currently undergoing gravitational collapse: the high mass accretion rates
(~10^{-2} M_\odot yr^{-1}) lead to massive star formation at the centre of such

show that dust-to-gas ratio is largely varied owing to the change of dust
destruction efficiency that has two effects: (i) a significant contribution of
Type Ia supernovae to total supernova rate; (ii) variation of gas mass
contained in a star-forming region. While mass loss from BCDs was previously
thought to be the major cause for the variance of dust-to-gas ratio, we suggest
that the other two effects are also important. We finally discuss the

temperature $T_g$ without the need of introducing disorder of any kind. We
consider first a hamiltonian that takes into account only a four--spin term
($\kappa=0$), where a first order phase transition is well established. By
studying the relaxation properties at low temperatures we confirm that the
model exhibits two distinct regimes. For $T_g< T < T_c$, with long lived
metastability and a supercooled phase, the approach to equilibrium is well
described by a stretched exponential. For $T<T_g$ the dynamics appears to be
logarithmic. We provide an accurate determination of $T_g$. We also determine
the evolution of particularly long lived configurations. Next, we consider the
case $\kappa=1$, where the plaquette term is absent and the gonihedric action
consists in a ferromagnetic Ising with fine-tuned next-to-nearest neighbour
interactions. This model exhibits a second order phase transition. The
consideration of the relaxation time for configurations in the cold phase

The integration and the event generation are performed within the newly

generation system to hadron collisions. This program is so designed that it can
be embedded in a general-purpose event generator PYTHIA version 6.1. PYTHIA
adds the initial- and final-state parton showers and simulates the
hadronization and decays to make generated events realistic. It should be

spacetime. It is a two dimensional nonlinear model, the lambda model, set to
govern the string worldsurface to remedy the failure of string theory. The
lambda model is formulated to cancel the infrared divergent effects of handles
at short distance on the worldsurface. The target manifold is the manifold of
background spacetimes. The coupling strength is the spacetime coupling
constant. The lambda model operates at 2d distance $\Lambda^{-1}$, very much
shorter than the 2d distance $\mu^{-1}$ where the worldsurface is seen. A large
characteristic spacetime distance $L$ is given by $L^2=\ln(\Lambda/\mu)$.
Spacetime fields of wave number up to 1/L are the local coordinates for the
manifold of spacetimes. The distribution of fluctuations at 2d distances
shorter than $\Lambda^{-1}$ gives the {\it a priori} measure on the target
manifold, the manifold of spacetimes. If this measure concentrates at a
macroscopic spacetime, then, nearby, it is a measure on the spacetime fields.
The lambda model thereby constructs a spacetime quantum field theory, cutoff at
ultraviolet distance $L$, describing physics at distances larger than $L$. The
lambda model also constructs an effective string theory with infrared cutoff
$L$, describing physics at distances smaller than $L$. The lambda model evolves
outward from zero 2d distance, $\Lambda^{-1} = 0$, building spacetime physics
starting from $L=\infty$ and proceeding downward in $L$. $L$ can be taken
smaller than any distance practical for experiments, so the lambda model, if
right, gives all actually observable physics. The harmonic surfaces in the
manifold of spacetimes are expected to have novel nonperturbative effects at
large distances.

of the same order of magnitude as the mass of the W-boson. The corrections to
the standard RG flow are derived to the leading order in the inverse mass of
the Higgs boson. According to the obtained RG equations, the scaling of the
free-energy density in the critical region and the value of the critical
temperature of the phase transition are found to be unaffected by the
finiteness of the Higgs-boson mass. The evolution of the Higgs mass itself is
also investigated and shown to be rather weak, that enables one to treat this
parameter as a constant. The same analysis is further performed in the
SU(N)-case at N>2, where the RG invariance is demonstrated to hold only
approximately, in a certain sense. Modulo this approximation, the critical

model of a passive scalar quantity advected by the Gaussian self-similar
velocity field with finite, and not small, correlation time. The inertial-range
energy spectrum of the velocity is chosen in the form $E(k)\propto
k^{1-2\eps}$, and the correlation time at the wavenumber $k$ scales as
$k^{-2+\eta}$. Inertial-range anomalous scaling for the structure functions and
other correlation functions emerges as a consequence of the existence in the
model of composite operators with negative scaling dimensions, identified with
anomalous exponents. For $\eta>\eps$, these exponents are the same as in the
rapid-change limit of the model; for $\eta<\eps$, they are the same as in the
limit of a time-independent (quenched) velocity field. For $\eps=\eta$ (local
turnover exponent), the anomalous exponents are nonuniversal through the
dependence on a dimensionless parameter, the ratio of the velocity correlation
time and the scalar turnover time. The universality reveals itself, however,
only in the second order of the $\eps$ expansion, and the exponents are derived
to order $O(\eps^{2})$, including anisotropic contributions. It is shown that,
for moderate $n$, the order of the structure function, and $d$, the space
dimensionality, finite correlation time enhances the intermittency in
comparison with the both limits: the rapid-change and quenched ones. The
situation changes when $n$ and/or $d$ become large enough: the correction to
the rapid-change limit due to the finite correlation time is positive (that is,
the anomalous scaling is suppressed), it is maximal for the quenched limit and
monotonically decreases as the correlation time tends to zero.

Specifically, we present a method to lower bound this communication cost even
when the amount of entanglement does not increase. Moreover, the bound applies
even if the initial state is supplemented with unlimited entanglement in the
form of EPR pairs, and the communication is allowed to be quantum mechanical.
  We then apply the method to the determination of the communication cost of
asymptotic entanglement concentration and dilution. While concentration is
known to require no communication whatsoever, the best known protocol for
dilution, discovered by Lo and Popescu [Phys. Rev. Lett. 83(7):1459--1462,
1999], requires a number of bits to be exchanged which is of the order of the
square root of the number of EPR pairs. Here we prove a matching lower bound of
the same asymptotic order, demonstrating the optimality of the Lo-Popescu
protocol up to a constant factor and establishing the existence of a
fundamental asymmetry between the concentration and dilution tasks.

several known lower bound methods that use the log-rank or the von Neumann

proving lower bounds on problems involving a promise or for which the ""hard""
