from a Roche lobe filling red giant. However, in our Galaxy, most of these
systems accrete sporadically as transients due to a thermal instability in the
accretion disk. Using the common criterion for disk instability (including
irradiation), we find that this mode of mass transfer leads to transient
accretion for at least 75% of the binary's life. Repeated Chandra observations
of elliptical galaxies should reveal this population. The recurrence times
might exceed 1000 years (depending on the orbital period at the onset of mass
transfer), and outbursts might last for 1-100 years. Mass transfering binaries
can also be formed in old populations via interactions in dense stellar
environments, such as globular clusters. These tend to have shorter orbital
periods and are more likely stable accretors, making them apparently a large
fraction of the elliptical's LMXB population.

X-ray halo. The halo center of NGC 1399 and NGC 507 is dominated by a bright
emission peak coincident with the position of the optical galaxy. This central
peak is not explained by cooling flow models and is likely to be produced by
kinetically heated stellar material. Within the effective radius, the hot gas
distribution is tracing the galactic potential due to luminous matter. At
larger distances the halo dynamics is dominated by dark matter extending on
group and cluster scales. The NGC 1399 complex morphology further requires that
the dark matter distribution has a hierarchical structure or that environmental
effects are producing departures from hydrostatic equilibrium. We found
significant density fluctuations in the hot gas distribution of both NGC 1399

radio-emitting plasma with the surrounding ISM. The remaining structures may be
the result of galaxy-galaxy encounters, wakes produced by the motion of the
galaxy through the ICM or may reflect the inhomogeneity of the cooling process
invoked by many authors to explain the failure of the standard cooling-flow
models. NGC 1404 represents a puzzling case since, despite its similarity with
dominant cluster members, significant differences are found in the hot gas
properties. These conflicting evidences can be explained by environmental
effects, such as stifling of galactic winds by the ICM. Finally, we studied the

bursts from weakly-magnetized neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries. Our
sample contains 59 oscillations from six sources observed with the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer. The oscillations that we examined occurred primarily during
the decaying portions of bursts, and lasted for several seconds each. We find
that the oscillations are as large as 15% during the declines of the bursts,
and they appear and disappear due to intrinsic variations in their fractional
amplitudes. However, the maxima in the amplitudes are not related to the
underlying flux in the burst. We derive folded profiles for each oscillation
train to study the pulse morphologies. The mean rms amplitudes of the
oscillations are 5%, although the eclipsing source MXB 1659-298 routinely
produces 10% oscillations in weak bursts. We also produce combined profiles
from all of the oscillations from each source. Using these pulse profiles, we
place upper limits on the fractional amplitudes of harmonic and half-frequency
signals of 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively (95% confidence). We then compare the
pulse morphologies to theoretical profiles from models with one or two
antipodal bright regions on the surface of a rotating neutron star. We find
that if one bright region is present on the star, it must either lie near the
rotational pole or cover nearly half the neutron star in order to be consistent
with the observed lack of harmonic signals. If an antipodal pattern is present,
the hot regions must form very near the rotational equator. We discuss how
these geometric constraints challenge current models for the production of
brightness variations on the surface of a neutron star. (abridged)

has entered a quiescent state several orders of magnitude fainter. We have
performed a 37 ksec Chandra observation of 4U 2129+47 to determine whether an
extended coronal structure also exists in quiescence. Total eclipses are found,
and the rapidity of the eclipse ingress and egress are used to place upper
limits on the size of the X-ray source. The spectrum is comprised of a soft
component plus a fairly hard power law tail. The former is seen to be
sinusoidally modulated over the orbital period in a manner consistent with
neutral column variations, possibly due to the interaction of an accretion
stream with a (small) disk about the neutron star. We fit realistic atmosphere
models to the soft spectra, and comment on the consistency of the spectra with
cooling neutron star models. It has been suggested that the 4U 2129+47 system

differential astrometry to show that the X-ray point source and F star are
spatially coincident to within 0.1"". We further compare newly determined upper

Balmer continuum. The rest equivalent width of Fe II (3000-3500 A) is ~30 A

between X-ray centroid and central dominant cD galaxy, which may be an
indicator of the presence of local dynamical activities of intracluster gas in
the central core and therefore, explain the discrepancy between X-ray and
lensing mass estimates, if any. The unprecedentedly high spatial resolution
achieved by Chandra allows us to precisely localize the X-ray centroid of Abell

by different lensing techniques available in the literature. Our analysis
confirms the existance of the discrepancy of a factor of $\sim2$ between X-ray
and lensing mass estimates in the central region of $r\approx0.2$ Mpc, although
the two methods yield essentially consistent result on large radii. If the
perfect coincidence between the X-ray center and the cD galaxy of Abell 1689
detected by Chandra observation is not a projection effect, the central mass
discrepancy between X-ray and lensing measurements may pose a challenge to our
conventional understanding of dynamical evolution of the intracluster gas in
the central regions of clusters.

to produce these two systems. In this scenario, the primary transfers its
envelope onto the secondary which is then the more massive of the two stars,
and indeed sufficiently massive later to produce a neutron star via a
supernova. The core of the primary produces a massive white dwarf which enters
into a common envelope with the core of the secondary when the latter evolves
off the main sequence. During the common envelope phase, the white dwarf and
the core of the secondary spiral together as the envelope is ejected. The
evolutionary history of PSR J1141-6545 and PSR B2303+46 differ after this
phase. In the case of PSR J1141--6545, the secondary (now a helium star)
evolves into contact transferring its envelope onto the white dwarf. We propose
that the vast majority of this material is in fact ejected from the system. The
remains of the secondary then explode as a supernova producing a neutron star.
Generally the white dwarf and neutron star will remain bound in tight, often
eccentric, systems resembling PSR J1141-6545. These systems will spiral in and
merge on a relatively short timescale and may make a significant contribution
to the population of gamma ray burst progenitors. In PSR B2303+46, the
helium-star secondary and white dwarf never come into contact. Rather the
helium star loses its envelope via a wind, which increases the binary
separation slightly. Only a small fraction of such systems will remain bound
when the neutron star is formed (as the systems are wider). Those systems which
are broken up will produce a population of high-velocity white dwarfs and
neutron stars.

evidence suggest that the gas in damped Lyman-alpha systems -- in whole or part

here, shows that the damped Lyman-alpha systems observed at lower redshift z
$<$ 2.3 are largely cool, while those seen at z $>$ 2.8 are warm (though not

constructed detailed numerical models of H2 formation under the conditions of

many orders of magnitude even in cool diffuse clouds, as long as the ambient

the most diffuse conditions, H2 formation will be dominated by slow gas-phase
processes not involving grains, and a minimum molecular fraction in the range

thermodynamics. The black hole thermodynamics denotes a nice correspondence
between black hole kinematics and the laws of ordinary thermodynamics, but has
been so far considered only in an asymptotically flat case. Does such the
correspondence rely strongly on the feature of the gravity vanishing at the
infinity? In order to resolve this question, it should be considered for the
first to extend the Hawking radiation to a case with a dynamical boundary
condition like an expanding universe. Therefore the Hawking radiation in an
expanding universe is discussed in this paper. As a concrete model of a black
hole in an expanding universe, we use the swiss cheese universe which is the
spacetime including a Schwarzschild black hole in the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. Further for simplicity, our calculation is
performed in two dimension. The resultant spectrum of the Hawking radiation
measured by a comoving observer is generally different from a thermal one. We
find that the qualitative behavior of the non-thermal spectrum is of dumping
oscillation as a function of the frequency measured by the observer, and that
the intensity of the Hawking radiation is enhanced by the presence of a
cosmological expansion. It is appropriate to say that it a black hole with an
asymptotically flat boundary condition stays in a lowest energy thermal
equilibrium state, and that, once a black hole is put into an expanding
universe, it is excited to a non-equilibrium state and emits its mass energy
with stronger intensity than a thermal one.

summarized. Various issues concerning the relevance of resummation for
observables at TeV colliders is examined. Improvements to algorithms of jet
reconstruction are discussed and predictions for diphoton and photon pi-zero
production at the LHC are made for kinematic variables of interest regarding
searches for a Higgs boson decaying into two photons. Finally, several
improvements implemented in Monte-Carlo event generators are documented.

moderately narrow peak at the high part of the dipion mass spectrum, can be
interpreted as the isoscalar member of the scalar nonet with a large $f_0
K\bar{K}$ coupling and an $f_0\pi\pi$ coupling suppressed by almost ideal
$\sigma$-$f_0$ mixing. Indeed, the mixing angle in the flavour basis is found
to be $\phi_{S}\approx -6^\circ$, if the $f_0$-propagator is approximated by a
simple Breit-Wigner, or $\phi_{S}\approx -9^\circ$, if an improved two-channel
analysis is performed. The $\sigma(500)$ resonance, which is then strongly
coupled to pion pairs, yields a tiny contribution because, in our approach, its
coupling to kaon pairs is proportional to $m^2_\sigma-m^2_K$ and thus quite
small.

assuming that at least the ratio between strange and non-strange constituent
quarks survives in the final hadrons, the apparent undersaturation of strange
particle phase space observed in the data can be accounted for. In this
framework, the enhancement of relative strangeness production in heavy ion
collisions in comparison with elementary collisions is mainly owing to the

stable relative to various phenomena included in calculations. The dip is well
confirmed by observations of AGASA, HiRes, Fly's Eye and Yakutsk detectors. The
best fit is reached at $\gamma_g =2.7$, with the allowed range 2.55 - 2.75. The
dip is used for energy calibration of the detectors. After the energy
calibration the fluxes and spectra of all three detectors agree perfectly, with
discrepancy between AGASA and HiRes at $E> 1\times 10^{20}$ eV being not
statistically significant. The agreement of the dip with observations should be
considered as confirmation of UHE proton interaction with CMB. The dip has two
flattenings. The high energy flattening at $E \approx 1\times 10^{19}$ eV
automatically explains ankle. The low-energy flattening at $E \approx 1\times
10^{18}$ eV provides the transition to galactic cosmic rays. This transition is
studied quantitatively. The UHECR sources, AGN and GRBs, are studied in a
model-dependent way, and acceleration is discussed. Based on the agreement of
the dip with existing data, we make the robust prediction for the spectrum at
$1\times 10^{18} - 1\times 10^{20}$ eV to be measured in the nearest future by
Auger detector.

been studied in the framework of the angular momentum projected generator
coordinate method with the Gogny force. It is shown that the N=8 neutron magic
number is preserved (in a dynamical sense) in \nuc{20}{Mg} leading to a
spherical ground state. For the magic numbers N=20 and N=28 this is not the
case and prolate deformed ground states are obtained. The method yields values
of the two neutron separation energies which are in much better agreement with
experiment than those obtained at the mean field level. It is also obtained
that \nuc{40}{Mg} is at the neutron dripline. Concerning the results for the
excitation energies of the $2^+$ excited states and their transition
probabilities to the ground state we observe a good agreement with the

multiple generators in the presence of ongoing background activity. While
source localization techniques or current source density estimation are usually
used to identify generators, application of blind source separation techniques
to obtain independent components has become more popular.
  We approach this problem by applying the Bayesian methodology to a more
physiologically-realistic source model. As it is generally accepted that single
trials vary in amplitude and latency, we incorporate this variability into the
model. Rather than making the unrealistic assumption that these cortical
components are independent of one another, our algorithm utilizes the
differential amplitude and latency variability of the evoked waveforms to
identify the cortical components. The algorithm is applied to
intracortically-recorded local field potentials in monkeys performing a
visuomotor task.

dark state which is present without the interference. Finally we examine a

coherently pumped atom along the axis of a high--Q cavity is studied. The
internal dynamics of the atomic dipole strongly coupled to the cavity field is
treated by a non-perturbative quantum mechanical model, while the effect of the
cavity on the external motion is described classically in terms of the
analytically obtained linear friction and diffusion coefficients. Efficient
cavity-induced damping is found which leads to steady-state temperatures
well-below the Doppler limit. We reveal a mathematical symmetry between the
results here and for a similar system where, instead of the atom, the cavity
field is pumped. The cooling process is strongly enhanced in a degenerate
multimode cavity. Both the temperature and the number of scattered photons
during the characteristic cooling time exhibits a significant reduction with
increasing number of modes involved in the dynamics. The residual number of
spontaneous emissions in a cooling time for large mode degeneracy can reach and
even drop below the limit of a single photon.

follows from an additivity theorem for the capacity of the product of the
