(FUV) radiation from hot early type OB stars on clumps in star-forming
molecular clouds. Clumps in Photodissociation regions (PDRs) undergo external
heating which, if rapid, creates strong photoevaporative mass flows off the
clump surfaces, and drives shocks into the clumps, compressing them to high
densities. The clumps lose mass on relatively short timescales. The evolution
of an individual clump is found to be sensitive to its initial colunm density,
the temperature of the heated surface and the ratio of the ``turn-on time''
$t_{FUV}$ of the heating flux on a clump to its initial sound crossing-time
$t_{c}$.
  In this paper, we use spherical 1-D numerical hydrodynamic models as well as
approximate analytical models to study the evolution of turbulence-generated
and pressure-confined clumps in PDRs. Turbulent clumps evolve so that their
column densities are equal to a critical value determined by the local FUV
field, and typically have short photoevaporation timescales, $\sim 10^{4-5}$
years for a 1 M$_{\odot}$ clump in a typical star-forming region. Clumps that
are confined by an interclump medium may either get completely photoevaporated,
or may preserve a shielded core with a warm, dissociated, protective shell that
absorbs the incident FUV flux. We compare our results with observations of some
well-studied PDRs: the Orion Bar, M17SW, NGC 2023 and the Rosette Nebula. The
data are consistent with both interpretations of clump origin, with a slight
indication for favouring the turbulent model for clumps over pressure-confined
clumps.

  The spectra of the lensed QSO pair A and B with 0.38 arcsec separation were

the MgII doublet spectra of A and B separately. Although three velocity
components (v ~ -28, +5, +45 km/s) are known to exist in this MgII system

to the source A. Our results suggests that the size of the MgII absorbing
clouds is as small as 200 pc, which corresponds to the separation of A and B at
the redshift of the absorber. This is the first direct detection of the

the Sersic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or

disky and boxy components. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity
changes, and position-angle twists can be modeled accurately in 2-D. When

at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two

which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular
galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A
useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point

eccentric disk hypothesis of Tremaine, but whether the eccentric disk resulted
from the tidal disruption of an inbounding star cluster by a nuclear black
hole, or by an m=1 perturbation of a native nuclear disk, remains debatable. I
perform detailed 2-D decomposition of the M31 double nucleus in the Hubble
Space Telescope V-band to study the bulge structure and to address competing
formation scenarios of the eccentric disk. I deblend the double nucleus (P1 and
P2) and the bulge simultaneously using five Sersic and one Nuker components. P1
and P2 appear to be embedded inside an intermediate component (r_e=3.2"") that
is nearly spherical (q=0.97+/-m0.02), while the main galaxy bulge is more
elliptical (q=0.81+/-0.01). The spherical bulge mass of 2.8x10^7 M_sol is
comparable to the supermassive black hole mass (3x10^7 M_sol). In the 2-D
decomposition, the bulge is consistent with being centered near the UV peak of
P2, but the exact position is difficult to pinpoint because of dust in the
bulge. P1 and P2 are comparable in mass. Within a radius r=1\arcsec of P2, the
relative mass fraction of the nuclear components is M_BH:M_bulge:P1: P2 =
4.3:1.2:1:0.7, assuming the luminous components have a common mass-to-light
ratio of 5.7. The eccentric disk as a whole (P1+P2) is massive, M ~ 2.1x10^7
M_sol, comparable to the black hole and the local bulge mass. As such, the
eccentric disk could not have been formed entirely out of stars that were
stripped from an inbounding star cluster. Hence, the more favored scenario is
that of a disk formed in situ by an m=1 perturbation, caused possibly by the
passing of a giant molecular cloud, or the passing/accretion of a small
globular cluster.

133, which has a cooling flow core, a central radio source, and a diffuse,
filamentary radio source which has been classified as a radio relic.
  The X-ray image shows that the core has a complex structure. The most
prominent feature is a ""tongue"" of emission which extends from the central cD
galaxy to the northwest and partly overlaps the radio relic. One possibility is
that this tongue is produced by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities through the
interaction between the cold gas around the cD galaxy and hot intracluster
medium. We estimate the critical velocity and time scale for the KH instability
to be effective for the cold core around the cD galaxy. We find that the KH
instability can disrupt the cold core if the relative velocity is >~400 km
s^-1. We compare the results with those of clusters in which sharp, undisrupted
cold fronts have been observed; in these clusters, the low temperature gas in
their central regions has a more regular distribution. In contrast to Abell
133, these cluster cores have longer timescales for the disruption of the core
by the KH instability when they are normalized to the timescale of the cD
galaxy motion. Thus, the other cores are less vulnerable to KH instability.
Another possible origin of the tongue is that it is gas which has been uplifted
by a buoyant bubble of nonthermal plasma that we identify with the observed
radio relic. From the position of the bubble and the radio estimate of the age
of the relic source, we estimate avelocity of ~700 km s^-1 for the bubble. The
structure of the bubble and this velocity are consistent with numerical models
for such buoyant bubbles. (abridged)

low-mass (0.3 - 0.4 solar mass) ``hybrid'' white dwarfs (with CO cores and
thick helium mantles). Stable mass transfer is possible if in the initial
stages of mass exchange mass is lost from the system, taking away the specific
orbital angular momentum of the accretor (``isotropic re-emission''). The
excess of neon in the transferred matter is due to chemical fractionation of
the white dwarf which has to occur prior to the Roche lobe overflow by the
donor. The estimated lower limit of the orbital periods of the systems with
neon-enriched donors is close to 10 min. We show that the X-ray pulsar 4U

line luminosity, $\Phi \propto L_{OH}^{-0.64}$ per Mpc^3 per dex, and is
well-sampled for 10^{2.2} L(sun) < L_{OH} < 10^{3.8} L(sun). The OH luminosity
function is incorporated into predictions of the detectability and areal
density of OHMs in high redshift OH surveys for a variety of current and
planned telescopes and merging evolution scenarios parameterized by (1+z)^m in
the merger rate ranging from m=0 (no evolution) to m=8 (extreme evolution). Up
to dozens of OHMs may be detected per square degree per 50 MHz by a survey
reaching an rms noise of 100 microJy per 0.1 MHz channel. An adequately
sensitive ``OH Deep Field'' would significantly constrain the evolution
exponent m even if no detections are made. In addition to serving as luminous
tracers of massive mergers, OHMs may also trace highly obscured nuclear
starburst activity and the formation of binary supermassive black holes.

repulsive cosine interaction is well known to display spatially inhomogeneous
structures of extraordinary stability starting from certain low energy initial
conditions. The object of this paper is to show in a detailed manner how these
structures arise and to explain their stability. By a convenient canonical
transformation we rewrite the Hamiltonian in such a way that fast and slow
variables are singled out and the canonical coordinates of a collective mode
are naturally introduced. If, initially, enough energy is put in this mode, its
decay can be extremely slow. However, both analytical arguments and numerical
simulations suggest that these structures eventually decay to the spatially
uniform equilibrium state, although this can happen on impressively long time
scales. Finally, we heuristically introduce a one-particle time dependent
Hamiltonian that well reproduces most of the observed phenomenology.

for some fixed d and distances are computed according to geometric distances,
determined by some norm. We show that for any polyhedral norm, the problem of
finding a tour of maximum length can be solved in polynomial time. If
arithmetic operations are assumed to take unit time, our algorithms run in time
O(n^{f-2} log n), where f is the number of facets of the polyhedron determining
the polyhedral norm. Thus for example we have O(n^2 log n) algorithms for the
cases of points in the plane under the Rectilinear and Sup norms. This is in
contrast to the fact that finding a minimum length tour in each case is
NP-hard. Our approach can be extended to the more general case of quasi-norms
with not necessarily symmetric unit ball, where we get a complexity of
O(n^{2f-2} log n).
  For the special case of two-dimensional metrics with f=4 (which includes the
Rectilinear and Sup norms), we present a simple algorithm with O(n) running
time. The algorithm does not use any indirect addressing, so its running time
remains valid even in comparison based models in which sorting requires Omega(n
\log n) time. The basic mechanism of the algorithm provides some intuition on
why polyhedral norms allow fast algorithms.
  Complementing the results on simplicity for polyhedral norms, we prove that
for the case of Euclidean distances in R^d for d>2, the Maximum TSP is NP-hard.
This sheds new light on the well-studied difficulties of Euclidean distances.

compactification of the extra dimension(s) leads to a breakdown of the gauge
symmetry and/or supersymmetry. We examine a particular class of
higher-dimensional models exhibiting supersymmetry and SU(5) or SO(10) GUT
symmetry. SUSY breaking occurs on a hidden brane, and is communicated to the
visible brane via gaugino mediation. Non-universal gaugino masses are developed
at the compactification scale as a consequence of a restricted gauge symmetry
on the hidden brane. In this case, the compactification scale is at or slightly
below the GUT scale. We examine the parameter space of such models where
gaugino masses are related due to a Pati-Salam symmetry on the hidden brane. We
find limited but significant regions of model parameter space where a viable
spectra of SUSY matter is generated. Our results are extended to the more
general case of three independent gaugino masses; here we find that large
parameter space regions open up for large values of the U(1) gaugino mass M_1.
We also find the relic density of neutralinos for these models to be generally
below expectations from cosmological observations, thus leaving room for hidden
sector states to make up the bulk of cold dark matter. Finally, we evaluate the
branching fraction BF(b -> s gamma) and muon anomalous magnetic moment a_\mu.

the corrections to these electroweak precision observables and carry out a

larger than 1, we find that the 95% C.L. lower bound on the matching (heavy

It has been shown that appropriate parton distribution functions are uniquely

commonly used MSbar parton distribution functions. At small x the differences
are large, which demonstrates the importance of using the correct parton

between the world-sheet analysis, that first exhibited many of the novel

objects, D-branes and O-planes, contributed by many other colleagues, and most
notably by J. Polchinski. We therefore proceed through a number of prototype
examples, starting from the bosonic string and moving on to ten-dimensional
fermionic strings and their toroidal and orbifold compactifications, in an
attempt to guide the reader in a self-contained journey to the more recent
developments related to the breaking of supersymmetry.

obtain a further equivalent criterion for Dedekind completeness of ordered

is shown that over all closed bounded intervals in any monotone incomplete
ordered field, there are continuous not uniformly continuous unbounded
functions whose ranges are not closed, and continuous 1-1 functions which map
every interior point to an interior point (of the image) but are not open.
These are achieved using appropriate nets cofinal in gaps or coinitial in their
complements. In our third main theorem, an ordered field is constructed which
has parametrically definable regular gaps but no $\emptyset$-definable
divergent Cauchy functions (while we show that, in either of the two cases
where parameters are or are not allowed, any definable divergent Cauchy
function gives rise to a definable regular gap). Our proof for the mentioned

of the orbits of the turning points affects the inverse limit. We show that if
$f$ has finitely many turning points each on a finite orbit then the inverse

limit space at the points that correspond to points in the $\omega$-limit set
of $f$ when the turning points of $f$ are not necessarily on a finite orbit.
This leads to a new result regarding inverse limits of maps of the interval.

an interesting feature, capturable in many categories, namely in categories

class of all embeddings, the subclass of all pushout-stable
$\mathcal{M}$-morphisms (that is, of those $\mathcal{M}$-morphisms whose
pushout along an arbitrary morphism always belongs to $\mathcal{M}$) is of the

$m:X \to Y$ such that the map $Hom(m,A): Hom(Y,A) \to Hom(X,A)$ is surjective.
We study this phenomenon. We show that, under mild assumptions, the reflective
hull of such a space $A$ is the smallest $\mathcal{M}$-reflective subcategory
of $\mathcal{B}$; furthermore, the opposite category of this reflective hull is
equivalent to a reflective subcategory of the Eilenberg-Moore category

the space of continuous homomorphisms from $G$ into $T$ in the compact-open
topology. A dense subgroup $D$ of $G$ determines $G$ if the (necessarily
continuous) surjective isomorphism $\hat{G} \twoheadrightarrow \hat{D}$ given
by $h\mapsto h|D$ is a homeomorphism, and $G$ is determined if each dense
subgroup of $G$ determines $G$. The principal result in this area, obtained
independently by L. Aussenhofer and M. J. Chasco}, is the following: Every
metrizable group is determined. The authors offer several related results,
including these. (1) There are (many) nonmetrizable, noncompact, determined
groups. (2) If the dense subgroup $D_i$ determines $G_i$ with $G_i$ compact,
then $\oplus_i D_i$ determines $\Pi_i G_i$. In particular, if each $G_i$ is
compact then $\oplus_i G_i$ determines $\Pi_i G_i$. (3) Let $G$ be a locally
bounded group and let $G^+$ denote $G$ with its Bohr topology. Then $G$ is
determined if and only if ${G^+}$ is determined. (4) Let $non(N)$ be the least
cardinal $\kappa$ such that some $X \subseteq T}$ of cardinality $\kappa$ has
positive outer measure. No compact $G$ with $w(G)\geq non(N)$ is determined;
thus if $non(N)=\aleph_1$ (in particular if CH holds), an infinite compact
group $G$ is determined if and only if w(G)=\omega$. Question. Is there in ZFC
a cardinal $\kappa$ such that a compact group $G$ is determined if and only if
$w(G)<\kappa$? Is $\kappa=non(N)$? $\kappa=\aleph_1$?

large cross sections. A model of deep-inelastic transfer (DIT) for the primary
interaction stage and the statistical evaporation code GEMINI for the

distributions. The results have also been compared with the EPAX
parametrization of high-energy fragmentation yields. The experimental data show
an enhancement in the production of neutron-rich isotopes close to the

neutron distribution (neutron ``skin'') of the 64Ni target in peripheral
interactions of 86Kr with 64Ni. The large cross sections of such reactions near
the Fermi energy, involving peripheral nucleon exchange, suggest that, not only
the N/Z of the projectile and the target, but also the N/Z distribution at the

rare isotopes. This synthesis approach may offer a fruitful pathway to
extremely neutron-rich nuclei, towards the neutron-drip line.

a `relativized' model are used with the 3P0 model to provide predictions for
the strength and analytical momentum dependence of the strong vertices.
Intermediate states include all the lightest pseudoscalar and vector mesons and
corresponding baryons required to provide a complete set of spin-flavor
symmetry related baryon-meson states. The sum over intermediate-state baryons
is extended to include the second (N=3) band of negative-parity excited states,
to provide the most complete calculation of its kind to date.
  It is found that with reduced-strength one-gluon-exchange interactions
between the quarks, roughly half of the splitting between the nucleon and Delta
ground states arises from loop effects. The effects of such loops on the
spectrum of negative-parity excited states are also studied, and it is found
that the resulting splittings are sensitive to configuration mixing caused by
the residual interactions. With the extensive set of intermediate baryon-meson
states used, a reasonable correspondence is found between model masses and the
bare masses required to fit the masses of the states extracted from data
analyses.

leptons), by explaining quark and lepton flavors, flavor doublets and families.
Moreover, these new fermion coordinates lead to quantitative constraints on
neutrino mixtures that are found to be in good agreement with current
experimental observations.

A, 66 (2002) 022113","10.1103/PhysRevA.66.022113",,"quant-ph",,"  We suggest a quantum measurement model in an ion trap which specifies the
probability distribution of two, distinct internal ground states of a trapped
four-level ion. The external degrees of motion of the four-level ion constitute
the meter which, in turn, is coupled to the environment by engineered
reservoirs. In a previous publication, a similar measurement model was employed
to test decoherence effects on quantum nonlocality in phase space on the basis
of coincidence measurements of the entangled system-meter scheme. Here, we
study the effects of decoherence on the entanglement of formation characterized
by the concurrence. The concurrence of the system enables to find the maximum
possible violation of the Bell inequality. Surprisingly, this model gives
illustrative insights into the question to what extend the Bell inequality can
be considered as a measure of entanglement.

one-photon running-wave field states. In addition to linear optical elements,
Kerr nonlinearity is also employed so as to achieve a 100% probability of
success in the ideal case. A comprehensive phenomenological treatment of errors
in the domain of running-wave physics, for linear and nonlinear optical
elements, is also given, making it possible to calculate the fidelity of the
teleportation process. A strategy for carrying out the Bell-type measurement
which is able to probe the absorption of photons in the optical elements is
adopted. Such strategy, combined with usually small damping constants
characterizing the optical devices, results in a high fidelity for the
teleportation process. The feasibility of the proposed scheme relies on the
fact that the Kerr nonlinearity it demands can be achieved through the recently
reported ultraslow light propagation in cold atomic media [Phys. Rev. Lett. 84,
1419 (2000); Phys. Rev. A 65, 033833 (2002)].
