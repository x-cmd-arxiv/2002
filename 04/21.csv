Comptonization of the cosmic microwave background in clusters of galaxies. We
have calculated the additional intensity change due to various possible
populations of energetic electrons that have been proposed in order to account
for measurements of intracluster radio, nonthermal X-ray and (possibly also)
EUV emission. Our properly normalized estimates of (the highly model dependent
value of) the predicted intensity change due to these electrons is well below
$\sim 6%$ and $\sim 35%$ of the usual Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect due to electrons
in the hot gas in Coma and A2199, respectively. These levels constitute high
upper limits since they are based on energetic electron populations whose
energy densities are {\it comparable} to those of the thermal gas. The main
impact of nonthermal Comptonization is a shift of the crossover frequency
(where the thermal effect vanishes) to higher values. Such a shift would have
important consequences for our ability to measure cluster peculiar velocities
from the kinematic component of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.

a stochastic mass loss process, i.e., variation of mass loss rate with time and
location on the giant's surface, and in relatively strong X-ray emission. The

probability 1-p, simulates an external energy flux. These two mechanisms are
natural generalizations of Glauber's single-spin flipping mechanism and
Kawasaki's spin-pair exchange mechanism respectively. On the one hand, the new
mechanism is in principle applicable to arbitrary systems, while on the other
hand, our formulation is able to contain a mechanism that just directly
combines single-spin flipping and spin-pair exchange in their original form.
Compared with the conventional mechanism, the new mechanism does not assume the
simplified version and leads to greater influence of temperature. The fact,
order for lower temperature and disorder for higher temperature, will be
universally true. In order to exemplify this difference, we applied the
mechanism to 1D Ising model and obtained analytical results. We also applied
this mechanism to kinetic Gaussian model and found that, above the critical
point there will be only paramagnetic phase, while below the critical point,
the self-organization as a result of the energy flux will lead the system to an
interesting heterophase, instead of the initially guessed antiferromagnetic
phase. We studied this process in details.

Proceedings of AAAI-2002 (in press)",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI",,"  Global mobile robot localization is the problem of determining a robot's pose
in an environment, using sensor data, when the starting position is unknown. A
family of probabilistic algorithms known as Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) is
currently among the most popular methods for solving this problem. MCL
algorithms represent a robot's belief by a set of weighted samples, which
approximate the posterior probability of where the robot is located by using a
Bayesian formulation of the localization problem. This article presents an
extension to the MCL algorithm, which addresses its problems when localizing in
highly symmetrical environments; a situation where MCL is often unable to
correctly track equally probable poses for the robot. The problem arises from
the fact that sample sets in MCL often become impoverished, when samples are
generated according to their posterior likelihood. Our approach incorporates
the idea of clusters of samples and modifies the proposal distribution
considering the probability mass of those clusters. Experimental results are
presented that show that this new extension to the MCL algorithm successfully
localizes in symmetric environments where ordinary MCL often fails.
