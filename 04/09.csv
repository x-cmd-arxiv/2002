including 18 of 23 Pleiades members. Five candidate Pleiades members have also
been detected, confirming their cluster membership. Fifty-seven sources have no
optical or near-infrared counterparts to limiting magnitudes V=22.5 and J=14.5.
The unidentified X-ray sources are probably background AGN and not stars. The
Chandra field of view contains seven intermediate mass cluster members. Five of

high X-ray luminosity and soft X-ray spectra. HII 1284 has X-ray properties
comparable to non-flaring K-type stars. Since all five stars are visual or
spectroscopic binaries with X-ray properties similar to F-G stars, the
late-type binary companions are probably producing the observed coronal X-ray
emission. Strengthening this conclusion is the nondetection by Chandra of two A
stars, HII 1362 (A7, no known companion) and HII 1375 (A0 + A SB) with X-ray
luminosity upper limits 27-54 times smaller than HII 980 and HII 956, the B6-A7
stars with cooler companions. Despite the low number statistics, the Chandra
data appear to confirm the expectation that late-B and A stars are not strong
intrinsic X-ray sources. The ACIS spectra and hardness ratios suggest a gradual
increase in coronal temperature with decreasing mass from F4 to K. M stars
appear to have somewhat cooler coronae than active K stars.

galactic black hole candidates accreting at a rate well below the Eddington
value. Interestingly that during this phase the source spectrum was very
similar to the Cygnus X-1 spectrum in the low state inspite of more than order

spiral pattern which, for the northern arm, can be traced to the nucleus.
Comparison of the OVRO and archival HST data with dynamical models of gas flow
in the inner kiloparsec of single- and double-barred galaxies shows that the
observed global properties of the molecular gas are in agreement with models
for the gas flow in a strong, large-scale bar, and the two-arm spiral structure
seen in CO in the inner kiloparsec can already be explained by a density wave
initiated by the potential of that bar. Only a weak correlation between the
molecular gas distribution and the extinction seen in the HST V-H map is found
in the inner 400 pc of NGC4303: The innermost part of one arm of the nuclear CO
spiral correlates with a weak dust filament in the color map, while the overall
dust distribution follows a ring or single-arm spiral pattern well correlated
with the UV continuum. This complicated nuclear geometry of the stellar and
gaseous components allows for two scenarios: (A) A self-gravitating m=1 mode is
present forming the spiral structure seen in the UV continuum. In this case the
gas kinematics would be unaffected by the small (~ 4'') inner bar. (B) The UV
continuum traces a complete ring which is heavily extincted north of the
nucleus. Such a ring forms in hydrodynamic models of double bars, but the

keV) and by ASM (1.5-12 keV) until 2002 June, including 1200 days of
simultaneous data. We find a number of correlations between fluxes and
hardnesses in different energy bands. In the hard state, the variability can be
explained by softening the overall spectrum with a pivot at 50 keV and another,
independent variability pattern where the spectral shape does not change when
the luminosity changes. In the soft state, the variability is caused by a
variable hard tail of a constant shape superimposed on a constant soft
component. These variability patterns are in agreement with the
energy-dependent rms variability in the two states. We also study in detail
recent soft states in 2000-02. The last of them has lasted so far for >200
days. Their spectra are harder in the 1.5-5 keV band but similar or in the 3-12
keV band than those of the 1996 soft state whereas the rms variability is
stronger in all the ASM bands. On the other hand, the 1994 soft state
transition observed by BATSE appears very similar to the 1996 one. We interpret
the variability patterns by theoretical Comptonization models. In the hard
state, the variability appears to be driven mostly by changing flux in seed
photons Comptonized in a hot thermal plasma cloud with an approximately
constant power supply. In the soft state, the variability is consistent with
flares of hybrid, thermal/nonthermal, plasma with variable power above a stable
cold disk. The spectral and timing differences between the 1996 and 2000-02
soft states are explained by a decrease of the color disk temperature. Also,
based on broad-band pointed observations, we find the intrinsic bolometric
luminosity increases by a factor of 3-4 from the hard state to the soft one.

modulus of the velocity dispersion is $$p(v) \propto v^2

value of the average cloud collision elasticity < \epsilon > as \beta =

known, the specific kinetic energy dissipated by collisions is found to be
\propto \sigma^2 \ln (2 / \beta)/(\beta-0.947); in steady state, this is equal
to the energy input from SNe. We predict that in a multiphase, low metallicity

degree of saturation of these masers must be less than approximately one-third,
from which it follows that the beaming angles are less than about 10^{-4} ster

galaxy disks were determined using three-dimensional numerical simulations in

When the ratio of the midplane gas density to the midplane total density is
small, an expanding shell reaches the disk scale height and vents to the halo
before it collapses. When the Toomre instability parameter Q, or a similar
shear parameter, Q_A, are large, Coriolis forces and shear stall or reverse the
collapse before the shell accumulates enough mass to be unstable. With large
values of C=c_sh/(GL)^0.2, for rms velocity dispersion c_sh in the swept-up
matter and shell-driving luminosity L, the pressure in the accumulated gas is
too large to allow collapse during the expansion time. Considering ~5000 models
covering a wide range of parameter space, the common properties of shell
collapse as a mechanism for triggered star formation are: (1) the time scale is
4*sqrt(C/2 pi G rho) for ambient midplane density rho, (2) the total fragment
mass is ~2x10^7 Msun, of which only a small fraction is likely to be molecular,
(3) the triggering radius is ~2 times the scale height, and the triggering
probability is ~0.5 for large OB associations. Star formation triggered by

fluctuations in the interstellar medium that cause the radiation to travel
along paths of different lengths. The Gaussian theory of fluctuations predicts
that the pulse temporal broadening should scale with the wavelength as
lambda^4, and with the dispersion measure (corresponding to distance to the
pulsar) as DM^2. For large dispersion measure, DM > 20 pc/cm^3, the observed
scaling is lambda^4 DM^4, contradicting the conventional theory. Although the
problem has existed for 30 years, there has been no resolution to this paradox.
  We suggest that scintillations for distant pulsars are caused by
non-Gaussian, spatially intermittent density fluctuations with a power-like
probability distribution. This probability distribution does not have a second
moment in a large range of density fluctuations, and therefore the previously
applied conventional Fokker-Planck theory does not hold. Instead, we propose to
apply the theory of Levy distributions (so-called Levy flights). Using the
scaling analysis (confirmed by numerical simulations of ray propagation) we

particular using the skewness measure, have been attempted before, but the
photon collection area of RXTE allows us to present results of much greater
statistical significance. The results for the two objects are qualitatively
similar, reinforcing the idea that the same basic mechanisms are at work in
both. We find a significantly positive skewness for variability timescales less
than $\sim 1 $ second, and a {\it negative} skewness for timescale $1- 5 $ sec.
Such a skewness pattern cannot be reproduced by the simplest shot variability
models where individual shots have a fixed profile and intensity and are
uncorrelated in time. Further evidence against simple shot models comes from
the significant detection of a non-zero bicoherence for Fourier periods $\sim
0.1-10$ sec, implying that significant coupling does exist between variations
on these timescales. We discuss how current popular models for variability in
black hole systems can be modified to match these observations. Using simulated
light curves, we suggest that the most likely way to reproduce this observed
behavior is to have the variability come in groups of many shots, with the
number of shots per unit time fitting an envelope function which has a rapid
rise and slow decay, while the individual shots have a slow rise and a rapid
decay. Invoking a finite energy reservoir that is depleted by each shot is a
natural way of producing the required shot correlations.

57+-22 percent. The disc light distributions are further investigated for the
presence of radial truncations. We find that the radial light distributions of

blackbody. No unequivocal evidence of spectral line or edge features has been
found, arguing against metal-dominated models. The data contain no evidence for

vary by factors 2-3 and that the iron line intensity appears to track these
changes well, i.e., the inferred equivalent width of the line remains constant
to within the errors. We also find no significant changes in the seed
(blackbody) photon temperature, while the properties of the Comptonising corona
clearly do vary, with the spectral hardness and flux generally being
correlated. The corona therefore seems to be the overall driver for the rapid
timescale variability observed in the soft and transition states. These results
are consistent with the Fourier resolved spectroscopy results of Gilfanov et
al. (2000) that indicate the iron line shows rapid flux variations while the
blackbody component does not and suggest that the iron line flux in fact tracks
continuum changes down to very short timescales. We extend this work by showing
that not only the variability amplitudes, but also the {\it phases} of the iron
line and continuum components are identical. We note that the short timescale
variability properties of the soft and transition states are actually not very
different from those of the hard state, suggesting that the corona is the main
cause of rapid variability in that state too, and hence that the mechanism
responsible for the corona is similar in all three states.

interpretation can be performed without loss of precision by systematically
refining abstract domains. The idea is to include semantic structures into
abstract domains in such a way that the refined abstract domain becomes rich
enough to allow approximate bottom-up and top-down semantics to agree. These
domains are known as condensing abstract domains. Substantially, an abstract
domain is condensing if goal-driven and goal-independent analyses agree, namely
no loss of precision is introduced by approximating queries in a
goal-independent analysis. We prove that condensation is an abstract domain
property and that the problem of making an abstract domain condensing boils
down to the problem of making the domain complete with respect to unification.
In a general abstract interpretation setting we show that when concrete domains
and operations give rise to quantales, i.e. models of propositional linear
logic, objects in a complete refined abstract domain can be explicitly
characterized by linear logic-based formulations. This is the case for abstract
domains for logic program analysis approximating computed answer substitutions
where unification plays the role of multiplicative conjunction in a quantale of
idempotent substitutions. Condensing abstract domains can therefore be
systematically derived by minimally extending any, generally non-condensing
domain, by a simple domain refinement operator.

(MSGCs) with diamond like coated (DLC) glass wafers and gas electron
multipliers (GEMs). The main problems in the development phase were gas
discharges in intense hadron beams and aging in a high radiation dose
environment. The observation of gas discharges which damage the electrode
structure of the MSGC led to the addition of the GEM as a first amplification
step. Spurious sparking at the GEM cannot be avoided completely. It does not
affect the GEM itself but can produce secondary damage of the MSGC if the
electric field between the GEM and the MSGC is above a threshold depending on
operation conditions. We observed that aging does not only depend on the dose
but also on the spot size of the irradiated area. Ar-DME mixtures had to be
abandoned whereas a mixture of 70% Ar and 30% CO2 showed no serious aging
effects up to about 40 mC/cm deposited charge on the anodes. X-ray measurements
indicate that the DLC of the MSGC is deteriorated by the gas amplification
process. As a consequence, long term gain variations are expected. The Inner

include possible differences in the fluxes of the muon and tau neutrinos

flux differences can manifest themselves in the effects of the Earth matter on
the observed nu_e (antinu_e) signal if: (i) the neutrino mass hierarchy is
normal (inverted); (ii) the solution of the solar neutrino problem is in the
LMA region; (iii) the mixing U_{e3} is relatively large: |U_{e3}|>10^{-3}. We
find that for differences in the nu_mu - nu_tau (antinu_mu - antinu_tau)
average energies and/or integrated luminosities < 20 %, the relative deviation
of the observed nu_e (antinu_e) energy spectrum at E > 50 MeV from that in the

would allow one to test the predictions of the nu_mu, nu_tau, antinu_mu,
antinu_tau fluxes from supernova models and therefore give an important insight
into the properties of matter at extreme conditions. It should be taken into

We compare calculations in this dipole approach with E772 data and with

suitable to describe nuclear effects, since it allows one to apply Glauber
multiple scattering theory. We go beyond the Glauber eikonal approximation by

least one brane-world model can offer plausible interpretations for both
Young's double-slit experiment, and the experiments that fit less neatly with
it. The basic assumption is that particles can interact at a distance through
the vibrations induced by their motion on the brane. The qualitative analysis
of this mechanism suggests that fringe visibility in single photon interference
depends on the energy levels and the interval between interacting particles. A
double-slit experiment, performed with coherent single red photons should
reveal the disappearance of interference when the time delay between individual
particles is increased over 2.18 seconds. In the case of infrared photons with
the frequency of $9\cdot 10^{13}$ Hz, interference must vanish already at the

essentially only the Brownian motion and the Poisson process possess the
chaotic representation property (CRP). Thus, a natural question appears: What
is an appropriate analog of the CRP in the case of a general L\'evy process. At
least three approaches are possible here. The first one, due to
  It\^o, uses the CRP of the Brownian motion and the Poisson process, as well
as the representation of a L\'evy process through those processes. The second
approach, due to Nualart and Schoutens, consists in representing any
square-integrable random variable as a sum of multiple stochastic integrals
constructed with respect to a family of orthogonalized centered power jumps
processes. The third approach, never applied before to the L\'evy processes,
uses the idea of orthogonalization of polynomials with respect to a probability
measure defined on the dual of a nuclear space. The main aims of the present
paper are to develop the three approaches in the case of a general
($\R$-valued) L\'evy process on a Riemannian manifold and (what is more
important) to understand a relationship between these approaches. We apply the
obtained results to the gamma, Pascal, and Meixner processes, in which case the
analysis related to the orthogonalized polynomials becomes essentially simpler
and richer than in the general case.

arises from a stochastic partial differential equation with a multiplicative
noise term. This process has some unusual properties. We work with the heat
equation with a random potential: u_t=Delta u+kuF. Here k>0 is a small number,
and x lies in d-dimensional Euclidean space with d>2. F is a Gaussian noise
which is uncorrelated in time, and whose spatial covariance equals |x-y|^(-2).
The exponent 2 is critical in the following sense. For exponents less than 2,
the equation has function-valued solutions, and for exponents higher than 2, we
do not expect solutions to exist. This model is closely related to the
parabolic Anderson model; we expect solutions to be small, except for a
collection of high peaks. This phenomenon is called intermittency, and is
reflected in the singular nature of our process. Solutions exist as singular
measures, under suitable assumptions on the initial conditions and for
sufficiently small k. We investigate various properties of the solutions, such
as dimension of the support and long-time behavior. As opposed to the
super-Brownian motion, which satisfies a similar equation, our process does not
have compact support, nor does it die out in finite time. We use such tools as
scaling, self-duality and moment formulae.

Peripheric chains of extended twists are constructed for U(sl(N)) in order to

proved that the peripheric chains can be enlarged with additional Reshetikhin
and Jordanian factors. This provides the possibility to construct new solutions
to Drinfeld equations and, thus, to quantize new sets of Lie-Poisson
structures. When the Jordanian additional factors are used the carrier algebras
of the enlarged peripheric chains are transformed into algebras of motion of
the form G_{JB}^{P}={G}_{H}\vdash {G}_{P}. The factor algebra G_{H} is a direct
sum of Borel and contracted Borel subalgebras of lower dimensions. The
corresponding omega--form is a coboundary. The enlarged peripheric chains

indicates that the pion spectrum in chemically frozen hydrodynamics is
significantly cooler than in the hydro+cascade model. This difference is
reflected in $v_{2}(p_{T})$. We extract the freezeout hadron density in RQMD

isothermal (NVT) molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation of systems with mixed
hard-core/continuous potentials. The methods are generated by combining
real-time Nose' thermostats with our previously developed Collision Verlet
algorithm [Mol. Phys. 98, 309 (1999)] for constant energy MD simulation of such
systems. In all we present 5 methods, one based on the Nose'-Hoover [Phys. Rev.
A 31, 1695 (1985)] equations of motion and four based on the Nose'-Poincare'
[J.Comp.Phys., 151 114 (1999)] real-time formulation of Nose' dynamics. The
methods are tested using a system of hard spheres with attractive tails and all
correctly reproduce a canonical distribution of instantaneous temperature. The
Nose'-Hoover based method and two of the Nose'-Poincare' methods are shown to
have good energy conservation in long simulations.

adiabatic quantum search of a data base of $N$ items. In particular we examine
the effects on the computation time of adding energy to the system. We find
that by increasing the lowest eigenvalue of the time dependent Hamiltonian {\it
temporarily} to a maximum of $\propto \sqrt{N}$, it is possible to do the
calculation in constant time. This leads us to derive the general theorem which
provides the adiabatic analogue of the $\sqrt{N}$ bound of conventional quantum
searches. The result suggests that the action associated with the oracle term
in the time dependent Hamiltonian is a direct measure of the resources required
by the adiabatic quantum search.
