allowing properly for the conservation of angular momentum. We study
analytically the case of slowly rotating isothermal spheres by expanding the
solutions of the Boltzmann-Poisson equation in a series of Legendre
polynomials, adapting the procedure introduced by Chandrasekhar (1933) for
distorted polytropes. We show how the classical spiral of Lynden-Bell & Wood
(1967) in the temperature-energy plane is deformed by rotation. We find that
gravitational instability occurs sooner in the microcanonical ensemble and
later in the canonical ensemble. According to standard turning point arguments,
the onset of the collapse coincides with the minimum energy or minimum
temperature state in the series of equilibria. Interestingly, it happens to be
close to the point of maximum flattening. We determine analytically the
generalization of the singular isothermal solution to the case of a slowly
rotating configuration. We also consider slowly rotating configurations of the
self-gravitating Fermi gas at non zero temperature.

The observational limit can be explained by cooling of a superfluid NS with the
core composed of neutrons, protons and electrons, where direct Urca process is
forbidden. However, combined with the data on the surface temperatures of other
isolated NSs, it gives evidence (emphasized by Slane et al.) that direct Urca

result in a marginal improvement to the goodness of the fit. Two of the
observations are fit better by an almost purely non-thermal Comptonization
model with $\Gamma_{inj}$ of $\sim$ 3.2 for the electrons and the other
parameters essentially the same as for the thermal model, while the third
observation is also consistent with this model. Observations that could break
this degeneracy are discussed. We also demonstrate that the low reflection
parameter (i.e. $R/2\pi<1$) is due to a lack of strong curvature in the 30-50
keV range of the spectrum and not due to ionization effects. The spectrum
changes very little over the three weeks of the observations, in accordance
with a three week correlation timescale found in the All Sky Monitor data. We
show that for a purely thermal corona, the radius of the corona must be between
$3\times 10^6$ and $1.5\times 10^{10}$ cm, while the radius of a hybrid corona

temporal resolution. Venus is clearly detected as a half-lit crescent, with
considerable brightening on the sunward limb. The morphology agrees well with
that expected from fluorescent scattering of solar X-rays in the planetary
atmosphere. The radiation is observed at discrete energies, mainly at the
O-K_alpha energy of 0.53 keV. Fluorescent radiation is also detected from
C-K_alpha at 0.28 keV and, marginally, from N-K_alpha at 0.40 keV. An
additional emission line is indicated at 0.29 keV, which might be the signature
of the C 1s --> pi* transition in CO_2 and CO. Evidence for temporal
variability of the X-ray flux was found at the 2.6 sigma level, with
fluctuations by factors of a few times indicated on time scales of minutes. All
these findings are fully consistent with fluorescent scattering of solar
X-rays. No other source of X-ray emission was detected, in particular none from
charge exchange interactions between highly charged heavy solar wind ions and
atmospheric neutrals, the dominant process for the X-ray emission of comets.
This is in agreement with the sensitivity of the observation.

  model","15 pages. Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20020547",,"astro-ph",,"  The formation and evolution of galactic disks are complex phenomena, where
gas and star dynamics are coupled through star formation and the related
feedback. The physical processes are so numerous and intricate that numerical
models focus, in general, on one or a few of them only. We propose here a
numerical model with particular attention to the multiphase nature of the
interstellar medium; we consider a warm gas phase (> 10^4 K), treated as a
continuous fluid by an SPH algorithm, and a cold gas phase (down to 10K),
fragmented in clouds, treated by a low-dissipation sticky particles component.
The two gas phases do not have the same dynamics, nor the same spatial
distribution. In addition to gravity, they are coupled through mass exchanges
due to heating/cooling processes, and supernovae feedback. Stars form out of
the cold phase, and re-inject mass to the warm phase through SN explosions and
stellar winds. The baryons are embedded in a live cold dark matter component.
  Baryonic disks, initially composed of pure gas, encounter violent
instabilities, and a rapid phase of star formation, that slows down
exponentially. Stars form in big clumps, that accumulate in the center to build
a bulge. Exponential metallicity gradients are obtained. External infall of gas
should be included to maintain a star formation rate in the disk comparable to
what is observed in present disk galaxies.

the neutral atomic gas emission in N1313 and N6946 do not significantly differ
from what Malhotra etal (2001) found by modelling the integrated emission of a
sample of 60 normal galaxies,although there are evidences for a beam averaged
contribution of a less active component inside NGC6946 higher than its
contribution in the integrated emission of normal galaxies. CO and [CII] in
N6946 are well correlated with a mean [CII]/CO ratio similar to that of the
normal galaxies sample. In N1313 the [CII]/CO seems to systematically increase
from the North to the south, along the S-shaped spiral arm, indicating much
more inhomogeneous conditions than in N6946. HI and [CII] in N6946 are
completely de-correlated, probably because they arise from different gas
components. In N1313 we successfully detect two distinct gas components: a
cirrus-like component where HI and [CII] are weakly correlated as observed in
our Galaxy, and a component associated with dense PDRs completely de-correlated
from HI as observed in N6946.Finally, we find that the HI residing in dense
PDRs and presumably recently photo-dissociated, constitutes a few % of the
total HI. In turn, this dense gas component produces most of the [CII] emission
emitted by the atomic neutral medium.

the random-phase approximation (RPA) for temperature $T=0 $. This self energy
does not have the divergence with the logarithm of the area, which is known to

function of the interacting system is also finite. The non-vanishing of the
Green's function for infinite area is due to a dynamical creation of the phase
factors linking the created and annihilated particles with the particles in the
ground state. The absence of these phase factors is the reason for the
vanishing of the Green's function in the Coulomb gauge.

equilibrium state of the superconductor is established. This relaxation is not
due to thermally activated flux creep but to the ""walking"" motion of vortices
in the two-dimensional critical state of the strip with in-plane ac field. Our
theory explains the shaking effect that was used for detecting phase
transitions of the vortex lattice in superconductors with pinning. Some recent
experiments on this subject are discussed.

the Clausius relation in a quasi-static experiment, we obtain the standard
result of thermodynamic relation that the physical temperature of the

that the presence of negative specific heat leads to the thermodynamic
instability. In addition to the gravothermal instability discovered previously,
the specific heat shows the curious divergent behavior at the polytrope index
$n>3$, suggesting another type of thermodynamic instability. Evaluating the
second variation of free energy, we find that the marginal stability condition
indicated from the specific heat can be exactly recovered from the second
variation of free energy. Thus, the stellar polytropic system is consistently
characterized by the non-extensive thermostatistics as a plausible thermal

of the universe generically induces small oscillations in the stabilized radius
of extra dimensions (the radion field). The frequency of these oscillations is
proportional to the mass of the radion and can have interesting cosmological
consequences. For very low radion masses $m_b$ ($m_b\sim10-100
H_0\simeq10^{-32} eV$) these low frequency oscillations lead to oscillations in
the expansion rate of the universe. The occurrence of acceleration periods
could naturally lead to a resolution of the coincidence problem, without need
of dark energy. Even though this scenario for low radion mass is consistent
with several observational tests it has difficulty to meet fifth force
constraints. If viewed as an effective Brans-Dicke theory it predicts
$\omega=-1+\frac{1}{D}$ ($D$ is the number of extra dimensions), while
experiments on scales larger than $1mm$ imply $\omega>2500$. By deriving the
generalized Newtonian potential corresponding to a massive toroidally compact
radion we demonstrate that Newtonian gravity is modified only on scales smaller
than $m_b^{-1}$. Thus, these constraints do not apply for $m_b>10^{-3} eV$
(high frequency oscillations) corresponding to scales less than the current
experiments ($0.3mm$). Even though these high frequency oscillations can not
resolve the coincidence problem they provide a natural mechanism for dark
matter generation. This type of dark matter has many similarities with the
axion.

all the field sectors, discrete parts outside the continuum as well as the

atom coupled to a light field. The evolution of this system is governed by a
master equation. The irreversible components of this master equation describe
the spontaneous emission of photons from the atom. For many applications, it is
necessary to minimize the effect of this irreversible evolution. This can be
achieved by having a far detuned light field. The drawback of this regime is
that making the detuning very large makes the timestep required to solve the
master equation very small, much smaller than the timescale of any significant
evolution. This makes the problem very numerically intensive. For this reason,
approximations are used to simulate the master equation which are more
numerically tractable to solve. This paper analyses four approximations: The
standard adiabatic approximation; a more sophisticated adiabatic approximation
(not used before); a secular approximation; and a fully quantum dressed-state
approximation. The advantages and disadvantages of each are investigated with
respect to accuracy, complexity and the resources required to simulate. In a
parameter regime of particular experimental interest, only the sophisticated
adiabatic and dressed-state approximations agree well with the exact evolution.
