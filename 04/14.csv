period of 515.0592(2) s, and a mean full amplitude of 0.11 mag. These

a variable SSC component) involving substantial pre-acceleration of electrons

H-rich central stars, is found around the vast majority of cool Wolf-Rayet
central stars. This correlation between Wolf-Rayet characteristics and double
dust chemistry points to a common mechanism. Within the binary evolution
framework established by Soker, two scenarios are proposed, responsible for the
majority (80-85%) and minority (15-20%) of Wolf-Rayet central stars. In the
first scenario, proposed here for the first time, a low mass main sequence
star, brown dwarf or planet spirals into the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star
inducing extra mixing, hence a chemistry change, and terminating the AGB
evolution. In the second scenario, previously proposed, a close binary
companion is responsible for the formation of a disk around either the binary
or the companion. This long-lived disk harbors the O-rich dust.

upper bound for the parameter of the weak-coupling approximation. Namely, when
this bound is exceeded, the cumulant expansion used for the average over the
Higgs field breaks down. The finite-temperature deconfining phase transition
with the account for the same Higgs-mediated interaction of monopoles is
further analysed. It is demonstrated that in the general case, accounting for
this interaction leads to the existence of two distinct phase transitions
separated by the temperature region where W-bosons exist in both, molecular and
plasma, phases. The dependence of possible ranges of the critical temperatures
corresponding to these phase transitions on the parameters of the
Georgi-Glashow model is discussed. The difference in the RG behaviour of the
fugacity of W-bosons from the respective behaviour of this quantity in the
compact-QED limit of the model is finally pointed out.

absence of space-time supersymmetry, are treated in this framework as a
necessary ingredient to ensure cosmological flow. The model involves D3 brane
worlds, whose initial quantum fluctuations induce the non criticality. I argue
that this model is compatible with the current astrophysical observations
pointing towards acceleration of the Universe. A crucial r\^ole for the correct
``phenomenology'' of the model, in particular the order-one value of the
deceleration parameter, is played by the relative magnitude of the flux of the
five form of the type-0 string as compared to the size of the volume of five of
the extra dimensions, transverse to the direction of the flux-field.

constraints upon its stable systoles. Given a compact Riemannian manifold

Briefly, if h\in H_k(X,R) then the stable norm of h is the infimum of the
Riemannian k-volumes of real cycles representing h. The stable k-systole is the
minimum of the stable norm over nonzero elements in the lattice of integral
classes in H_k(X,R). Relying on results from the geometry of numbers due to W.
Banaszczyk, and extending work by M. Gromov and J. Hebda, we prove
metric-independent inequalities for products of stable systoles, where the

neighborhood of suitable k-dimensional submanifolds of X. We employ calibration
by differential forms supported in such neighborhoods, to provide lower bounds
for the (n-k)-systoles. Meanwhile, the k-systoles are controlled from below by
the monotonicity formula combined with the bounded geometry of the construction
in a neighborhood of suitable (n-k+1)-dimensional submanifolds, in spite of the
vanishing of the global injectivity radius. The construction is geometric, with
the algebraic topology ingredient reduced to Poincare duality and Thom's
theorem on representing multiples of homology classes by submanifolds. The
present result is different from the proof, in collaboration with A. Suciu, and
relying on rational homotopy theory, of the k-systolic freedom of X. Our
results concerning systolic freedom contrast with the existence of stable
systolic inequalities, studied in joint work with V. Bangert.

theory of quantum irreversibility and dissipation in driven mesoscopic devices
(eg in the context of quantum computation). For extremely slow wall velocity
$V$ the spreading mechanism is dominated by transitions between neighboring
levels, while for larger (non-adiabatic) velocities the spreading mechanism has
both perturbative and non-perturbative features. We present, for the first

procedure is developed for the determination of the various $V$ regimes. The

first-order perturbative field theory. In three dimension, magnitude of triad
interactions is large for nonlocal triads, and small for local triads. However,
the shell-to-shell energy transfer rate is found to be local and forward. This
result is due to the fact that the nonlocal triads occupy much less Fourier
space volume than the local ones. The analytical results on three-dimensional
shell-to-shell energy transfer match with their numerical counterparts. In
two-dimensional turbulence, the energy transfer rates to the near-by shells are
forward, but to the distant shells are backward; the cumulative effect is an
inverse cascade of energy.

isomers (or spin modifications) of molecules. The main reason is the lack of
practical enrichment techniques. Recently a few enrichment methods were
developed, which opened up new possibilities in the field. These methods are
briefly reviewed. Substantial progress in the field has been made by the
introduction of Light-Induced Drift as a gas-phase separation tool. This is
illustrated by extensive data on CH3F, which reveal that the gas-phase
ortho-para conversion is governed by intramolecular mixing of the nuclear spin
states. The role of ``direct'' ortho-para transitions is shown to be small.
Various aspects of the conversion were investigated in detail: pressure and
collision partner dependence, isotope effect, temperature dependence. The most
decisive information on the spin conversion mechanism is derived from the
observation of level-crossing resonances in an electric field and the Quantum
Zeno effect induced by collisions.
