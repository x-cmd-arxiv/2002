  Transition Nucleus in NGC 4569","24 pages, 8 figures, to be published in The Astronomical Journal",,"10.1086/341376",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a comprehensive study to determine if the LINER/H II region
transition spectrum in NGC 4569 can be generated solely by photoionization by
the nuclear starburst. A review of the multiwavelength data from the literature
reveals no additional sources that contribute to the ionization. We find that
the young starburst dominating the UV emission is distinct from the nuclear
population of A supergiants identified in the optical spectrum by Keel (1996).
Spectral synthesis analysis provides constraints on the physical nature of the
starburst, revealing a 5-6 Myr, approximately instantaneous starburst with
subsolar metallicity. These results are used to model the spectral energy
distribution of the ionizing continuum. Luminosity constraints place limits on
the steepness of the extinction curve for the young starburst. The Savage &
Mathis (1979) curve satisfies all luminosity constraints and the derived
reddening is similar to the emission line reddening. These results imply
extreme conditions in the nuclear starburst, with ~5x10^4 O and B stars
compacted in the inner 9"" x 13"" region of the nucleus. Using photoionization
analysis and employing all observational constraints on the emission line gas,
we find very specific conditions are required if the spectrum is generated
solely by stellar photoionization. At least two spatially distinct components
are required - a compact region with strong O III emission and an extended, low
density component emitting most of the S II flux. A high density component is
also needed to generate the O I flux. Additionally, a limited contribution from
Wolf-Rayet stars to the ionizing SED is necessary, consistent with the results
of Barth & Shields (2000). We present a physical interpretation for the
multi-component emission line gas.

function of initial ellipsoid axis ratios. We then perform a series of $N$-body
numerical simulations and contrast their evolution with the fluid solutions. We
verify an analytic relation between collapse factor ${\cal C}$ and particle
number $N$ in spherical symmetry, such that ${\cal C} \propto N^{1/3}$. We
sought a similar relation for axisymmetric configurations, and found an
empirical scaling relation such that ${\cal C} \propto N^{1/6}$ in these cases.
We then show that when mass distributions do not respect spherical- or
axial-symmetry, the ensuing gravitational collapse deepens with increasing
particle number $N$ but only slowly: 86% of triaxial configurations may
collapse by a factor of no more than 40 as $N\to\infty$. For $N\approx 10^5$
and larger, violent relaxation develops fully under the Lin-Mestel-Shu
instability such that numerical $N$-body solutions now resolve the different
initial morphologies adequately.

imaged in F255W. These galaxies were selected to be detectable with WFPC2 in
one orbit, and cover a wide range of Hubble types and inclinations. The mid-UV
spans the gap between our groundbased optical/NIR images and far-UV images
available from the Astro/UIT missions. Our first qualitative results are:
  (1) Early-type galaxies show a significant decrease in surface brightness
going from the red to the mid-UV, and in some cases the presence of dust lanes.
Some galaxies would be classified different when viewed in the mid-UV, some
become dominated by a blue nuclear feature or point source.
  (2) Half of the mid-type spiral and star-forming galaxies appear as a later
morphological type in the mid-UV, as Astro/UIT also found in the far-UV. Some-
times these differences are dramatic. The mid-UV images show a considerable
range in the scale and surface brightness of individual star-forming regions.
Almost all mid-type spirals have their small bulges bi-sected by a dust-lane.
  (3) Most of the heterogeneous subset of late-type, irregular, peculiar, and
merging galaxies display F300W morphologies that are similar to those seen in
F814W, but with differences due to recognizable dust features absorbing the
bluer light, and due to UV-bright hot stars, star-clusters, and star-forming
ridges.
  In the rest-frame mid-UV, early- to mid-type galaxies are more likely to be
misclassified as later types than vice versa. This morphological K-correction
explains only part of the excess faint blue galaxies seen in deep HST fields.

chemical evolution on stellar evolution and photometric properties. Comparisons
between the chemical evolution models and the observed abundance patterns
reveal that the star formation rates were very low (1-5% of that of the solar
neighbourhood disc) and that the initial star formation continued for a long
duration (> 3.9-6.5 Gyr) in these dSphs. This star formation history can
reproduce morphologies of the observed CMDs, such as narrow red giant branches
and red horizontal branches. Hence, both of the abundance patterns and the
morphologies of the CMDs can be explained by the star formation histories
characterised by the low star formation rate and the long duration of the star
formation period. Because of the low star formation rates, plenty of gas
remains at the final epoch of star formation. We suggest that gas stripping by
the Galaxy results in termination of star formation in the dSphs.

dust forms easily at the condensation temperature, T_cond, and the dust can be
in detailed balance with the ambient gas so long as it remains smaller than the
critical radius, r_cr. However, dust will grow larger and segregate from the
gas when it will be larger than r_cr somewhere at the lower temperature, which
we refer to as the critical temperature, T_cr. Then, the large dust grains will
precipitate below the photosphere and only the small dust grains in the region
of T_cr < T < T_cond can be sustained in the photosphere. Thus a dust cloud is
formed. Incorporating the dust cloud, non-grey model photo- spheres in
radiative-convective equilibrium are extended to T_eff as low as 800K. Observed

equilibrium temperature of the plasma together with the escaping spectrum. The
spectrum depends mainly on the amount of cold clouds filling the hot phase. The
clouds covering factor is constrained to be low in order to produce spectra
similar to those observed in Seyfert galaxies and X-ray binaries, implying that
an external reflector is required in order to reproduce the full range of
observed reflection amplitudes. We also derive analytical estimates for the
X-ray spectral slope and reflection amplitude using an escape probability
formalism.

external shock strongly amplifies the magnetic field and that this field
maintains a steady value throughout the shocked region. We discuss the effects
of modifying this (probably simplistic) assumption by allowing for a short
decay time. The observations are incompatible with a post-shock field that
decays too rapidly. However if the field pervades only a few percent of the
total thickness of the shocked shell (and the electrons undergo only inverse
Compton losses in the remainder) the model could be compatible with data. This
would suggest a strong dependence of model parameters on the uncertainties of
shock physics, therefore calling for independent external density estimates. We
claim that afterglow emission should be instead seen as a laboratory where we
can understand relativistic shock physics. The model we propose here together
with afterglow observations in all wavebands could help to pin down the field
structure.

of the central dot modulates the size of the tunneling barriers in opposite

of the energy level shift between the outer dots. Using a density matrix
method, we include couplings to external leads and calculate the steady-state
current through the device. The current shows marked resonances which
correspond to avoided-level crossings in the eigenvalue spectrum. When the
tunneling length of the electrons is of order the zero-point position
uncertainty of the quantum oscillator, current far from the electronic
resonance is dominated by electrons hopping on and off the central dot
sequentially; the oscillator can be regarded as shuttling electrons across the

power like growth of hadronic cross sections at high energy. One, the leading
BFKL effect is due to the growth of the parton density, and is characterized by
the leading BFKL exponent. The other mechanism is due to the infrared
diffusion, or the long range nature of the Coulomb field of perturbatively
massless gluons. When perturbative saturation effects are taken into account,
the first mechanism is rendered ineffective but the second one persists. We
suggest that these two distinct mechanisms are responsible for the appearance
of two pomerons. The density growth effects are responsible for the hard
pomeron and manifest themselves in small systems (e.g. gamma^* or small size
fluctuations in the proton wave function) where saturation effects are not
important. The soft pomeron is the manifestation of the exponential growth of
the black saturated regions which appear in typical hadronic systems. We point
out that the nonlinear generalization of the BFKL equation which takes into
account wave function saturation effects (""pomeron loops"") provides a well
defined perturbative framework for the calculation of the soft pomeron
intercept. The conjecture of a perturbative soft pomeron is consistent with
picturing the proton as a loosely bound system of several small black regions
corresponding e.g. to constituent quarks of size about 0.3 fm. Phenomenological
implications of this picture are compatible with the main qualitative features

coupled to gravity is described by an effective 4d field theory of string
theory tachyon. In the model where a tachyon potential $V(T)$ has a quadratic
minimum at finite value of the tachyon field $T_0$ and $V(T_0)=0$, the tachyon
condensate oscillates around its minimum with a decreasing amplitude. It is
shown that its effective equation of state is $p=-\epsilon/3$. However, linear
inhomogeneous tachyon fluctuations coupled to the oscillating background
condensate are exponentially unstable due to the effect of parametric
resonance. In another interesting model, where tachyon potential exponentially
approaches zero at infinity of $T$, rolling tachyon condensate in an expanding
universe behaves as pressureless fluid. Its linear fluctuations coupled with
small metric perturbations evolve similar to these in the pressureless fluid.
However, this linear stage changes to a strongly non-linear one very early, so
that the usual quasi-linear stage observed at sufficiently large scales in the
present Universe may not be realized in the absence of the usual particle-like
cold dark matter.

Euclidean D3-antiD3 pairs embedded in D=10 Lorentzian spacetime. By starting
from a D=10 type IIB supergravity description for the D3-antiD3 pairs and
wrapping one of them over an external 2-sphere, we derive all vacuum solutions
compatible with the symmetry of the problem. Analysing under what condition a
Euclidean brane configuration embedded in a Lorentzian spacetime can lead to a
time-independent spacetime, enables us to single out the embedded D=4
Schwarzschild spacetime as the unique solution generated by the D3-antiD3
pairs. In particular we argue on account of energy-conservation that
time-independent solutions arising from isolated Euclidean branes require those
branes to sit at event horizons. In combination with previous work this

logic and its role in science touching on both experimental design and analysis
of experimental results. In this exploration we demonstrate that the duality
between the logic of assertions and the logic of questions has important
consequences. We discuss the conjecture that the relevance or bearing, b, of a
question on an issue can be expressed in terms of the probabilities, p, of the
assertions that answer the question via the entropy.
  In its application to the scientific method, the logic of questions,
inductive inquiry, can be applied to design an experiment that most effectively
addresses a scientific issue. This is performed by maximizing the relevance of
the experimental question to the scientific issue to be resolved. It is shown
that these results are related to the mutual information between the experiment
and the scientific issue, and that experimental design is akin to designing a
communication channel that most efficiently communicates information relevant
to the scientific issue to the experimenter. Application of the logic of
assertions, inductive inference (Bayesian inference) completes the experimental
process by allowing the researcher to make inferences based on the information
obtained from the experiment.
