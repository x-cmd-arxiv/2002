the spiral galaxy NGC4565 based on archive data of Chandra and the Hubble Space

nucleus of NGC4565 with an X-ray luminosity of Lx= 4.3 10^{39} erg. We show
that its multi-waveband properties are consistent with it being a
low-luminosity active galactic nucleus. A faint optical counterpart with B=25.1
and I=24.0 was identified for the off-nucleus X-ray point source,
RXJ1236.2+2558. Its extinction corrected B magnitude is estimated to be 24.5.
The X-ray to optical flux ratio (fx/fB) is about 540. From the optical and
X-ray properties we argue that RXJ1236.2+2558 is an ultra-luminous X-ray
compact source with Lx=6.5 10^{39} erg. The source is probably located in a
faint globular cluster at the outer edge of NGC4565's bulge.

in the form of a neutral Compton reflection component and a 6.4 keV fluorescent

thus far. We found the broad peaked flaring branch noise that is typical of Sco
X-2, with a centroid frequency in the range 3.3--5.8 Hz. We also discovered low

particular, the low frequency noise we observed was strongest at intermediate

also detected very low frequency noise, and have calculated complex cross

exhibit double-peaked emission line profiles because of disk rotation. Since a
part of the disk having a different line-of-sight velocity is successively
obscured by a companion in eclipsing systems, they show time-varying line
profiles. We calculate time changes of the emission line profiles, assuming
Keplerian rotation fields (v_\phi\propto r^(-1/2) with r being the distance
from the disk center) and the emissivity distribution of j \propto r^(-3/2).
We, then, apply the usual eclipse mapping technique to the light curves at each
of 12-24 wavelengths across the line center to map the region with the same
line-of-sight velocity. The reconstructed images typically exhibit a `two-eye'
pattern for high line-of-sight velocities and we can recover the relation,
v_\phi \propto d^(-1/2), on the assumption of the axisymmetric disk, where d is
the separation between the two `eyes'. We will be able to probe the Keplerian
rotation law, the most fundamental assumption adopted in many disk models, by
high-speed spectroscopic observations with 8-m class telescopes.

tight-binding theory is derived from the principle of local gauge symmetry.
Gauge invariance is shown to be incompatible with empirical tight-binding
theory unless a representation exists in which the coordinate operator is
diagonal. The present approach takes this basis as fundamental and uses group
theory to construct symmetrized linear combinations of discrete coordinate
eigenkets. This produces orthogonal atomic-like ""orbitals"" that may be used as
a tight-binding basis. The coordinate matrix in the latter basis includes
intra-atomic matrix elements between different orbitals on the same atom.
Lattice gauge theory is then used to define discrete electromagnetic fields and
their interaction with electrons. Local gauge symmetry is shown to impose
strong restrictions limiting the range of the Hamiltonian in the coordinate
basis. The theory is applied to the semiconductors Ge and Si, for which it is
shown that a basis of 15 orbitals per atom provides a satisfactory description
of the valence bands and the lowest conduction bands. Calculations of the
dielectric function demonstrate that this model yields an accurate joint
density of states, but underestimates the oscillator strength by about 20% in

sharp peak at hw = 8kBTc for Eexc = 2.18eV, together with a strong enhancement
of the Ca-phonons. Under resonant conditions, the relative positions of the
pair breaking peaks in A1g, B1g, and B2g channels are 2Delta(A1g) = 2Delta(B1g)

the Coulomb screening effect, just as predicted theoretically for a d-wave

building a ladder with two knotted poles: quantum matter field on the right and
spacetime on the left. Each rung connecting the corresponding knots represent a
distinct level of structure. The lowest rung is hydrodynamics and general
relativity; the next rung is semiclassical gravity, with the expectation value
of quantum fields acting as source in the semiclassical Einstein equation. We
recall how ideas from the statistical mechanics of interacting quantum fields
helped us identify the existence of noise in the matter field and its effect on
metric fluctuations, leading to the establishment of the third rung: stochastic
gravity, described by the Einstein-Langevin equation. Our pathway from
stochastic to quantum gravity is via the correlation hierarchy of noise and
induced metric fluctuations. Three essential tasks beckon: 1) Deduce the
correlations of metric fluctuations from correlation noise in the matter field;
2) Reconstituting quantum coherence -- this is the reverse of decoherence --
from these correlation functions 3) Use the Boltzmann-Langevin equations to
identify distinct collective variables depicting recognizable metastable
structures in the kinetic and hydrodynamic regimes of quantum matter fields and
how they demand of their corresponding spacetime counterparts. This will give
us a hierarchy of generalized stochastic equations -- call them the
Boltzmann-Einstein hierarchy of quantum gravity -- for each level of spacetime
structure, from the macroscopic (general relativity) through the mesoscopic
(stochastic gravity) to the microscopic (quantum gravity).

limit of quenched-reduced SU(N) QCD, in terms of a path integral involving pure
string degrees of freedom. It is consistent with the recent results based on
the AdS/CFT correspondence and dual QCD models (dual Higgs model with dual
Dirac strings). More general Loop wave equations in C-spaces (Clifford
manifolds) are proposed in terms of holographic variables that contain the
dynamics of an aggregate of closed branes (p-loops) of various

even though it is of importance for the emergence of classical behavior in the
macroworld, since it will always be the relevant regime for large enough
separations between superposed wave packets. The usual golden-rule treatment
then does not apply but we can employ a short-time expansion for the free

decoherence as a universal short-time phenomenon largely independent of the
