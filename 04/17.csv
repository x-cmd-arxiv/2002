grains, and we use it to diagnose the line-of-sight position, size
distribution, and density of the grains. Using the intrinsic energy resolution
of Chandra's ACIS CCDs and the recent calibration observation of the Chandra

function of energy and off-axis angle. We define a new quantity, the ``halo
coefficient,'' or the total halo intensity relative to the source at 1 keV, and
measure it to be $1.5^{+0.5}_{-0.1}$ for GX 13+1. We find a relationship
between this value and the dust size, density, and hydrogen column density

agree with ``fluffy'' dust models that earlier X-ray halo observations have
supported, and that models including an additional large dust grain population
are not supported by these data.

monitoring the stellar fringe phase shifts of the interferometer. High Doppler
sensitivity is achieved through optimizing the optical delay in the
interferometer and reducing photon noise by measuring multiple fringes over a
broadband. This broadband operation is performed through coupling the
interferometer with a low to medium resolution post-disperser. The total
Doppler sensitivity of this approach is, in theory, independent of dispersing
power of the post-disperser, which allows development of new generation RV
machines with much reduced size, high stability and low cost compared to
echelles. This technique has the potential to improve RV survey efficiency by
2-3 orders of magnitude over cross-dispersed echelle spectroscopy approach to
allow a full sky RV survey for planets once the instrument is operated as a

the electron temperature (T_e) and the fractional mean-square T_e variation
(t_A^2) across the nebula. The WFPC2 T_e map is rather uniform; almost all
values are between 9000 - 11,000 K, with the higher T_e's closely coinciding
with the inner He^++-zone. The results indicate very small values - <~ 0.01 -
for t_A^2 throughout. Our STIS data allow an even more direct determination of
T_e and t_A^2, albeit for a much smaller area than with WFPC2. We present
results from binning the data along the slit into tiles that are 0.5'' square

rule out temperature fluctuations along the line of sight as the cause of the

high frequencies originate in the main-sequence companion and are not
combination frequencies, fi+fj, from the primary. Models for both the primary

and nonradial oscillations. All hot models of the primary with Teff > 8000K are
stable in the observed frequency range. The best fit between the theoretical
and observed frequency ranges is achieved by models with Teff approximately
equal to 7800K (or slightly higher), in agreement with photometric
calibrations. The instability range spans two or three radial orders in the
range p4 to p6 for radial modes. Post-main-sequence models (with or without
overshooting) are preferable for the primary, but main-sequence models with
overshooting cannot be excluded. For the less luminous secondary component the
instability range is wider and spans 5 to 7 radial orders from p2 to p8. The
observed frequencies lie around radial modes p5 to p6. The main uncertainties
of these results are caused by a simple treatment of the convective flux in the

equations. We find that this improvement of the radiative transfer has strong
influence on the resulting vertical structure of the disk, with differences in
temperature as large as 70 %. However, the spectral energy distribution (SED)
is only mildly affected by this change. In fact, the SED compares reasonably
well with that of improved versions of the Chiang & Goldreich (CG) model. This
shows that the latter is a reasonable model for the SED, in spite of its
simplicity. It also shows that from the SED alone, little can be learned about
the vertical structure of a passive circumstellar disk. The molecular line
emission from these disks is more sensitive to the vertical temperature and
density structure, and we show as an example how the intensity and profiles of

more exotic interactions competing one with another. The interplay between
different competitive interactions has a decisive influence on the resulting

simplified form of the derived Hamiltonian can be obtained using additionally
Taylor expansion with respect to $x=\frac{t}{U}$ (t-hopping integral between

Motivated by these experimental observations we consider two different but
related problems: (a) a stochastic lineshape theory for the Kubo-Anderson
oscillator whose frequency modulation follows power-law statistics and (b)
photon counting statistics of quantum dots whose intensity fluctuation is
characterized by power-law kinetics. In the first problem, we derive an
analytical expression for the lineshape formula and find rich type of behaviors
when compared with the standard theory. For example, new type of resonances and
narrowing behavior have been found. We show that the lineshape is extremely
sensitive to the way the system is prepared at time $t=0$ and discuss the
problem of stationarity. In the second problem, we use semiclassical photon
counting statistics to characterize the fluctuation of the photon counts
emitted from quantum dots. We show that the photon counting statistics problem
can be mapped onto a L\'evy walk process. We find unusually large fluctuations

environments is studied. In cycle $t$ action $y_t$ results in perception $x_t$

environmental probability distribution $\mu$. This very general setting
includes, but is not limited to, (partial observable, k-th order) Markov
decision processes. Sequential decision theory tells us how to act in order to
maximize the total expected reward, called value, if $\mu$ is known.
Reinforcement learning is usually used if $\mu$ is unknown. In the Bayesian
approach one defines a mixture distribution $\xi$ as a weighted sum of
distributions $\nu\in\M$, where $\M$ is any class of distributions including
the true environment $\mu$. We show that the Bayes-optimal policy $p^\xi$ based
on the mixture $\xi$ is self-optimizing in the sense that the average value
converges asymptotically for all $\mu\in\M$ to the optimal value achieved by
the (infeasible) Bayes-optimal policy $p^\mu$ which knows $\mu$ in advance. We
show that the necessary condition that $\M$ admits self-optimizing policies at
all, is also sufficient. No other structural assumptions are made on $\M$. As
an example application, we discuss ergodic Markov decision processes, which
allow for self-optimizing policies. Furthermore, we show that $p^\xi$ is
Pareto-optimal in the sense that there is no other policy yielding higher or
equal value in {\em all} environments $\nu\in\M$ and a strictly higher value in
at least one.

leading-twist single-spin asymmetries for a photon polarized normal to a

as measures of hadron distribution amplitudes which are also important for the
analysis of exclusive semi-leptonic and two-body hadronic B-decays.

description of strongly interacting, nonsupersymmetric matter within the
framework of dynamical abelian projection and centerization. The underlying
gauge symmetry is assumed to be SU(N) with N$\gg$1. Appealing to a
thermodynamical treatment, the ground-state structure of the model is
determined by a potential for the inflaton field (monopole condensate) which
allows for nontrivially BPS saturated and thereby stable solutions. For $T<M_P$
this leads to an apparent decoupling of gravity from the inflaton dynamics. The
ground state dynamics implies a heat capacity for the vacuum leading to
inflation for temperatures comparable to the mass scale $M$ of the potential.
The dynamics has an attractor property. In contrast to the usual slow-roll
paradigm we have $m\gg H$ during inflation. As a consequence, density
perturbations generated from the inflaton are irrelevant for the formation of
large-scale structure, and the model has to be supplemented with an inflaton
independent mechanism for the generation of spatial curvature perturbations.
Within a small fraction of the Hubble time inflation is terminated by a
transition of the theory to its center symmetric phase. Due to the prevailing
$Z_{N}$ symmetry relic vector bosons are stabilized and therefore potential
originators of UHECR's beyond the GZK bound.

to the Virasoro algebra and admits a one-parameter family of self-adjoint
extensions described by a real parameter z. When z satisfies a suitable
contraint, the corresponding wavefunctions exhibit scaling behaviour in a
band-like region near the horizon of the black hole. This formalism is
consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula and naturally produces
the -3/2 log M^2 correction term to the black hole entropy with other
subleading corrections exponentially suppressed. This precise form for the
black hole entropy is expected on general grounds in any conformal field
theoretic description of the problem. The presence of the Virasoro algebra and
the scaling properties of the associated wavefunctions in the near-horizon

ideally to calculating semiclassical eigenvalues from periodic orbit data even

due to re- entrant waves, i.e., electrical wave(s) that re-circulate repeatedly
throughout the tissue at a higher frequency than the waves produced by the
heart's natural pacemaker (sinoatrial node). However, the complicated structure
of cardiac tissue, as well as the complex ionic currents in the cell, has made
it extremely difficult to pinpoint the detailed mechanisms of these
life-threatening reentrant arrhythmias. A simplified ionic model of the cardiac
action potential (AP), which can be fitted to a wide variety of experimentally
and numerically obtained mesoscopic characteristics of cardiac tissue such as
AP shape and restitution of AP duration and conduction velocity, is used to
explain many different mechanisms of spiral wave breakup which in principle can
occur in cardiac tissue. Some, but not all, of these mechanisms have been
observed before using other models; therefore, the purpose of this paper is to
demonstrate them using just one framework model and to explain the different
parameter regimes or physiological properties necessary for each mechanism
(such as high or low excitability, corresponding to normal or ischemic tissue,
spiral tip trajectory types, and tissue structures such as rotational
anisotropy and periodic boundary conditions). Each mechanism is compared with
data from other ionic models or experiments to illustrate that they are not
model-specific phenomena. The fact that many different breakup mechanisms exist
has important implications for antiarrhythmic drug design and for comparisons
of fibrillation experiments using different species, electromechanical
uncoupling drugs, and initiation protocols.

contemporary physicists identify the existence of gravity with space-time

the completely linearized scheme, we express the velocity and pressure fields

explicit form for all quantities contained in these relations not imposing any
additional restrictions on the size of particles, distances between them, and
the frequency range. We show the incorrectness of similar results obtained
earlier by several authors because these results are expressed in terms of
nonexistent inverse tensors. We explain the reasons leading to this and propose
a procedure for the elimination of divergent quantities. In the stationary
case, using the proposed procedure, we obtained the translational, rotational,

number of spheres up to, respectively, the second, forth, and third orders in

the reorientation energy results in the transition of proton charge from the
surrounding to the inner water molecules in the chain. Proton migration along
the chain in an external electric field has a step-like character, proceeding
with the occurrence of electric field threshold-type effects and drastic
redistribution of proton charge. Electric field applied to correlated chains
induces first a formation of ordered dipole structures for lower field
strength, and than, with a further field strength increase, a stabilization of
states with Bjerrum D-defects. We analyze the main factors responsible for the
formation/annihilation of Bjerrum defects showing the strong influence of the
complex interplay between reorientation energy, electric field and temperature

angular- momentum ($\ell$) states which lie below and above the adjacent
manifold in highly excited Rb Rydberg atoms. The method fully exploits the
pulsed field-ionization characteristics of the manifold states in high
slew-rate regime: Specifically the low $\ell$ state below (above) the adjacent
manifold is firstly transferred to the lowest (highest) state in the manifold
via the adiabatic transition at the first avoided crossing in low slew-rate
regime, and then the atoms are driven to a high electric field for ionization
in high slew-rate regime. These extreme states of the manifold are ionized at
quite different fields due to the tunneling process, resulting in thus the
stringent selectivity. Two manipulation schemes to realize this method actually
are demonstrated here experimentally.

scattering calculations based on a so called pseudo-time Schroedinger equation,

  The method utilizes a special energy-dependent form for the absorbing
potential in the time-independent Schroedinger equation, in which the complex
energy spectrum E_k is mapped to u_k inside the unit disk, where u_k are the
eigenvalues of some explicitly known sparse matrix U.
  Most importantly for the numerical implementation, all the physical
eigenvalues u_k are extreme eigenvalues of U, which allows one to extract these
eigenvalues very efficiently by harmonic inversion of a pseudo-time
autocorrelation function using the filter diagonalization method. The
computation of 2T steps of the autocorrelation function requires only T sparse
real matrix-vector multiplications.
  We describe and compare different schemes, effectively corresponding to
different choices of the energy-dependent absorbing potential, and test them
numerically by calculating resonances of the HCO molecule. Our numerical tests
suggest an optimal scheme that provide accurate estimates for most resonance
states.

conditions on L. Four of them are shown to be physically necessary. The last
one relates the orthogonality between states in each system to the
ortho-complementation of L. It can be justified if one assumes that the
orthogonality between states in the total system induces the
ortho-complementation of L. We prove that if L satisfies these five conditions,
then L is the separated product proposed by Aerts in 1982 to describe
independent quantum systems (theorem 2). Finally, we give strong arguments to
exclude the separated product and therefore our last condition. As a
consequence, we ask whether among the ca-lattices that satisfy our first four
basic necessary conditions, there exists an ortho-complemented one different
