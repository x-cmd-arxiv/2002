produced excellent broad-band photometric and spectroscopic coverage over a

obtained at times up to about 60 days, if we allow for extended nickel mixing.
Later than about 60 days the observed Balmer lines become stronger than our
models can reproduce. We show that this is likely due to a more complicated
distribution of gamma-rays than we allow for in our spherically symmetric
calculations. We present synthetic light curves in UBVRIJHK and a synthetic
bolometric light curve. Using this broad baseline of detailed spectroscopic
models we find a distance modulus mu = 18.5 +/- 0.2 using the SEAM method of
determining distances to supernovae. We find that the explosion time agrees
with that of the neutrino burst and is constrained at 68% confidence to within
+/- 0.9 days. We argue that the weak Balmer lines of our detailed model
calculations casts doubt on the accuracy of the purely photometric EPM method.
We also suggest that Type IIP supernovae will be most useful as distance
indicators at early times due to a variety of effects.

emission to peak in a shell partially surrounding the peak of dust extinction.
Moreover, the N2H+ peaks inside the much larger C18O depletion hole and has a
smaller depletion zone, confirming theoretical predictions. These data are
analyzed through a direct coupling of time dependent chemical models to a
radiation transfer code. This analysis highlights the importance of
photodissociation at cloud edges and suggests that the CO abundance declines by
two orders of magnitude from edge to center. In contrast N2H+ declines in
abundance, at minimum, by at least a factor of two. Indeed it is entirely
possible that both N2H+ and N2 are completely absent from the central regions

possibility that the centers of dense cores, prior to the formation of a star,

their simulations, which was developed by Nakamura et al (and widely cited as
Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura system). This so-called BSSN formulation is
shown to be more stable than the standard ADM formulation in many cases, and
there have been many attempts to explain why this re-formulation has such an
advantage. We try to explain the background mechanism of the BSSN equations by
using eigenvalue analysis of constraint propagation equations. This analysis
has been applied and has succeeded in explaining other systems in our series of
works. We derive the full set of the constraint propagation equations, and
study it in the flat background space-time. We carefully examine how the
replacements and adjustments in the equations change the propagation structure
of the constraints, i.e. whether violation of constraints (if it exists) will
decay or propagate away. We conclude that the better stability of the BSSN
system is obtained by their adjustments in the equations, and that the
combination of the adjustments is in a good balance, i.e. a lack of their
adjustments might fail to obtain the present stability. We further propose
other adjustments to the equations, which may offer more stable features than
the current BSSN equations.

correlation currents are set up fully respecting the gauge invariance of the
theory. Emphasis is placed on the self-energy current which, being infinite,
needs to be renormalized. This is achieved starting in the Hartree-Fock
framework and then expanding the Hartree-Fock current to first order in the
square of the pion coupling constant to obtain a truly, gauge invariant,
one-pion-exchange current. The model is applied to the calculation of the

the coupling to the continuum in the exit channel. Using the Continuum
Discretized Coupled Channels (CDCC) formalism, we find that these effects are
important for the description of the elastic scattering observables. However,
for the transfer process, differences between the predictions of the
differential cross section within the Distorted Wave Born Approximation (DWBA)
and the CDCC-Born approximation (CDCC-BA) are found to be negligible. This
result supports the use of the DWBA method as a reliable tool to extract the
$S_{17}(0)$ factor in this case.

biologically active only in salty aqueous media where its charge is compensated
by solvent counterions. Monovalent metal ions are ubiquitous in DNA environment
and they are usually considered as the possible driving force of
sequence-dependent modulations of DNA structure that make it recognizable by
proteins. In an effort to directly examine this hypothesis, MD simulations of
DNA in a water drop surrounded by vacuum were carried out, which relieves the
requirement of charge neutrality. Surprisingly, with zero concentration of
counterions a dodecamer DNA duplex appears metastable and its structure remains
similar to that observed in experiments.

examining hydrodynamic flow near the surface of a fiber optic sensor. An
analysis of the conservation of momentum, the continuity equation and the
Navier-Stokes equation for compressible flow was used to develop expressions
for the velocity and the density as a function of the distance along the flow
and above a two dimensional flat surface. When examining the flow near the
surface, these expressions can be used to estimate the sensitivity required to
perform direct optical measurements and to parameterize the shear force for
indirect optical measurements. The use of these results allows for direct
modeling of sensors using the optical properties of the flow field. Future work
includes analyzing the optical parametric design of fiber optic sensors,
modeling sensors to utilize those parameters for optimal measurements involving
different mixtures of fluid flow.

oscillation, a natural choice is that neutrinos may be spacelike particles with
a tiny mass. To keep causality for spacelike particles, a kinematic time under
a non-standard form of the Lorentz transformation is introduced, which is
related to a preferred frame. A Dirac-type equation for spacelike neutrinos is
further investigated and its solutions are discussed. This equation can be
written in two spinor equations coupled together via nonzero mass while
respecting maximum parity violation. As a consequence, parity violation implies
that the principle of relativity is violated in the weak interaction.
