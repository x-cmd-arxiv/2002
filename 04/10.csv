using composite spectra, we are able to show that the apparent shift of the CIV
emission line peak is not a shift so much as it is a lack of flux in the red

strongly constrain models for the broad emission line region in quasars. The
emission line blueshift and equivalent width of CIV are also discussed in light
of the Baldwin Effect and as a function of other quasar properties such as

distribution of standard candles, valid for all cosmological models, with
arbitrary matter distributions, over all redshifts. Our results are based on a
universal probability distribution function (UPDF), $P(\eta)$, for the reduced
convergence, $\eta$. For a given cosmological model, the magnification
probability distribution, $P(\mu)$, at redshift $z$ is related to the UPDF by
$P(\mu)=P(\eta)/2|\kappa_{min}|$, where $\eta=1+(\mu-1)/(2|\kappa_{min}|)$, and
$\kappa_{min}$ (the minimum convergence) can be directly computed from the
cosmological parameters ($\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$). We show that the
UPDF can be well approximated by a three-parameter stretched Gaussian
distribution, where the values of the three parameters depend only on
$\xi_\eta$, the variance of $\eta$. In short, all possible weak lensing
probability distributions can be well approximated by a one-parameter family.
We establish this family, normalizing to the numerical ray-shooting results for
a ${\Lambda}$CDM model by Wambsganss et al. (1997). Each alternative
cosmological model is then described by a single function $\xi_\eta(z)$. We
find that this method gives $P(\mu)$ in excellent agreement with numerical
ray-tracing and three-dimensional shear matrix calculations, and provide
numerical fits for three representative models (SCDM, $\Lambda$CDM, and OCDM).
Our results provide an easy, accurate, and efficient method to calculate the
weak lensing magnification distribution of standard candles, and should be
useful in the analysis of future high-redshift supernova data.

moving in a curved inhomogeneous magnetic field. The consideration of the
gradient makes the curved vacuum magnetic field compatible with the Maxwell
equations and adds a non-trivial term to the transverse drift velocity and,
consequently, to the general radiation spectrum. To obtain the radiation
spectrum in the classical domain a general expression for the spectral
distribution and characteristic frequency of an electron in arbitrary motion is
derived by using Schwinger's method. The radiation patterns of the
ultrarelativistic electron are represented in terms of the acceleration of the
particle. The same results can be obtained by considering that the motion of
the electron can be formally described as an evolution due to magnetic and
electric forces. By defining an effective electromagnetic field, which combines
the magnetic field with the fictitious electric field associated to the
curvature and drift motion, one can obtain all the physical characteristics of
the radiation by replacing the constant magnetic field with the effective
field. The power, angular distribution and spectral distribution of all three
components (synchrotron, curvature and gradient) of the radiation are
considered in both classical and quantum domain in the framework of this
unified formalism. In the quantum domain the proposed approach allows the study
of the effects of the inhomogeneities and curvature of the magnetic field on
the radiative transitions rates of electrons between low-lying Landau levels

emission-line flux ratio of [N II]6583/H_alpha in combination with some other
optical emission-line flux ratios. This method, which has been often applied to
Seyfert 2 galaxies, suggests that the gas metallicity of narrow-line regions is
indistinguishable or possibly higher in BLS1s than in NLS1s. On the contrary,
the other method in which only forbidden emission-line fluxes are used results
in that NLS1s tend to possess metal-richer gas in the narrow-line regions than
BLS1s. We point out that this inconsistency may be owing to the contamination
of the broad component of permitted lines into the narrow component of ones in
the first method. Since the results derived by using only forbidden
emission-line fluxes do not suffer from any uncertainty of the fitting function
for the broad component of Balmer lines, the results from this method are more
reliable than those derived by using permitted lines. We thus conclude that the
gas metallicity of narrow-line regions tends to be higher in NLS1s than in

  Letters",,"10.1086/341122",,"astro-ph",,"  The X-ray emission from normal elliptical galaxies has two major components:
soft emission from diffuse gas and harder emission from populations of
accreting (low-mass) stellar X-ray binaries (LMXB). If LMXB populations are
tied to the field stellar populations in galaxies, their total X-ray
luminosities should be proportional to the optical luminosities of galaxies.
However, recent ASCA and Chandra X-ray observations show that the global
luminosities of LMXB components in ellipticals exhibit significant scatter at a
given optical luminosity. This scatter may reflect a range of evolutionary
stages among LMXB populations in ellipticals of different ages. If so, the
ratio of the global LMXB X-ray luminosity to the galactic optical luminosity,
L_LMXB/L_opt, may be used to determine when the bulk of stars were formed in
individual ellipticals. To test this, we compare variations in L_LMXB/L_opt for
LMXB populations in ellipticals to optically-derived estimates of stellar ages
in the same galaxies. We find no correlation, implying that L_LMXB/L_opt
variations are not good age indicators for ellipticals. Alternatively, LMXBs
may be formed primarily in globular clusters (through stellar tidal
interactions), rather than in the stellar fields of galaxies. Since elliptical
galaxies exhibit a wide range of globular cluster populations for a given
galaxian luminosity, this may induce a dispersion in the LMXB populations of
ellipticals with similar optical luminosities. Indeed, we find that
L_LMXB/L_opt ratios for LMXB populations are strongly correlated with the
specific globular cluster frequencies in elliptical galaxies. This suggests
that most LMXBs were formed in globular clusters.

efficient evaporation and a weaker corona. We also found a strong dependence on
the viscosity, higher viscosity leading to an enhanced mass flow in the corona

rates in units of the Eddington rate our results become independent on the mass

there any evidence for a measurable interband lag, with robust upper limits of
$| \tau | < 0.08 $ hr in the best-correlated light curves. This is in conflict
with previous claims of both hard and soft lags of ~1 hr in this and other
blazars. However, previous observations suffered a repeated 1.6 hr feature
induced by the low-Earth orbital period, a feature that is not present in the
uninterrupted XMM-Newton data. The new upper limit on $|\tau|$ leads to a lower

system is driven out of equilibrium either by considering different values for
the noise strengths in the Langevin equations describing the evolution of the
dynamic variables (effectively placing these at different temperatures), or
more generally by allowing for anisotropic noise strengths, i.e., by
constraining the dynamics to be at different temperatures in d_par- and
d_perp-dimensional subspaces, respectively. In the first, case, we find one
infrared-stable and one unstable renormalization group fixed point. At the
stable fixed point, detailed balance is dynamically restored, with the two
noise strengths becoming asymptotically equal. The ensuing critical behavior is
that of the standard equilibrium model H. At the novel unstable fixed point,
the temperature ratio for the dynamic variables is renormalized to infinity,
resulting in an effective decoupling between the two modes. We compute the
critical exponents at this new fixed point to one-loop order. For model H with
spatially anisotropic noise, we observe a critical softening only in the
d_perp-dimensional sector in wave vector space with lower noise temperature.
The ensuing effective two-temperature model H does not have any stable fixed
point in any physical dimension, at least to one-loop order. We obtain formal

Bloch wave, there are N-1 states in the finite crystal and their energies are
dependent on the crystal length L but not on the crystal boundary tau and map
the energy band exactly; There is always one and only one electronic state
correponding to each band gap of the Bloch wave, whose energy is dependent on
the crystal boundary tau but not on the crystal length L. This state is either
a constant energy confined state at a band edge or a surface state in the gap.
A slight change of the boundary tau could change the property and energy of
this state dramaticaly.

series by means of the method of diffusion entropy. For this purpose, we first
study the case when infinitely many time series, as different realizations of
the same dynamic process, are available, so as to adopt the Gibbs ensemble
perspective. We solve the problem of establishing under which conditions
scaling emerges from within this perspective. Then, we study the more
challenging problem of creating a diffusion process from only one single
(non-stationary) time series. The conversion of this single sequence into many
diffusional trajectories is equivalent to creating a non-Gibbsian ensemble.
However, adopting a probabilistic approach to evaluate the contribution of any
system of this non-Gibbsian ensemble, and using for it the theoretical Gibbsian
prescription of the earlier case, we find a recipe that fits accurately the
numerical results. With the help of this recipe we show that nonstationary time
series produce either anomalous scaling with ordinary statistics or ordinary
scaling with anomalous statistics. From this recipe we also derive an
attractive way to explain the entropy time evolution, as resulting from two
distinct uncertainty sources, the lack of information on the trajectory initial
condition, and the lack of control on random trajectories.

the theoretical foundations of the approach, we first identify the parameters
of the theory playing a key role and obtain simple requirements to be met by a
schematic model for its use in this context. Then we compare the results

potential biases in the method are identified and ruled out by the choice of
appropriate models. Finally, reference spectra computed from the mode-coupling
theory for a model simple liquid are analyzed along the same lines as
experimental data, allowing us to show that, despite the strong simplification
in the description of the dynamics it involves, the method is free from
spurious artifacts and provides accurate estimates of important parameters of
the theory. The only exception is the exponent parameter, the evaluation of
which is hindered, as for other methods, by corrections to the asymptotic laws

  of Magnetic Surfaces","Conference: CMD19CMMP 2002",,,,"cond-mat",,"  Recently, there has been a revival of interest in mechanisms for changing the
spin polarization of an electron beam on transmission through, or reflection
from, a magnetic surface. An understanding of these mechanisms would allow the
use of an electron beam as a polarized radiation probe for magnetic
characterization, like light in MOKE and neutrons in PNR. Here, a mechanism is
described which, unlike simultaneously occurring processes proposed elsewhere,
polarizes an unpolarized incident beam without recourse to inelastic processes.
  A magnetic field leads to a Zeeman term in an electron's Hamiltonian, which
depends on the angle theta between the electron's spin vector and the magnetic
flux. As a result, when an electron wave is incident on the surface of a bulk
magnetic material (figure 1,) the wave-number of the transmitted wave depends
on theta. When the conditions of continuity of the wave-function, and of its
first spatial derivative, at the surface, and conservation of particles, are
applied, an electron reflection coefficient is obtained which also depends on
theta. Therefore, some polarizations are preferentially reflected, while others
are preferentially transmitted. The amplitude reflection and transmission
coefficients can readily be converted to intensity coefficients, and averaged
over an incoherent superposition of electron waves of different theta, e.g. an
unpolarized incident beam. The reflected polarization is P = -(2 e mu_B V B)/(3
e^2 V^2 + mu_B^2 B^2), which can take values -1/sqrt(3) <= P <= 1/sqrt(3),
depending on the balance between V and B.
  The analysis can be extended to multi-layers using the theory of Fabry-Perot
etalons.

same functional equations in terms of elliptic functions as the exact
S-matrices of the $\phi_{1,2}$ perturbation do in terms of trigonometric
functions. In particular, the bootstrap equation corresponding to a self-fusing
process is recovered. For the special cases $L=3,4,6$ corresponding to the
Ising model in a magnetic field, and the leading thermal perturbations of the
tricritical Ising and three-state Potts model, as well as for the unrestricted

geometry also allows for a single formula in generic Lie algebraic terms

a lifetime limit of $\tau/m \agt 10^{-4}$ s/eV. However, there are many

There is an obvious degeneracy between the neutrino lifetime and the mixing
parameters. More generally, one must also allow the possibility of active
daughter neutrinos and/or antineutrinos, which may partially conceal the
characteristic features of decay. Many of the most exotic possibilities that
presently complicate the extraction of a decay bound will be removed if the

solution to the solar neutrino problem and measures the mixing parameters
precisely. Better experimental and theoretical constraints on the $^8$B

results inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence conjecture. Our techniques
exploit a special geometric feature which the universal cover of the soliton
spacetime shares with familiar ``ground state'' spacetimes such as Minkowski
spacetime, namely, the presence of a null line, or complete achronal null
geodesic, and the totally geodesic null hypersurface that it determines. En
route, we provide an analysis of the boundary data at conformal infinity for
the Lorentzian signature static Einstein equations, in the spirit of the
Fefferman-Graham analysis for the Riemannian signature case. This leads us to
generalize to arbitrary dimension a mass definition for static asymptotically
AdS spacetimes given by Chru\'sciel and Simon. We prove equivalence of this
mass definition with those of Ashtekar-Magnon and Hawking-Horowitz.

this result suggests that the transfer of enstrophy to smaller scales is

basin fraction of Milnor attractors increases drastically around 5-10 degrees
of freedom, saturating for higher numbers of degrees of freedom. It is argued
that this dominance of Milnor attractors in the basin arises from a
combinatorial explosion of the basin boundaries. In addition, the dominance is
also found in a system without permutation symmetry, i,e., a coupled dynamical
system of non-identical elements. Possible relevance to the magic number $7\pm

For such purpose, the Lorenz problem is reformulated in a classical mechanical
form and it turns out to be equivalent to the problem of a damped and forced
one dimensional motion of a particle in a two-well potential, with a forcing
term depending on the ``memory'' of the particle past motion. The dynamics of
the original Lorenz system in the new particle phase space can then be
rewritten in terms of an one-dimensional first-exit-time problem. The emergence
of chaos turns out to be due to the discontinuous solutions of the
transcendental equation ruling the time for the particle to cross the
intermediate potential wall. The whole problem is tackled analytically deriving
a piecewise linearized Lorenz-like system which preserves all the essential
properties of the original model.
