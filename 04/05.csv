have also analysed 3 extremely metal-poor candidates from the HK survey, and 3
additional bright metal-poor stars. With this work, we have doubled the number
of extremely metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]$\le 3.0$) with high-precision abundance
analyses. Our sample of extremely metal-poor candidates from the HES contains 3

are only slightly more metal rich. Thus, the chain of procedures that led to
the selection of these stars from the HES successfully provides a high fraction
of extremely metal-poor stars. We verify that our stellar parameters, derived
in Paper I, lead to acceptable ionization and excitation balances for Fe,
ruling out substantial non-LTE effects in Fe. For the $\alpha-$elements Mg, Si,
Ca, Ti, the light element Al, the iron-peak elements Sc, Cr, Mn, and the
neutron capture elements Sr and Ba, we find trends in abundance ratios [X/Fe]
similar to those found by previous studies. However,the scatter in most of
these ratios, even at [Fe/H]$\le -3.0$ dex, is surprisingly small. Only Sr and
Ba show scatter larger than the expected errors. Future work (the 0Z project)
will provide much stronger constraints on the scatter (or lack thereof) in
abundances for a greater number of stars. We discuss the implications of these
results for the early chemical evolution of the Galaxy, including such issues
as the number of contributing SN, and the sizes of typical fragments in which
they were born. In addition, we have identified a very metal poor star that
appears to be the result of the s-process chain, operating in a very metal-poor
environment, with extremely enhanced C, Ba, and Pb, and somewhat enhanced Sr.

the spectra show significant differences in the NV and CIV emission line
profiles, and there is no luminous galaxy at the anticipated lens position.
Rather, we interpret this pair as the highest redshift known example of a
binary quasar. The redshift difference of 661+/-173 km/s between the two
components is inconsistent with the lensing expectation, but is consistent with
the line of sight velocity difference of a bound pair of galaxies. The spectra
show associated, narrow metal absorption in highly ionized species of C and N,
with a systemic velocity difference of 492+/-6 km/s. It is likely that this
absorption arises in a group or cluster of galaxies surrounding the quasar
pair. After a thorough search, the Large Bright Quasar Survey (LBQS) is known
to contain one gravitational lens and four probable binary pairs. The existence
of close binaries is evidence that quasar activity can be triggered by galaxy
interactions. We speculate that the close pair LBQS 0015+0239 is a rare example
of the pre-merger state of two supermassive black holes.

calculated expansion law and the radio-, X-ray and gamma-ray emissions produced
by the accelerated CRs in SN 1006 agree quite well with the observations. A
rather large interior magnetic field B_d\approx 100 \muG is required to give a
good fit for the radio and X-ray synchrotron emission. In the predicted TeV
gamma-ray flux from SN 1006, the pi^0-decay gamma-rays, generated by the
nuclear CR component, dominate over the inverse Compton (IC) gamma-rays,
generated by the CR electrons in the cosmic microwave background. The predicted
source morphology in high energy gamma-rays roughly corresponds to that of the
synchrotron emission. The predicted integral gamma-ray flux F \propto e^-1
extends up to energies 100 TeV if CR diffusion is as strong as the Bohm limit.
Only if the interior magnetic field is much lower in the SNR, B_d\approx 10
\muG, then the observed gamma-ray emission can be due to the accelerated
electron component alone. In this case, not plausible physically in our view,
the lowest permissible value of the electron to proton ratio is rather high,
and the maximum individual energy and total energy content of accelerated
nucleons so small, that SN 1006 can not be considered as a typical source of

study the possibility for an observational detection of oscillations in the

suggest a new cosmological test using the angular power spectrum of dark matter
halos, or clusters of galaxies detected via wide-field surveys of the large

of the matter power spectrum and baryon oscillation peaks in projection. The
test allows a measurement of the angular diameter distance as a function of
redshift, similar to the distance to the last scattering surface from the first
acoustic peak in the temperature anisotropy power spectrum. The simultaneous
detection of oscillations in both photons and baryons will provide a strong,
and a necessary, confirmation of our understanding related to the physics

combined analysis of CMB data from missions such as the MAP and the large scale

C = a_0 / R, where a_0 is the Bohr radius and R is the radius of the cylinder.
We find that the energetics of binding exhibits a monotonic trend as a function
of C ; the known 1D and 2D limits of E_B are reproduced accurately by our
calculation. E_B is relatively insensitive to curvature for small C .
  Its value is ~ 1% higher at C = 1 than at C = 0. This weak dependence is
confirmed by a perturbation theory calculation. The high curvature regime
approximates the 1D Coulomb model; within our variational approach, E_B has a
logarithmic divergence as R approaches zero. The proposed variational method is
applied to the case of donors in single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs).

the leading order operator for this exchange is dimension six, in contrast to

right-handed neutrino singlet \nu_{\ell R}. We assume that all Yukawa-coupling
matrices are diagonal, but the Majorana mass matrix M_R of the right-handed
neutrino singlets is an arbitrary symmetric matrix, thereby introducing an
explicit but soft violation of all lepton numbers. We investigate
lepton-flavor-violating processes within this model. We pay particular
attention to the large-m_R behavior of the amplitudes for these processes,
where m_R is the order of magnitude of the matrix elements of M_R. While the
amplitudes for processes like tau^- --> mu^- gamma and Z --> tau^+ mu^- drop as
1/m_R^2 for arbitrary n_H, processes like tau^- --> mu^- e^+ e^- and mu^- -->
e^- e^+ e^- obey this power law only for n_H = 1. For n_H \geq 2, on the
contrary, those amplitudes do not fall off when m_R increases, rather they
converge towards constants. This non-decoupling of the right-handed scale
occurs because of the sub-process ell^- --> ell'^- {S_b^0}^*, where S_b^0 is a
neutral scalar which subsequently decays to e^+ e^-. That sub-process has a
contribution from charged-scalar exchange which, for n_H \geq 2, does not
decrease when m_R tends to infinity. We also perform a general study of the
non-decoupling and argue that, after performing the limit m_R --> \infty and
removing the \nu_R from the Lagrangian, our model becomes a multi-Higgs-doublet
Standard Model with suppressed flavor-changing Yukawa couplings. Finally, we
show that, with the usual assumptions about the mass scales in the seesaw
mechanism, the branching ratios of all lepton-flavor-changing processes are
several orders of magnitude smaller than present experimental limits.

Accepted by ApJ",,"10.1086/341192",,"nlin.AO astro-ph",,"  We present ROSAT PSPC and ASCA observations of the supernova remnant (SNR)
W28. The overall shape of X-ray emission in W28 is elliptical, dominated by a
centrally-concentrated interior emission, sharply peaked at the center. The
ASCA spectra reveal emission lines of Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe K$\alpha$ and
continuum extending at least up to 7 keV, showing thermal origin with a hot
thermal component. We found that spectral variations are present in W28. The
southwestern shell can be fit well by a plane-shock model with a temperature of
1.5 keV, and the northeastern shell, with a lower temperature of 0.56 keV.
Unlike for the southwestern and northeastern shells, the central emission
requires a two-temperature components with 0.6 keV and 1.8 keV. The low
temperature component is similar to those seen in other Mixed-morphology SNRs.
The X-ray luminosity of W28 is 6x 10^34 ergs/s, and the estimated X-ray mass is
only ~20 - 25 solar mass. A comparison of W28 with other typical
Mixed-morphology SNRs reveals significant differences in its X-ray properties;
W28 has a significantly higher temperature and noticeable spectral variations.
W28 belongs to a class of SNRs considered by Chevalier (1999), with a radiative
shell interacting with clumpy molecular clouds. X-ray emission at its center is
a ``fossil'' radiation from gas which was shocked early in the evolution of the
remnant, and its centrally-peaked morphology could have been caused by
processes such as evaporation, electron thermal conduction, and mixing induced
by various hydrodynamical instabilities. But W28 poses a challenge for existing
models of X-ray emission, because the evaporation model of White & Long (1991)
is in conflict with observations, while the presence of temperature variations
seems inconsistent with SNR models with efficient thermal conduction.

splittings between baryons which are comparable to those arising from the
residual interactions between the quarks. These corrections are calculated
using a pair-creation model to give the momentum-dependent vertices, and a
model which includes configuration mixing to describe the wave functions of the
baryons. A large set of baryon-meson intermediate states are employed, with all
allowed SU(3)_f combinations, and excitations of the intermediate baryon states
up to and including the second band of negative-parity excited states. Roughly
half of the splitting between the nucleon and Delta ground states arises from
loop effects. The effects of such loops on the spectrum of negative-parity
excited states are examined, and the resulting splittings are sensitive to
configuration mixing caused by the residual interactions between the quarks.
With reduced-strength one-gluon-exchange interactions between the quarks fit to
the Delta-nucleon splitting, a comparison is made between model masses and the
bare masses required to fit the masses of the states extracted from data
analyses. This shows that it is necessary to also adjust the string tension or
the quark mass to fit the splitting between the average bare masses of the
ground states and negative-parity excited states, and that spin-orbit effects
are likely to be important.
