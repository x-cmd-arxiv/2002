inner Lindblad resonances into the nuclear regions, where it can fuel active or
starburst nuclei. Thus far, the existence of double bars has been determined
predominantly through analysis of near infrared images, which can tell us
little about the dynamics and inflow rates of these systems. We have observed
two double bar galaxy candidates (NGC 2273 and NGC 5728) in CO J=1-0 with the
Owens Valley Radio Observatory Millimeter Array. Despite the similarity in the
near infrared images of these galaxies, we see rather different nuclear
morphologies in the CO maps. NGC 2273 shows evidence of a nuclear gas bar,
aligned with the nuclear stellar bar seen in the near infrared images. Both the
nuclear gaseous and stellar bars are misaligned from the large scale bar by
approximately 90 degrees, which also allows the possibility that both are the
result of stars and gas populating the $x_2$ orbits of the primary bar.
Estimates using dynamical friction arguments and star formation rates suggest
significant gas inflow rates along the nuclear bar of NGC 2273. Conversely, NGC
5728 does not show any evidence for a nuclear molecular bar, but shows an arc
of CO clumps that peaks just to the south-west of the dynamical center and
curves to the south-east where it follows the dust lane to the south. Models of
double-barred galaxies suggest that these galaxies should contain large amounts
of molecular gas in their nuclei. Our calculations suggest that both galaxies
contain sufficient amounts of gas in their nuclei, but only NGC 2273 shows
evidence for a nuclear gas bar. This may be the result of past episodes of star
formation exhausting and dispersing the nuclear gas of NGC 5728, but is more
likely evidence that NGC 5728 has undergone a minor merger event.

flow is effecting the kinematics of its surrounding medium, and has been able
to redistribute considerable amounts of the surrounding medium-density gas in
its star-forming core as well at parsec-scale distances from the source. The
giant molecular outflow HH 315 is a highly asymmetric bipolar flow with a
projected linear extent of about 2 pc. Our results indicate that the two
outflow lobes are each interacting with the ambient medium in different ways.
The southern (redshifted) lobe interacts with a dense ambient medium, very
close to the young stellar outflow source, and its kinetic energy is comparable
to both the turbulent and gravitational binding energy of its host cloud. In
addition, we find evidence that the southern lobe is responsible for the
creation of a cavity in the 13CO emission. In contrast, the northern (mainly
blueshifted) outflow lobe extends farther from PV Ceph and interacts with
ambient gas much less dense than the southern lobe. There is very little 13CO
emission north of the outflow source, and the only prominent 13CO emission is a
shell-like structure coincident with the outer edge of the northern lobe, about
1.2 pc northwest of PV Ceph. It appears that the northern lobe of the HH 315
outflow has been able to ``push'' aside a substantial fraction of the gas in
the area, piling it in a dense shell-like structure at its edges. In addition,

at the nuclei of nearby dead quasars, those in which the putative underlying
supermassive black holes are suitably spun-up. Based on galactic optical
luminosity, morphological type, and redshift, we have compiled a small sample
of nearby objects selected to be highly luminous, bulge-dominated galaxies,

correlated with the arrival directions of cosmic rays detected at energies $>

correlation appears at closer angular scales than those expected when taking
into account the deflection caused by typically assumed IGM or galactic

luminosity as a function of metallicity for a large sample of starburst
galaxies. We find that the variation of the star formation efficiency, in the
framework of continuous star formation models, produce a scatter equivalent to
what is observed in the N/O versus O/H diagram for low-mass HII galaxies only.
However, continous star formation models are unable to reproduce i) the scatter
observed for massive starburst and UV-selected galaxies in the N/O versus O/H
relation, and ii) the scatter in the luminosity versus O/H scaling relation
observed for the whole sample of starburst galaxies. The dispersion associated
with the distribution of N/O as a function of metallicity, for both low-mass

formation models. It is interpreted as a consequence of the time-delay between
the ejection of nitrogen and that of oxygen into the ISM. These models also
reproduce the spread observed in the luminosity-metallicity relation.
Metal-rich spiral galaxies differ from metal-poor ones by a higher star
formation efficiency and starburst frequency. Low-mass galaxies experienced a
few bursts of star formation whereas massive spiral galaxies experienced

liquid are defined as configurations which correspond to absolute minima of the
pseudo-potential surface, $W =\wf$, as identified by a multi-dimensional
minimisation procedure. The sensitivity of statistical properties of inherent
saddles to the convergence criteria of the minimisation procedure is
investigated using, as a test system, a simple liquid bound by a quadratically
shifted Lennard-Jones pair potential with continuous zeroth, first and second
derivatives at the cut-off distance. The variation in statistical properties of
saddles is studied over a range of error tolerances spanning five orders of
magnitude. The largest value of the tolerance corresponds to that used for the
unshifted LJ liquids in a previous work (J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 115}, 8784
(2001)). Based on our results, it is clear that there are no qualitative
changes in statistical properties of saddles over this range of error
tolerances and even the quantitative changes are small. The lowest magnitude
eigenvalue, $| \omega_0^2|$, of the Hessian is, however, found to be very
sensitive to the tolerance; as the tolerance is decreased, $| \omega_0^2|$ is
found to show an overall decrease. This indicates that if convergence criteria
are not strict, absolute or low-lying minima of $W(\br)$ will be diagnosed as
having no inflexion directions. The results also show that it is not possible
to set up an unambiguous numerical criterion to further classify the
quasi-saddles into true saddles which contain no zero curvature,
non-translational normal modes and inflexion points which have one or more
zero-curvature normal mode directions.

membrane lipids and the peptide. Our model lipid has a head group of three
hydrophilic beads and a tail of seven hydrophobic beads, while the model
peptide is a block-copolymer made of hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks, with
total length of 200 beads. In addition, each water molecule is represented by a
single bead which has considerably larger interaction energy. We first confirm
that our present lipid model can support spontaneous formation of bilayers in
water. Then we place the model peptide near the bilayers and monitor the
microscopic process of the adsorption, insertion, and translocation of the
peptide. When the peptide molecule is set free to interact with the membrane,
the hydrophobic blocks of the peptide strongly favor intimate contact with the
lipid tails. This strong attractive interaction gives rise to a severe membrane
perturbation, which leads to the formation of a pore, though short-lived, in
the membrane. It is found that the side-surface of the pore is almost covered
with the hydrophilic heads of the lipids, which seems to help the hydrophilic
blocks of the peptide translocate across the membrane. We also monitor the rate
of flip-flop inversion of the directions of lipids, and we find it markedly
increases during the peptide contact and insertion. The peptide
insertion/translocation, the formation of membrane pore, and the flip-flop

a torsional analog of Josephson piezomagnetism (and related magnetomechanical
effect) as well as a possible generation of a heat flux induced magnetic moment
in a weakly-coupled superconductor under a torsional deformation (analog of
Zavaritskii effect) along with the concomitant phenomena of piezothermopower
and piezothermal conductivity. The conditions under which the predicted effects

other performance characteristics quite similar to those using the 241Am

certain basic properties and give certain examples, where the notion of

punctuated equilibrium and the dynamics of potentialities for different species
to evolve towards increasingly higher complexity. It is based on the phenomenon
of ""fractal evolution"" which has been shown to constitute a fundamental
property of nonlinear discretized systems with one memory- or random-based
feedback loop. The latter involves a basic ""cognitive"" function of each species
given by the power of distinction of states within some predefined resolution.
The introduction of a realistic background noise limiting the range of the
feedback operation yields a pattern signature in fitness space with a
distribution of temporal boost/mutation distances according to a randomized
devil's staircase function. Introducing a further level in the hierarchy of the
system's rules, the possibility of an adaptive evolutionary change of the
resolution itself is implemented, thereby providing a time-dependent measure of
the species' cognitive abilities: an additional feedback loop makes use of the
inevitable intrinsic fluctuations within the fitness landscape to direct the
temporal change of the resolution. Feeding back the small adaptive changes of
resolution into the essentially directionless variations of the patterns'
lifetimes in fitness space effectively leads to a clear tendency towards
increasing evolution potentials for each species (""hierarchically emergent
fractal evolution"").

ability to perform single-qubit operations that are controlled by classical

operations correspond to pre-determined combinations of phase corrections and
bit-flips that are applied to the post-selected output modes of
non-deterministic quantum logic devices. Corrections of this kind are required
in order to obtain the correct logical output for certain detection events, and
their use can increase the overall success probability of the devices. In this
paper, we report on the experimental demonstration of the use of this type of
feed-forward system to increase the probability of success of a simple
non-deterministic quantum logic operation from approximately 1/4 to 1/2. This
logic operation involves the use of one target qubit and one ancilla qubit
which, in this experiment, are derived from a parametric down-conversion photon
pair. Classical information describing the detection of the ancilla photon is
fed-forward in real-time and used to alter the quantum state of the output
