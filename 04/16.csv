Tycho-2, and Starnet; the faint end by matching to USNO-A and 2MASS. In this
first paper, we detail the bright-end matching procedure. We show that for the
majority of stars in his catalog, Luyten measured positions accurate to 1"" even
though he recorded his results much more coarsely. However, there is a long
tail of position errors, with one error as large as 11 deg. Proper-motion
errors for the stars with small position errors are 24 mas/yr (1 sigma) but
deteriorate to 34 mas/yr for stars with inferior positions. NLTT is virtually
100% complete for V<11.5 and |b|>15 deg, but completeness in this magnitude
range falls to about 75% at the Galactic plane. Incompleteness near the plane
is not uniform, but is rather concentrated in the interval -80<l<20, where the

The temporal analysis of our early data indicates a steep decay, independent of
wavelength with power-law index alpha=-1.72+/-0.05. There is no evidence for a
break in the light curve earlier than 2.5 days after the burst. The spectral
energy distribution determined from the early broad-band photometry is a
power-law with index beta=-0.66+/-0.13 after correcting for a large reddening.
Spectra, obtained with the Magellan 6.5m Baade telescope, reveal narrow
emission lines from the host galaxy which provide a redshift of z=0.362+/-0.001
to the GRB. We also present late R and J-band observations of the afterglow
between 7-17 days after the burst. The late-time photometry shows a large
deviation from the initial decline and our data combined with Hubble Space
Telescope photometry provide strong evidence for a supernova peaking about 12
rest-frame days after the GRB. The first spectrum ever obtained of a GRB
supernova at cosmological distance revealed a blue continuum. SN 2001ke was
more blue near maximum than SN 1998bw and faded more quickly which demonstrates
that a range of properties are possible in supernovae which generate GRB. The
blue color is consistent with a supernova interacting with circumstellar gas
and this progenitor wind is also evident in the optical afterglow. This is the
best evidence to date that classical, long gamma-ray bursts are generated by
core-collapse supernovae.

appears in the light curve of Q0957+561A, its twin event (a similar feature) is
seen in the brightness record of Q0957+561B, and thus, one can measure the
corresponding time delay. The TO dataset includes two prominent twin events,
which were detected with a time separation of 425 +/- 4 days. On the other
hand, from the APO dataset, we found a clear evidence for two different time
delays associated with two pairs of twin events: 417.0 +/- 0.6 (APO main twin
events) and 432.0 +/- 1.9 days (APO secondary twin events), where the
APO(main)-APO(secondary) difference delay is of - 15 +/- 2 days. In agreement
with the Yonehara's idea, if the three pairs of twin events are originated
inside a standard hybrid source (accretion disk and circumnuclear stellar
region), the three measured time delays indicate that they do not come from a
common zone in the source. Therefore, we can consider that the prominent
features are caused by flares in a standard hybrid source and discuss on the
size and nature of the region of flares. In this paper it is showed that the
more plausible interpretation is that two of the three flares are generated at
distances (from the central black hole) larger than 90 pc. Some stellar
scenarios can explain the two flares far away from the black hole, while

resulting from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, this requires a higher
normalization for the matter power spectrum than measured by other means. In
addition to a local red-shift contribution, another strong possibility for
anisotropies at very small scales involve non-standard aspects of inflationary
models. To distinguish between contributions from early universe and local
structures, including a potential point source contribution, and to understand
the extent to which structures at low red-shifts contribute to small scale

involving CMB and the large scale structure. We suggest a cross-correlation of

hole. In such a system, the hole is magnetically coupled to the inflowing gas
and exerts a torque onto the accretion flow. A hot settling flow can form
around the hole and transport the angular momentum outward, to the outer edge
of the flow. Unlike other hot flows, such as advection- and
convection-dominated flows and inflow-outflow solutions (ADAFs, CDAFs, and
ADIOS), the properties of the hot settling flow are determined by the spin of
the central black hole, but are insensitive to the mass accretion rate.
Therefore, it may be possible to identify rapidly spinning BHs simply from
their broad-band spectra.
  Observationally, the hot settling flow around a Kerr hole is somewhat similar
to other hot flows in that they all have hard, power-law spectra and relatively
low luminosities. Thus, most black hole candidates in the low/hard and,
perhaps, intermediate X-ray state may potentially accrete via the hot settling
flow. However, a settling flow will be somewhat more luminous than
ADAFs/CDAFs/ADIOS, will exhibit high variability in X-rays, and may have
relativistic jets. This suggests that galactic microquasars and active galactic
nuclei may be powered by hot settling flows. We identify several galactic X-ray
sources as the best candidates.

has an important effect on radiative transfer under such conditions. We compare
analytical and numerical results in the specific case of a plane-parallel

neutral gas. At higher energies, an Fe Ka emission line is detected in PKS

widths of the lines are consistent, albeit within large uncertainties, with the
values for radio-quiet AGN of comparable X-ray luminosity. The Fe Ka line is
unresolved in 4C 74.26. In the case of PKS 2349-01, however, the inferred
properties of the line depend on the model adopted for the continuum: if a
simple power-law model is used, the line is resolved at more than 99%
confidence with a full width at half maximum corresponding to approximately
50,000 km/s and a rest-frame equivalent width of 230 +/- 120 eV, but if a

weaker, for an assumed full width at half maximum of 50,000 km/s. In 4C 74.26,

the scattering medium subtends a solid angle of 2pi to the illuminating source.

consideration, if the total jet energy is kept constant as suggested by recent
studies. The relative beaming factor b_rel, i.e., the ratio of all afterglow
rate including orphans to those associated with observable prompt GRBs, could
be as high as b_rel >~ 100 for searches deeper than R ~ 24, depending on
afterglow parameters. To make the most plausible predictions, we average the
model emission for ten sets of afterglow parameters obtained through fits to
ten well-observed, collimated GRB jets, weighted by the sky coverage of each
jet. Our model expectations are consistent with the results (or constraints)
obtained by all past searches. We estimate the number of orphan afterglows in
the first 1500deg^2 field of the SDSS to be about 0.2. The relative beaming
factor b_rel is rapidly increasing with the search sensitivity: b_rel ~ 3 for
the SDSS sensitivity to transient objects in the northern sky (R ~ 19), ~14 for
the past high-z supernova searches (R ~ 23), and ~50 for the sensitivity of the

considerable brightening on the sunward limb. The morphology agrees well with
that expected from fluorescent scattering of solar X-rays in the planetary
atmosphere. The radiation is observed at discrete energies, mainly at the
O-K_alpha energy of 0.53 keV. Fluorescence radiation is also detected from
C-K_alpha at 0.28 keV and, marginally, from N-K_alpha at 0.40 keV. An
additional emission line is indicated at 0.29 keV, which might be the signature
of the C 1s --> pi* transition in CO2 and CO. Evidence for temporal variability
of the X-ray flux was found at the 2.6 sigma level, with fluctuations by
factors of a few times indicated on time scales of minutes. All these findings
are fully consistent with fluorescent scattering of solar X-rays. No other
source of X-ray emission was detected, in particular none from charge exchange

nonparametric multivariate even-by-event analyses have been performed specified

  Solids, A Volume in Honour of Franco Bassani""",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.str-el",,"  In two-dimensional systems possessing a high degree of symmetry, the
repulsive electron-electron interaction produces a pairing force; the mechanism
would fail in the presence of strong distortions. We have studied this in the
one-band and three-band Hubbard Model. From partially occupied orbitals one
obtains pair eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with no on-site repulsion (the W=0
pairs). The concept of W=0 pairs allows to make qualitative and quantitative
predictions about the behaviour of interacting many-body systems, a quite
remarkable and unusual situation. Exact numerical solutions for clusters with
``magic'' hole numbers reveal attraction between the holes in W=0 pairs. The
effect occurs in all fully symmetric clusters which are centered on a Cu site;
then holes get paired in a wide, physically relevant parameter range and show
superconducting quantization of the magnetic flux. A canonical transformation
of the Hamiltonian, valid for clusters and for the full plane, leads to a
Cooper-like equation for the W=0 pairs. We have evaluated the effective
interaction and found that W=0 pairs are the bare quasiparticles which, once
dressed, become two-hole bound states. We applied the above theory to the doped
antiferromagnet, and found that the ground state at half filling is the singlet
component of a determinantal state. We write down this determinant and the
ground state wave function explicitly in terms of a many-body W=0 eigenstate.
Our analytical results for the $4\times 4$ square lattice at half filling and
with doped holes, compared to available numerical data, demonstrate that the
method, besides providing intuitive grasp on pairing, also has quantitative
predictive power.

Cosolvent exclusion favors overlap of polymers, mimicking the effect of a poor
solvent by inducing an effective attraction between polymers. For this model, a
geometry-based density functional theory is derived and applied to bulk fluid
phase behavior. With increasing cosolvent concentration (worsening solvent
quality), the predicted colloid-polymer binodal shifts to lower colloid
concentrations, promoting demixing. For sufficiently poor solvent, a reentrant

related to the crossing by the Fermi level of the edges of the pseudogap due to
antiferromagnetic short range order (bonding edge for holes doping, antibonding
one for electrons doping). The symmetry of the superconductive gap can be
related to the Bragg scattering of electronic Bloch states near the edges of
the AF pseudogap. Assuming a standard phonon coupling, one then predicts for
commensurate AF a pure d symmetry of the superconductive gap for underdoped
samples and d symmetry plus an ip contribution increasing linearly with
overdoping. This seems in agreement with recent measurements of gap symmetry
for YBCO, but should be more fully tested, especially for electron doped

charge density can be defined. It is checked, on the solvable models, that this
correlation function does have the generic long-range behaviour, decaying as
the inverse square distance, predicted by macroscopic electrostatics. In the
case of a two-component plasma (Coulomb fluid made of two species of particles
of opposite charges), the density correlation function on the boundary circle
itself is conjectured to have a temperature-independent behaviour, decaying as
the -4 power of the distance.

indices, (100), (011) and (300), and along transverse and diagonal directions
only. No diffuse scattering is found in longitudinal scans. The diffuse
scattering peaks can be fitted well with a Lorentzian function, from which a
correlation length is extracted. The correlation length increases with
decreasing temperatures down to the transition at Tc, first following a
Curie-Weiss law, then departing from it and becoming flat at very low
temperatures. These results are interpreted in terms of three temperature
regions: 1) dynamic polarization fluctuations (i.e. with a finite lifetime) at
high temperatures, 2) static polarization reorientations (condensation of polar
nanoregions) that can still reorient as a unit (relaxor behavior) at
intermediate temperatures and 3) orientational freezing of the polar
nanoregions with random strain fields in pure PZN or a structural phase
transition in PZN-xPT at low temperatures. The addition of PT leads to a
broadening of the diffuse scattering along the diagonal ([111]) relative to the
transverse ([100]) direction, indicating a change in the orientation of the
polar regions. Also, with the addition of PT, the polar nanoregions condense at
a higher temperature above Tc.

the relation between the complexity level constraint on a model class and the

dark matter narrowly determines m_0 in terms of m_{1/2} (for fixed value of
tanbeta and A_0) due to co-annihilation effects. Additional new data could fix
the parameters further. Thus the parameter space is sensitive to the muon
magnetic moment anomaly, \delta a_\mu, and if \delta a_\mu lies 1 \sigma above
its current central value, it would exclude mSUGRA, while if it lies 1\sigma
below (but is still positive) it pushes the SUSY spectrum into the TeV domain.

branching ratio sensitivity of Br[B_s ->\mu^+ \mu^-] > 6.5\times10^{-9} with 15

determine the mSUGRA parameters for \mu > 0. Detector cross sections are then
within the range of planned future dark matter experiments. Non-universal

$S(\tau)$. In this mirage cosmology approach, there is no self-gravity on the

fact that the non-BPS brane eventually decays on a time-scale much larger than

sine Gordon, discrete $\phi^4$ and discrete nonlinear Schr\""odinger. The
solutions we consider are periodic oscillations on a kink or standing wave
breather background. The origin of these oscillations is the presence of
internal modes, associated with the static ground state. Some of these modes
are associated with the breaking of translational invariance, in going from a
spatially continuous to a spatially discrete system. Others are associated with
discrete modes which bifurcate from the continuous spectrum. It is also
possible that such modes exist in the continuum limit and persist in the
discrete case. The regimes of existence, stability and metastability of states
as the lattice spacing is varied are investigated analytically and numerically.
A consequence of our analysis is a class of spatially localized, time
quasiperiodic solutions of the discrete nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. We
demonstrate, however, that this class of quasiperiodic solution is rather
special and that its natural generalizations yield only metastable
quasiperiodic solutions.

nucleon-nucleon potential models were constructed by supplementing the basic

ensured that the combination led to NN scattering phase shifts in excellent

nuclear matter g-matrices have been formed and with each of those relativistic
full-folding optical potentials for nucleon-nucleus elastic scattering
determined. Application to such scattering for projectile energies to 1.5 GeV

We develop a master equation for the dynamics of the system subject to

of the transfer process to stochastic pulse shape errors for a number of
different pulse shapes. We show that under certain conditions, the sensitivity
of the transfer to the noise depends on the pulse shape, and develop a method
for determining a pulse shape that is minimally sensitive to specific errors.

that the maximum speedup of quantum search in the generalized Hamiltonian is

violate the proof of Zalka that the quadratic speedup is optimal in quantum
search. However the argurment of Giovannetti et al. that a quantum speedup
comes from the interaction between subsystems(or, equivalently entanglement)
(and is concerned with the Margolus and Levitin theorem) supports our result.

knowledge or information (""bit""): (1) it is usually defined on a space of
classical configurations, (2) its generic entanglement is, therefore, analogous
to statistical correlations, and (3) it determines probabilities of measurement
outcomes. Nonetheless, quantum superpositions (such as represented by a wave
function) define individual physical states (""it""). This conceptual dilemma may
have its origin in the conventional operational foundation of physical
concepts, successful in classical physics, but inappropriate in quantum theory
because of the existence of mutually exclusive operations (used for the
definition of concepts). In contrast, a hypothetical realism, based on concepts
that are justified only by their universal and consistent applicability, favors
the wave function as a description of (thus nonlocal) physical reality. The
(conceptually local) classical world then appears as an illusion, facilitated
by the phenomenon of decoherence, which is consistently explained by the very
entanglement that must dynamically arise in a universal wave function.

It is shown that the independence of the continuum hypothesis determines status
and properties of the set of intermediate cardinality. The intermediate set is
a hierarchy of non-equivalent infinite sets. Its description consist of
autonomous theories. In particular, quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, and
geometrical optics should be regarded as components of the complete description
of the intermediate set. The intermediate sets may be produced as a result of a
fission of a continuous interval. The simplest schemes of the fission are
considered. Some analogy with the Standard Model is pointed out.

in terms of the operator-valued dynamic structure factor, a two-point
correlation function which compactly takes the statistical mechanics properties
of the macrosystem into account. For the case of a free quantum gas the dynamic
structure factor can be exactly calculated and in the long wavelength limit a
Fokker-Planck equation for the description of quantum dissipation and in
particular quantum Brownian motion is obtained, where peculiar corrections due
to quantum statistics can be put into evidence.
