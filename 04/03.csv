Hamiltonian model which includes resonant terms from both types of
perturbations and is similar to the forced pendulum. Via numerical integration
of this model we construct Poincare maps to illustrate the nature and stability
of the phase space. We find that resonance overlap is most likely to cause
widespread chaos when the pattern of the spiral structure puts the solar
neighborhood near the 2:1 inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) in the case of a
2-armed pattern, or near the 4:1 ILR in the case of a 4-armed pattern. When
this happens both the quasiperiodic orbits which support the spiral structure
and those that oscillate with the bar are disrupted near the bar's 2:1 outer
Lindblad resonance (OLR). Consequently the pattern speed of spiral structure
which passes through the OLR must be faster than 0.45 times the solar
neighborhood angular rotation rate if it is 2-armed or faster than 0.75 times
this value if it is 4-armed. Alternatively the OLR may form a boundary between
spiral modes at different pattern speeds. In all cases we find that spiral
structure is disrupted by the OLR over a narrow range of radius and the extent
of the orbits aligned perpendicular to the bar at the OLR is limited by the
spiral perturbations.

revealed several distant clusters of galaxies and a number of possible Galactic

hierarchically clumped from a variety of observations (molecules, H I,

the radial optical depth of the sphere averaged over all directions, and random
distributions of the dust within the sphere. The outputs are the stellar
extinction, optical depth, and flux of scattered light as seen from various
viewing angles. Observations provide the extinction and scattered flux from a
particular direction.
  Hierarchical geometry has a large effect on the flux of scattered light
emerging from a nebula for a particular extinction of the exciting star. There
is a very large spread in both scattered fluxes and extinctions for any
distribution of dust. Consequently, an observed stellar extinction and
scattered flux can be fitted by a wide range of albedos. With hierarchical
geometry it is not completely safe to determine even relative optical constants
from multiwavelength observations of the same reflection nebula. The geometry
effectively changes with wavelength as the opacity of the clumps varies. Limits
on the implications of observing the same object in various wavelengths are
discussed briefly.
  Henry (2002) uses a recipe to determine the scattered flux from a star with a
given extinction. It is claimed to be independent of the geometry. It provides
considerably more scattering than our models, probably leading to an

additional evidence that Lyman-break galaxies can be considered as scaled-up
local starbursts and that the locally derived starburst UV reddening relation
may be a reasonable tool for estimating the UV extinction at high redshift. Our
analysis shows that the Lyman-break sample can not have far-IR to far-UV flux
ratios similar to nearby ULIGs, as this would predict a mean X-ray luminosity
100 times larger than observed, as well as far-IR luminosities large enough to
be detected in the sub-mm. We calculate the UV reddening expected from the
Calzetti effective starburst attenuation curve and the radiative transfer
models of Witt & Gordon for low metallicity dust in a shell geometry with
homogeneous or clumpy dust distributions and find that all are consistent with

stars to the optical depth and the lensing rate based on two different models
of the pulsar distribution in the galaxy. Since only a small fraction of all
neutron stars are pulsars, it is unlikely to find a pulsar that acts as a
microlense by chance. A position comparison of known radio pulsars with
observed microlensing candidates towards the galactic bulge and spiral arms

attenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. It is based on two stellar
absorption line indices, the 4000 Angstrom break strength and the Balmer
absorption line index Hdelta_A. Together, these indices allow us to constrain
the mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed in
bursts over the past few Gyr. A comparison with broad band photometry then
yields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. We generate a large
library of Monte Carlo realizations of different star formation histories,
including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. We use
this library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions,
dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios for
a sample of 122,208 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The
typical 95% confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +-40%. We study
how the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolute
magnitude, concentration index and photometric pass-band and how dust
attenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000 Angstrom break
strength. We also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present Universe
is distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration,
colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. We find that most of the
stellar mass in the local Universe resides in galaxies that have stellar masses
\~5\times 10^10 M_sol, half light radii ~3 kpc, and half- light surface mass
densities ~10^9 M_sol/kpc^2. The distribution of D(4000) is strongly bimodal,
showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populations
and galaxies with more recent star formation.

magnetic funnels of magnetospheric accretion models of young stars. We study
four different damping mechanisms of the Alfven waves: nonlinear, turbulent,
viscous-resistive and collisional. Two different possible origins for the
Alfven waves are discussed: 1) Alfven waves generated at the surface of the
star by the shock produced by the infalling matter; and 2) Alfven waves
generated locally in the funnel by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We find
that, in general, the damping lengths are smaller than the tube length. Since
thermal conduction in the tube is not efficient, Alfven waves generated only at
the star's surface cannot heat the tube to the temperatures necessary to fit
the observations. Only for very low frequency Alfven waves ~10^{-5} the ion
cyclotron frequency, is the viscous-resistive damping length greater than the
tube length. In this case, the Alfven waves produced at the surface of the star
are able to heat the whole tube. Otherwise, local production of Alfven waves is
required to explain the observations. The turbulence level is calculated for
different frequencies for optically thin and thick media. We find that
turbulent velocities varies greatly for different damping mechanisms, reaching
\~100 km s^{-1} for the collisional damping of small frequency waves.

keV X-ray spectrum of the bright nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. We first
utilize the large bandpass and medium spectral resolution afforded by BeppoSAX
data to construct a 1-100 keV spectral template, which assumes the absorption
arises in both warm (i.e. partially photoionized) and cold gas present in the
line of sight to the active nucleus of the source. Application of this spectral
model to an ASCA ""long-look"" observation of NGC 4151 reveals a partial
correlation between the underlying continuum flux and the ionization state of
the warm absorber. Such a correlation is an intrinsic property of a warm
absorber and argues strongly in favour of this interpretation for the complex
absorbing column over alternative partial covering models. The inferred
relatively low density for the warm gas, implies an equilibration timescale for
the dominant ions of the same order or longer than the timescale of the
continuum variability. It follows that the warm component will invariably be
observed in a non-equilibrium ionization state.
  We also find that (i) the reported hardening of the spectrum of NGC 4151 as
the continuum level falls may be simply due to the presence of an underlying
(hard and relatively constant) Compton-reflection component and (ii) the iron
Ka line has a relatively narrow Gaussian profile and a line flux that remains
constant over both short (days) and long (months to years) timescales - a
relativistically broadened iron Ka feature was not required in our modelling.

radiation, discovered by Penzias and Wilson in 1965 appears to present clearcut
evidence that the universe was uniform and in equilibrium at the decoupling
transition when a plasma of protons and electrons condensed into a gas of
Hydrogen. COBE indicates that only very small ripples of order 10^{-5} existed
at decoupling. Gravity then caused hydrogen to cluster and possibly reheat
parts of the universe to form the luminous matter that we observe today. We
suggest an alternative scenario, where a spatially intermittent structure of
extremely hot matter already existed in an otherwise uniform plasma state at
the decoupling transition. The plasma was not in equilibrium but in a very high
Reynolds number turbulent state. The sparse bursts would not affect the
uniformity of the CMB radiation. Luminous matter originates from localized hot
bursts already present in the plasma state prior to decoupling. No reheating,
and no exotic matter is needed to get luminous matter.

neutral gas (HI+H2) and implies a global gas-to-dust ratio of 90. There is no
significant radial variation of this ratio: this can be understood, since the
gas content is dominated by far by the molecular gas. The latter is estimated
through the CO emission tracer, which is itself dependent on metallicity,
similarly to dust emission. By comparing the radial profile of our visual
optical depth map with that of the SCUBA image, we infer an emissivity (dust
absorption coefficient) at 850\mum that is 3 times lower than the value
measured by COBE in the Milky Way, and 9 times lower than in NGC 891. A

Random Matrix Models which show some interesting behaviour. First we consider
matrix models with gaps in there spectrum or density of eigenvalues. The
density-density correlators of these models depend on whether N, where N is the
size of the matrix, takes even or odd values. The fact that this dependence
persists in the large N thermodynamic limit is an unusual property and may have
consequences in the study of one electron effects in mesoscopic systems.
Secondly, we study the parametric and cross correlators of the Harish
Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber matrix model. The analytic expressions determine how the
correlators change as a parameter (e.g. the strength of a perturbation in the
hamiltonian of the chaotic system or external magnetic field on a sample of
material) is varied. The results are relevant for the conductance fluctuations
in disordered mesoscopic systems.

these generalized models the range of the hard-core interactions are changed

The models probing these effects are those of biased diffusion of particles
having size S=0,1,2,..., or an effective negative ""size"" S=-1,-2,..., in units
of lattice space. Our numerical simulations show that irrespective of the range
of the hard-core potential, as long some relative ordering of particles are
kept, we find suitable sliding-tag correlation functions whose fluctuations
growth with time anomalously slow ($t^{{1/3}}$), when compared with the normal
diffusive behavior ($t^{{1/2}}$). These results indicate that the critical
behavior of these stochastic models are in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
universality class. Moreover a previous Bethe-ansatz calculation of the
dynamical critical exponent $z$, for size $S \geq 0$ particles is extended to
the case $S<0$ and the KPZ result $z=3/2$ is predicted for all values of $S \in

  Symposium lecture, and book chapter for Wheeler Festschrift; submitted to PRD",,,,"gr-qc",,"  Superconductors will be considered as macroscopic quantum gravitational
antennas and transducers, which can directly convert upon reflection a beam of
quadrupolar electromagnetic radiation into gravitational radiation, and vice
versa, and thus serve as practical laboratory sources and receivers of
microwave and other radio-frequency gravitational waves. An estimate of the
transducer conversion efficiency on the order of unity comes out of the
Ginzburg-Landau theory for an extreme type II, dissipationless superconductor
with minimal coupling to weak gravitational and electromagnetic radiation
fields, whose frequency is smaller than the BCS gap frequency, thus satisfying
the quantum adiabatic theorem. The concept of ``the impedance of free space for
gravitational plane waves'' is introduced, and leads to a natural
impedance-matching process, in which the two kinds of radiation fields are
impedance-matched to each other around a hundred coherence lengths beneath the
surface of the superconductor. A simple, Hertz-like experiment has been
performed to test these ideas, and preliminary results will be reported. (PACS

spacetime. On noncommutative (NC) spacetime, this divergence will generally
induce pole-like infrared (IR) singularities in external momenta through the
UV/IR mixing. In spontaneous symmetry breaking theory this would invalidate the
Goldstone theorem which is the basis for mass generation when symmetry is
gauged. We examine this issue at two loop level in the U(N) linear sigma model
which is known to be free of such IR singularities in the Goldstone
self-energies at one loop. We analyze the structures in the NC parameter
(\theta_{\mu\nu}) dependence in two loop integrands of Goldstone self-energies.
We find that their coefficients are effectively once subtracted at the external
momentum p=0 due to symmetry relations between 1PI and tadpole contributions,
leaving a final result proportional to a quadratic form in p. We then compute
the leading IR terms induced by NC to be of order p^2\ln(\theta_{\mu\nu})^2 and
p^2\ln\tilde{p}^2 (\tilde{p}_{\mu}=\theta_{\mu\nu}p^{\nu}) which are much
milder than naively expected without considering the above cancellation. The
Goldstone bosons thus keep massless and the theorem holds true at this level.
However, the limit of \theta\to 0 cannot be smooth any longer as it is in the
one loop Goldstone self-energies, and this nonsmooth behaviour is not
necessarily associated with the IR limit of the external momentum as we see in
the term of p^2\ln(\theta_{\mu\nu})^2.

explore the local nature of the PT field by means of the wavelet transform
method. The primary indication is that an initially smooth PT field becomes
rough (within specified scales), though in a qualitatively sparse fashion.
Similarly, initially 1D iso-PT contours (i.e., PT level sets) are seen to
acquire a fractal nature. Moreover, the dimensions of the iso-PT contours
satisfy existing analytical bounds. The expectation that the roughness will
manifest itself in the singular nature of the gradient fields is confirmed via
the multifractal nature of the dissipation field. Following earlier work on the
subject, the singular and oscillatory nature of the gradient field is
investigated by examining the scaling of a probability measure and a sign
singular measure respectively. A physically motivated derivation of the
relations between the variety of scaling exponents is presented, the aim being
to bring out some of the underlying assumptions which seem to have gone
unnoticed in previous presentations. Apart from concentrating on specific
properties of the SQG system, a broader theme of the paper is a comparison of

dipole alignment in supercooled water and heavy water before and after the
onset of freezing. Voltage signals as high as 13 mV have been recorded. In some
cases up to 3 seconds before latent heat is released and freezing began. The
polarity of the voltage signals is suggestive of molecule dipole alignment
prior to freezing.

absorption, and study propagation of a single photon from an emitting atom to a
detector atom both with and without an intervening scatterer. We find an exact
quantum analog to the classical complex analytic signal of an electromagnetic
wave scattered by a medium of charged oscillators. This quantum signal exhibits
classical phase delays. We define a time of detection which, in the appropriate
limits, exactly matches the predictions of a classically defined delay for
light propagating through a medium of charged oscillators. The fully quantized
model provides a simple, unambiguous, and causal interpretation of delays that
seemingly imply speeds greater than c in the region of anomalous dispersion.

his framework to a quantum optimization problem using polynomial-time quantum
computations and introduces the notion of an ``universal'' quantum optimization
problem similar to a classical ``complete'' optimization problem. We exhibit a
canonical quantum optimization problem that is universal for the class of
polynomial-time quantum optimization problems. We show in a certain relativized
world that all quantum optimization problems cannot be approximated closely by
quantum polynomial-time computations. We also study the complexity of quantum
optimization problems in connection to well-known complexity classes.

for a device that is designed to teleport coherent states. This entanglement
fidelity is universal, in that the calculation is independent of the use of
entangled coherent states and applies generally to the teleportation of
entanglement using coherent states. The average fidelity is shown to be a poor
indicator of the capability of teleporting entanglement; i.e., very high
average fidelity for the quantum teleportation apparatus can still result in
low entanglement fidelity for one mode of the two-mode entangled coherent
state.

now standing at the level of large molecules. Experiments in materials science
on the other hand have come down to ever smaller sizes largely due to the
success of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM), which allows studying
single molecules on surfaces. Since both fields coming from opposite side of
the size spectrum are now meeting, there is a need of consistent theories. The
simulations presented in the article, which we are referring to, are not
consistent with molecular dynamics simulations which are routinely used to
interpret STM results. Our comment points this out in detail.
