1915+105 and GRO J1655-40 may produce small but measurable contributions to the
cosmic ray (CR) spectrum. If these jets contain cold protons and heavy ions (as
in SS433), it is plausible that this component will consist of a narrow
spectral feature, with a mean particle energy corresponding roughly to the bulk
kinetic particle energy in the beam, Gamma_jet m c^2, which, based on current
estimates of Gamma_jet, falls into the range of 3-10 GeV. The presence of
several sources with different Gamma_jet will lead to superposition of several
such peaks. Additionally, diffusive particle acceleration should produce a
powerlaw whose low energy cutoff at or above Gamma_jet^2 m c^2 would be visible
as another spectral feature. The large metallicities measured in several
microquasar companions suggest that this CR component could have an anomalous
composition compared to the bulk Galactic CRs. We provide estimates of the
effects of adiabatic losses, which pose the greatest challenge to models of
narrow band CR production in microquasar jets. While the total energy contained
in the microquasar CR component is highly uncertain, the CR spectrum in the
vicinity of microquasars would be severely affected. AMS02 will be able to
probe the low energy CR spectrum for such components and composition anomalies.
The spectrally peculiar gamma-ray emission produced by interaction of the ISM
with CRs surrounding microquasars might be detectable by GLAST. If the presence
of a microquasar CR proton component can be ruled out observationally, this
argument could be turned around in favor of electron-positron jets. We show
that existing OSSE/GRO and future INTEGRAL data on the Galactic 511 keV line
flux put interesting constraints on the particle content of microquasar jets.

end of the November 2000 outburst of the neutron star (NS) transient Aql X-1.
Over the five month span in quiescence, the X-ray spectra are consistent with
thermal emission from a NS with a pure hydrogen photosphere and
R_{\infty}=15.9+{0.8}-{2.9} (d/5 kpc) km at the optically implied X-ray column
density. We also detect a hard power-law tail during two of the four
observations. The intensity of Aql X-1 first decreased by 50+/-4% over three
months, then increased by 35+/-5% in one month, and then remained constant (<6%
change) over the last month. These variations in the first two observations
cannot be explained by a change in the power-law spectral component, nor in the
X-ray column density. Presuming that R_{\infty} is not variable and a pure
hydrogen atmosphere, the long-term changes can only be explained by variations
in the NS effective temperature, from kT_{eff, \infty}=130+3-5 eV, down to
113+3-4 eV, finally increasing to 118+9-4 eV for the final two observations.
During one of these observations, we observe two phenomena which were
previously suggested as indicators of quiescent accretion onto the NS:
short-timescale (<1e4 sec) variability (at 32+8-6% rms), and a possible
absorption feature near 0.5 keV. The possible absorption feature can
potentially be explained as due to a time-variable response in the ACIS
detector. Even so, such a feature has not been detected previously from a NS,
and if confirmed and identified, can be exploited for simultaneous measurements
of the photospheric redshift and NS radius.

are found to have disc orbits which tend to have apsidal lines antialigned with
respect to those of the inner protoplanets. Other modes corresponding to free
disc modes may be global over a large range of length scales and accordingly be
long lived. We consider the motion of a protoplanet in the earth mass range
embedded in an eccentric disc and determine the equilibrium orbits which
maintain fixed apsidal alignment with respect to the disc gas orbits.
Equilibrium eccentricities are found to be comparable or possibly exceed the
disc eccentricity. We then approximately calculate the tidal interaction with
the disc in order to estimate the orbital migration rate. Results are found to
deviate from the case of axisymmetric disc with near circular protoplanet orbit
once eccentricities of protoplanet and disc orbits become comparable to the
disc aspect ratio in magnitude. Aligned protoplanet orbits with very similar
eccentricity to that of the gas disc are found to undergo litle eccentricity
change while undergoing inward migration in general. However, for significantly
larger orbital eccentricities, migration may be significantly reduced or even
reverse from inwards to outwards. Thus the existence of global non circular
motions in discs with radial excursions comparable to the semi-thickness may
have important consequences for the migration and survival of protoplanetary
cores in the earth mass range.

radiation from the central source to the surface brightness of the intracluster
gas dominated by thermal emission. We show that resonance X-ray lines present
an advantage over the adjacent continuum, because the relative contribution of
the scattered component is typically larger in the line case by a significant
factor of 3-10. As an example, we estimate the level of constraint that could
be derived from future fine spectroscopic observations on the past X-ray
luminosity of the nearby M87 and Cygnus A active galaxies. For instance,
scattered line radiation should be detectable from the Virgo cluster if the
X-ray luminosity of M87 was a few times 10^44 erg s^-1, or 10^-3 of its
Eddington luminosity, until a few times 10^5 years ago. For comparison, upper
limits inferred from the available XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray continuum data
are typically 1-2 orders of magnitude weaker. The same method can be applied to
distant powerful quasars (at redshifts z~1 if they have cluster-like gaseous
coronae, as suggested by Rosat and Chandra observations of active galaxies at

afterglows. We show that for reasonable limiting magnitudes ($m_{lim}=25$)
orphan afterglows would typically be detected from small ($\sim 10^\circ$)
angles away from the GRB jet axis. A detected orphan afterglow would generally
correspond to a ""near-miss"" of the GRB whose jet was pointing just slightly

C II, Si II, and Si III absorption lines in the Lya absorber at z = 0.00530.
Previous observations with FUSE have revealed Ly beta - Ly theta lines at this
redshift, thereby accurately constraining N(H I). We model the ionization of
the gas and derive [C/H] = -1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}, [Si/C] = 0.2+/-0.1, and log
n_{H} = -2.8+/-0.3. The model implies a small absorber thickness, ~70 pc, and
thermal pressure p/k ~ 40 cm^{-3} K. It is most likely that the absorber is
pressure confined by an external medium because gravitational confinement would
require a very high ratio of dark matter to baryonic matter. Based on Milky Way
sight lines in which carbon and silicon abundances have been reliably measured
in the same interstellar cloud (including new measurements presented herein),
we argue that the overabundance of Si relative to C is not due to dust
depletion. Instead, this probably indicates that the gas has been predominately
enriched by Type II supernovae. Such enrichment is most plausibly provided by
an unbound galactic wind, given the absence of galaxies within a projected
distance of 100 kpc and the presence of galaxies capable of driving a wind at
larger distances. We also constrain the metallicity and physical conditions of
the Virgo absorber at z = 0.00337 based on detections of O VI and H I and an
upper limit on C IV. If this absorber is collisionally ionized, the O VI/C IV
limit requires T > 10^{5.3} K. For either collisional ionization or

position, while the signed sums can be remarkably uniform inside the tangential
caustic in the absence of naked cusps. For a family of models in which the
potential is a power-law of the elliptic radius, the number of visible images
is found as a function of flattening, external shear and core radius. The
magnification of the central image depends on the core radius and the slope of
the potential. For typical source and lens redshifts, the missing central image
leads to strong constraints; the mass distribution in the lensing galaxy must
be nearly cusped, and the cusp must be isothermal or stronger. This is in
accord with the cuspy cores seen in high resolution photometry of nearby,
massive, early-type galaxies, which typically have the surface density falling
like distance^{-1.3} outside a break radius of a few hundred parsecs. Cuspy
cores by themselves can provide an explanation of the missing central images.
Dark matter at large radii may alter the slope of the projected density;
provided the slope remains isothermal or steeper and the break radius remains
small, then the central image remains unobservable. The sensitivity of the

stars to currently be resolved at X-ray energies. The 5 ksec Chandra HRC-I
image provides the first direct evidence for spatially extended X-ray emission
in an early-type binary system. The X-ray emission peaks close to the position
of the radio bow shock and north of the WN8 star. A deeper X-ray image is
needed to accurately determine the degree of spatial extension, to exactly
align the X-ray and optical/radio frames, and to determine whether part of the
detected X-ray emission arises in the individual stellar winds. Simulated X-ray
images of the wind-wind collision have a FWHM consistent with the data, and
maximum likelihood fits suggest that a deeper observation may also constrain
the inclination and wind momentum ratio of this system. However, as the WR wind
dominates the colliding wind X-ray emission it appears unlikely that the
mass-loss rate and the terminal velocity of the companion wind can be
separately determined from X-ray observations. We also note an inconsistency
between numerical and analytical estimates of the X-ray luminosity ratio of the
stronger and weaker wind components, and conclude that the analytical results
are in error.

Bruinsma and Aeppli argued in Physical Review Letters {\bf 48}, 1625 (1982),
using a $4-\epsilon$ renormalization-group calculation, that short-range
molecular herringbone correlations coupled to the hexatic ordering drive this
transition first order via thermal fluctuations, and that the critical behavior
observed in real systems is controlled by a `nearby' tricritical point. We have
revisited the model of Bruinsma and Aeppli and present here the results of our
study. We have found two nontrivial strongly-coupled herringbone-hexatic fixed
points apparently missed by those authors. Yet, those two new nontrivial
fixed-points are unstable, and we obtain the same final conclusion as the one
reached by Bruinsma and Aeppli, namely that of a fluctuation-driven first order
transition. We also discuss the effect of local two-fold distortion of the bond
order as a possible missing order parameter in the Hamiltonian.

relations, e.g., a verb selects as its subject a given nominal class. This
paper extends previous statistical models to class-to-class preferences, and
presents a model that learns selectional preferences for classes of verbs,
together with an algorithm to integrate the learned preferences in WordNet. The
theoretical motivation is twofold: different senses of a verb may have
different preferences, and classes of verbs may share preferences. On the
practical side, class-to-class selectional preferences can be learned from
untagged corpora (the same as word-to-class), they provide selectional
preferences for less frequent word senses via inheritance, and more important,
they allow for easy integration in WordNet. The model is trained on
subject-verb and object-verb relationships extracted from a small corpus
disambiguated with WordNet senses. Examples are provided illustrating that the
theoretical motivations are well founded, and showing that the approach is

It is shown that all possible configurations of a brane are invariant under an

brane with non-zero k are always G(D-2,K) invariant, except for those in five

are exchanged during the pinching process in terms of unphysical ghost Green's
functions; the latter appear in the standard Slavnov-Taylor identity satisfied
by the tree-level and one-loop three-gluon vertex. This identification allows
for the consistent generalization of the intrinsic pinch technique to two
loops, through the collective treatment of entire sets of diagrams, instead of
the laborious algebraic manipulation of individual graphs, and sets up the
stage for the generalization of the method to all orders. We show that the task
of comparing the effective Green's functions obtained by the Pinch Technique
with those computed in the background field method Feynman gauge is
significantly facilitated when employing the powerful quantization framework of
Batalin and Vilkovisky. This formalism allows for the derivation of a set of
useful non-linear identities, which express the Background Field Method Green's
functions in terms of the conventional (quantum) ones and auxiliary Green's
functions involving the background source and the gluonic anti-field; these

standard model with universal strength of Yukawa couplings. A salient feature
of these models is that the CP phases are constrained to be very small by the
hierarchy of the quark masses, and the pattern of CKM mixing angles. This leads
to a small amount of CP violation from the usual KM mechanism and a significant
contribution from supersymmetry is required. Due to the large generation mixing
in some of the supersymmetric interactions, the electric dipole moments impose
severe constraints on the parameter space, forcing the trilinear couplings to
be factorizable in matrix form. We find that the LL mass insertions give the
dominant gluino contribution to saturate epsilon_K. The chargino contributions
to epsilon'/epsilon are significant and can accommodate the experimental
results. In this framework, the standard model gives a negligible contribution
to the CP asymmetry in B-meson decay, a_{J/\psi K_s}. However, due to
supersymmetric contributions to B_d-\bar{B}_d mixing, the recent large value of
a_{J/\psi K_s} can be accommodated.

systems (bosons) at low density, $\rho$, can be examined experimentally it is
appropriate to revisit some of the formulas deduced by many authors 4-5 decades
ago. For systems with repulsive (i.e. positive) interaction potentials the
experimental low temperature state and the ground state are effectively
synonymous -- and this fact is used in all modeling. In such cases, the leading
term in the energy/particle is $2\pi\hbar^2 a \rho/m$ where $a$ is the
scattering length of the two-body potential. Owing to the delicate and peculiar
nature of bosonic correlations (such as the strange $N^{7/5}$ law for charged
bosons), four decades of research failed to establish this plausible formula
rigorously. The only previous lower bound for the energy was found by Dyson in
1957, but it was 14 times too small. The correct asymptotic formula has
recently been obtained by us and this work will be presented. The reason behind
the mathematical difficulties will be emphasized. A different formula,
postulated as late as 1971 by Schick, holds in two-dimensions and this, too,
will be shown to be correct. With the aid of the methodology developed to prove
the lower bound for the homogeneous gas, two other problems have been
successfully addressed. One is the proof by us that the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation correctly describes the ground state in the `traps' actually used in
the experiments. For this system it is also possible to prove complete Bose
condensation, as we have shown. Another topic is a proof that Foldy's 1961
theory of a high density Bose gas of charged particles correctly describes its
ground state energy.

field caused by an instability of their spatial distribution is suggested. The
reason for the clustering instability is a combined effect of the particles
inertia and a finite correlation time of the velocity field. The crucial
parameter for the clustering instability is a size of the particles. The
critical size is estimated for a strong clustering (with a finite fraction of
particles in clusters) associated with the growth of the mean absolute value of
the particles number density and for a weak clustering associated with the
growth of the second and higher moments. A new concept of compressibility of
the turbulent diffusion tensor caused by a finite correlation time of an
incompressible velocity field is introduced. In this model of the velocity
field, the field of Lagrangian trajectories is not divergence-free. A mechanism
of saturation of the clustering instability associated with the particles
collisions in the clusters is suggested. Applications of the analyzed effects
to the dynamics of droplets in the turbulent atmosphere are discussed. An
estimated nonlinear level of the saturation of the droplets number density in
clouds exceeds by the orders of magnitude their mean number density. The
critical size of cloud droplets required for clusters formation is more than
$20 \mu$m.

enable these characteristics. To address the issue of evolvability in designing
self-describing systems, this paper proposes a pattern-based, object-oriented,
description-driven architecture. The proposed architecture embodies four
pillars - first, the adoption of a multi-layered meta-modeling architecture and
reflective meta-level architecture, second, the identification of four data
modeling relationships that must be made explicit such that they can be
examined and modified dynamically, third, the identification of five design
patterns which have emerged from practice and have proved essential in
providing reusable building blocks for data management, and fourth, the
encoding of the structural properties of the five design patterns by means of
one pattern, the Graph pattern. In this paper the fundamentals of the
description-driven architecture are described - the multi-layered architecture
and reflective meta-level architecture, remaining detail can be found in the
cited references. A practical example of this architecture is described,
demonstrating the use of description-driven data objects in handling system
evolution.

basis states depends on coupling between different single particle basis states

necessary for occupation-number entanglement to appear. However, in order to
characterize quantum correlation caused by interaction, we use the eigenstates
of the single-particle Hamiltonian as the single particle basis upon which the
occupation-number entanglement is defined. Using the proper single particle
basis, we discuss occupation-number entanglement in important eigenstates,
especially ground states, of systems of many identical particles. The
discussions on Fermi systems start with Fermi gas, Hatree-Fock approximation,
and the electron-hole entanglement in excitations. The entanglement in a
quantum Hall state is quantified as -fln f-(1-f)ln(1-f), where f is the proper
fractional part of the filling factor. For BCS superconductivity, the
entanglement is a function of the relative momentum wavefunction of the Cooper
pair, and is thus directly related to the superconducting energy gap. For a
spinless Bose system, entanglement does not appear in the
Hatree-Gross-Pitaevskii approximation, but becomes important in the Bogoliubov
theory.
