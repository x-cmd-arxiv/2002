this velocity field as in the version of SPH called XSPH. The particles (fluid

alpha model we obtain a particle Lagrangian from which the SPH alpha equations
can be derived. The system satisfies a discrete Kelvin circulation theorem
identical to that obtained with no velocity averaging. In addition, the energy,
linear and angular momentum are conserved. We show that the continuum
equivalent of the SPH equations are identical to the continuum alpha model, and
we conjecture that they will have the same desirable features of the continuum
modelincluding the reduction of energy in the high wave number modes even when
the dissipation is zero. Regardless of issues concerning turbulence modelling,
the SPH alpha model is a powerful extension of the XSPH algorithm which reduces
disorder at short length scales and retains the constants of the motion. The

the resulting light curve can have significant deviations from the standard
form of a single lens event. The chance to produce significant deviations
becomes important when the separations between the component lenses are
equivalent to the combined angular Einstein ring radius of the system. For
multiple lens systems composed of more than two lenses, however, this condition
is difficult to meet because the orbits of such systems are unstable. Even if
events are caused by a multiple lens system with stable orbits where a pair of
lenses are closely located and the other component (third body) has a wide
separation from the pair, photometrically identifying the lens multiplicity
will be difficult because the event will be identified either by a binary lens
event caused by the close pair lenses or a single lens event caused by the
third body. In this paper, we show that if a seemingly binary lens event is
astrometrically followed up by using future high precision interferometers, the
existence of an additional third body can be identified via a repeating event.
We show that the signatures of third bodies can be unambiguously identified
from the characteristic distortions they make in the centroid shift
trajectories. We also show that due to the long range astrometric effect of
third bodies, the detection efficiency will be considerable even for third
bodies with large separations from their close lens pairs.

spectroscopy, which allowed the determination of spectral types to an accuracy
of about one-half class, for 60 stars. Synthetic photometry of spectral data
was performed in order to predict the expected UV emission, on the basis of the

The return to quiescence was punctuated by 12 small eruptions, of ~1 mag
amplitude and 2 day recurrence time; these ""echo outbursts"" are of uncertain
origin, but somewhat resemble the normal outbursts of dwarf novae. After 52
days, the star began a slow decline to quiescence.
  Periodic waves in the light curve closely followed the pattern seen in the
1978 superoutburst: a strong orbital signal dominated the first 12 days,
followed by a powerful /common superhump/ at 0.05721(5) d, 0.92(8)% longer than
P_orb. The latter endured for at least 90 days, although probably mutating into
a ""late"" superhump with a slightly longer mean period [0.05736(5) d]. The
superhump appeared to follow familiar rules for such phenomena in dwarf novae,
with components given by linear combinations of two basic frequencies: the
orbital frequency omega_o and an unseen low frequency Omega, believed to
represent the accretion disk's apsidal precession. Long time series reveal an
intricate fine structure, with ~20 incommensurate frequencies. Essentially all
components occurred at a frequency n(omega_o)-m(Omega), with m=1, ..., n. But
during its first week, the common superhump showed primary components at n
(omega_o)-Omega, for n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (i.e., m=1 consistently); a
month later, the dominant power shifted to components with m=n-1. This may
arise from a shift in the disk's spiral-arm pattern, likely to be the
underlying cause of superhumps.

putative 569 s orbital period. If this identification is correct, then it has
one of the shortest binary orbital periods known, and gravitational radiation
should drive the orbital evolution and mass transfer if the binary is
semi-detached. Here we report the results of a coherent timing study of the
archival ROSAT and ASCA data for RX J1914.4+2456. We performed a phase coherent
timing analysis using all five ROSAT observations spanning a 4.6 year period.
We demonstrate that all the data can be phase connected, and we show evidence
that the 1.756 mHz orbital frequency is increasing at a rate of 8 +- 3 e-18
Hz/s, consistent with the expected loss of angular momentum from the binary
system via gravitational radiation. In addition to providing evidence for the
emission of gravitational waves, our measurement of the orbital decay
constrains models for the X-ray emission and the nature of the secondary. If
stable mass accretion drives the X-ray flux, then orbital decay is inconsistent
with a degenerate donor. A helium burning dwarf is compatible if indeed such
systems can have periods as short as that of RX J1914.4+2456, an open
theoretical question. Our measurement is consistent with the unipolar induction
model of Wu et al. which does not require accretion to drive the X-ray flux. We
discuss how future timing measurements of RX J1914.4+2456 (and systems like it)
with for example, Chandra and XMM-Newton, can provide a unique probe of the
interaction between mass loss and gravitational radiation. We also discuss the
importance of such measurements in the context of gravitational wave detection
from space, such as is expected in the future with the LISA mission.

full two-dimensional coverage. The velocity and velocity dispersion fields
exhibit a large variety of morphologies: from simple rotating systems to
cylindrical, disky and triaxial velocity fields, bars and decoupled cores. Most
of these kinematical signatures do not have counterparts in the light
distribution. While some galaxies are consistent with axisymmetry, most are
more complex systems than assumed previously. This suggests that the
kinematical properties of nearby E/S0 galaxies do not agree with the often

does not happen. The passive random walkers in KPZ-type surface growth are
closely related to the shock waves in the noiseless Burgers equation. We also

detailed description of one particular Haskell-based model of functional
strategies. This model is characterised as follows. Firstly, we employ
first-class polymorphism as a form of second-order polymorphism as for the mere
types of functional strategies. Secondly, we use an encoding scheme of run-time
type case for mixing uniform and type-specific behaviour. Thirdly, we base all
traversal on a fundamental combinator for folding over constructor

parameterised style. We study two original forms of parameterisation. Firstly,
we design parameters for the specific control-flow, data-flow and traversal
characteristics of more concrete traversal schemes. Secondly, we use
overloading to postpone commitment to a specific type scheme of traversal. The
resulting portfolio of traversal schemes can be regarded as a challenging
benchmark for setups for typed generic programming.
  The way we develop the model and the suite of traversal schemes, it becomes
clear that parameterised + typed strategic programming is best viewed as a

crystal structures for the crystalline color superconducting phase of QCD, the
QCD incarnation of the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell phase. In this phase,
quarks of different flavor with differing Fermi momenta form Cooper pairs with
nonzero total momentum, yielding a condensate that varies in space like a sum
of plane waves. We work at zero temperature, as is relevant for compact star
physics. The Ginzburg-Landau approach predicts a strong first-order phase
transition (as a function of the chemical potential difference between quarks)
and for this reason is not under quantitative control. Nevertheless, by
organizing the comparison between different possible arrangements of plane
waves (i.e. different crystal structures) it provides considerable qualitative
insight into what makes a crystal structure favorable. Together, the
qualitative insights and the quantitative, but not controlled, calculations
make a compelling case that the favored pairing pattern yields a condensate
which is a sum of eight plane waves forming a face-centered cubic structure.
They also predict that the phase is quite robust, with gaps comparable in
magnitude to the BCS gap that would form if the Fermi momenta were degenerate.
These predictions may be tested in ultracold gases made of fermionic atoms. In
a QCD context, our results lay the foundation for a calculation of vortex
pinning in a crystalline color superconductor, and thus for the analysis of

precise determinations of these observables in near future experiments are
useful to distinguish the three models. We also investigate possible deviations
from the standard model predictions of CP asymmetries in other B decay modes.
In particular, a large deviation is possible for the U(2) model. The
consistency check of the unitarity triangle including $B\to
\pi\pi,\rho\pi,D^{(*)}K^{(*)},D^{(*)}\pi,D^{*}\rho$, and so on, at future high
luminosity $e^+e^-$ $B$ factories and hadronic $B$ experiments is therefore
important to distinguish flavor structures of different supersymmetric models.

extensive use of the Nielsen identities complemented by explicit calculations
we corroborate that the counter term for the CKM mixing matrix must be
explicitly gauge independent and demonstrate that the commonly used
prescription for the wave function renormalisation constants leads to gauge
parameter dependent amplitudes, even if the CKM counter term is gauge invariant
as required. We show that a proper LSZ-compliant prescription leads to gauge
independent amplitudes. The resulting wave function renormalisation constants
necessarily possess absorptive parts, but we verify that they comply with the
expected requirements concerning CP and CPT. The results obtained using this

amplitude) from the ones neglecting the absorptive parts in the case of top
decay. The difference is numerically relevant.

for the case of the large-N sigma model. In large-N gauge theories, the 1/N
expansion is tantamount to sorting the Feynman diagrams according to their
degree of planarity, that is, the minimal genus of the plane onto which the
diagram can be mapped without any crossings. This holds both for the usual
perturbative expansion with respect to powers of {tilde g}^2=g^2 N, as well as
for the expansion of lattice theories in positive powers of 1/{tilde g}^2. If
there were no renormalization effects, the tilde g expansion would have a
finite radius of convergence. The zero-dimensional theory can be used for
counting planar diagrams. It can be solved explicitly, so that the generating
function for the number of diagrams with given 3-vertices and 4-vertices, can
be derived exactly. This can be done for various kinds of Feynman diagrams. We
end with some remarks about planar renormalization.

Vol. 43 No. 9 pp. 4404-4444 (2002)","10.1063/1.1497184",,"quant-ph",,"  We study the visible compression of a source E of pure quantum signal states,
or, more formally, the minimal resources per signal required to represent
arbitrarily long strings of signals with arbitrarily high fidelity, when the
compressor is given the identity of the input state sequence as classical
information. According to the quantum source coding theorem, the optimal
quantum rate is the von Neumann entropy S(E) qubits per signal.
  We develop a refinement of this theorem in order to analyze the situation in
which the states are coded into classical and quantum bits that are quantified
separately. This leads to a trade--off curve Q(R), where Q(R) qubits per signal
is the optimal quantum rate for a given classical rate of R bits per signal.
  Our main result is an explicit characterization of this trade--off function
by a simple formula in terms of only single signal, perfect fidelity encodings
of the source. We give a thorough discussion of many further mathematical
properties of our formula, including an analysis of its behavior for group
covariant sources and a generalization to sources with continuously
parameterized states. We also show that our result leads to a number of
corollaries characterizing the trade--off between information gain and state
disturbance for quantum sources. In addition, we indicate how our techniques
also provide a solution to the so--called remote state preparation problem.
Finally, we develop a probability--free version of our main result which may be
interpreted as an answer to the question: ``How many classical bits does a
qubit cost?'' This theorem provides a type of dual to Holevo's theorem, insofar
as the latter characterizes the cost of coding classical bits into qubits.
