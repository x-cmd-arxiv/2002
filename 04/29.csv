structures concentric with the jet axis. To investigate the occurrence of such
features, we have used hydrodynamic simulations of jets with a range of Mach
numbers (from M=2 to 50) and densities (down to a ratio of 1E-4 relative to the
background) to generate ray-traced images simulating synchrotron emission from
the time-dependent shock structures. We compare these images with observations
of Hercules A, and consider the physical nature and temporal evolution of the
most plausible configurations. We find that the observed ring-like structures
are well explained as nearly annular shocks propagating in the backflow
surrounding the jet. We infer that the jet is oriented at between 30 and 70
degrees to the line of sight, consistent with radio depolarisation observations
of Gizani & Leahy. The observational lack of hot-spots at the extremities of
the radio lobes, and the possible presence of a buried hot-spot near the base
of the western lobe, are explained in terms of the intrinsic brightness
fluctuations and dynamics of the terminal shock of an ultra-light, low Mach
number jet that surges along its axis due to intermittent pinching and
obstruction by turbulent backflow in the cocoon. We conclude from the
appearance of both sides of the Hercules A, that both jets are on the
borderline of becoming fully turbulent.

typically about 14 hours. This implies that only this restricted portion of the
light curve need be intensively monitored for planets, a very significant
practical advantage. Nearly all planetary detections in high magnification
events will not involve caustic crossings. We discuss the issues involved in
determining the planetary parameters in high magnification microlensing events.
Earth mass planets may be detected with 1-m class telescopes if their projected
orbital radii lie within about 1.5 - 2.5 AU. Giant planets are detectable over
a much larger region. For multi-planet systems the perturbations due to
individual planets can be separated under certain conditions. The size of the
source star needs to be determined independently, but the presence of spots on
the source star is likely to be negligible, as is the effect of planetary
motion during an event.

interpreted in the context of a Low Inertia Accretor model, in which accretion
on to an equatorial belt of the white dwarf primary causes the belt to vary its
angular velocity. The rapid deceleration phase is attributed to propellering.
Evidence that temporary expulsion rather than accretion of gas occurs during
this phase is obtained from the large drop in EUV flux.
  We show that the QPOs are most probably caused by a vertical thickening of
the disc, moving as a travelling wave near the inner edge of the disc. This
alternately obscures and `reflects' radiation from the central source, and is
visible even in quite low inclination systems. A possible excitation mechanism,
caused by winding up and reconnection of magnetic field lines, is proposed.
  We apply the model, deduced largely from VW Hyi observations, to re-interpret
observations of SS Cyg, OY Car, UX UMa, V2051 Oph, V436 Cen and WZ Sge. In the
last of these we demonstrate the existence of a 742 s period in the light
curve, arising from obscuration by the travelling wave, and hence show that the
two principal oscillations are a DNO and its reprocessed companion.

find that, whereas it is possible that they were formed by purely astrophysical
processes, this is unlikely and most probably a populations of primordial
progenitors is necessary. We identify the mass distribution and comoving
density of this population and then propose a cosmological scenario producing
PBHs with the right properties. Although this is not essential we consider PBHs
produced at the end of a period of inflation with a blue spectrum of
fluctuations. We constrain the value of the spectral tilt in order to obtain
the required PBH comoving density. We then assume that PBHs grow by accreting
quintessence showing that their mass scales like the horizon mass while the
quintessence field itself is scaling. We find that if scaling is broken just
before nucleosynthesis (as is the case with some attractive non-minimally
coupled models) we obtain the appropriate PBH mass distribution. Hawking
evaporation is negligible in most cases, but we also discuss situations in
which the interplay of accretion and evaporation is relevant.

spectroscopic binary(SB1) nature of this system and allow us to obtain, for the
first time,the orbital solution of the system as in the case of a SB2 system.
We have determined precise radial velocities of both components: for the
primary by using the cross correlation technique, and for the secondary by
using its chromospheric emission lines. We have obtained a circular orbit with
an orbital period of 2.1663 days, very close to its photometric period of 2.24
days (indicating synchronous rotation). The spectral type (K5V) we determined
for our spectra and the mass ratio (1.8) and minimum masses (Msin^{3}i)
resulting from the orbital solution are compatible with the observed K5V
primary and an unseen M3V secondary. Using this spectral classification, the
projected rotational velocity (vsini, of 17.1 km/s}) obtained from the width of
the cross-correlation function and the data provided by Hipparcos, we have
derived other fundamental stellar parameters. The kinematics and the
non-detection of the LiI line indicate that it is an old star. The analysis of
the optical chromospheric activity indicators from the CaII H & K to CaII IRT
lines, by using the spectral subtraction technique, indicates that both
components of the binary system show high levels of chromospheric activity.
H_alpha emission above the continuum from both components is a persistent

close to the central star. But they do possess significant amounts of cold and

clear that the resonance enhancement of neutrino oscillations in matter cannot
exist either for absence of matter polarizations. Masses are not generated and

spontaneously broken continuous symmetry in the quantum field theory of a free
massless (pseudo)scalar field in 1+1-dimensional space-time (Comm. Math. Phys.

Wightman's statement about the non-existence of a quantum field theory of a
free massless (pseudo)scalar field in 1+1-dimensional space-time in terms of
Wightman's observables defined on the test functions from S(R^2). Referring to
our results (Eur. Phys. J. C 24, 653 (2002)) we argue that a formulation of a
quantum field theory of a free massless (pseudo)scalar field in terms of
Wightman's observables defined on the test functions from S_0(R^2) is motivated
well by the possibility to remove a collective zero-mode motion of the ``center
of mass'' of a free massless (pseudo)scalar field (Eur. Phys. J. C 24, 653
(2002)) responsible for infrared divergences of the Wightman functions. We show
that in the quantum field theory of a free massless (pseudo)scalar field with
Wightman's observables defined on the test functions from S_0(R^2) a continuous
symmetry is spontaneously broken. Coleman's theorem reformulated for the test
functions from S_0(R^2) does not refute this result. We construct a most
general version of a quantum field theory of a self-coupled massless
(pseudo)scalar field with a conserved current. We show that this theory
satisfies Wightman's axioms and Wightman's positive definiteness condition with
Wightman's observables defined on the test functions from S(R^2) and possesses
spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. Nevertheless, in this theory the
generating functional of Green functions exists only when the collective
zero-mode is not excited by the external source.

the best known lattice sphere packings have `maximal lengths' and goes on to
write: ""In dimension 2 the conjecture means in particular that the hexagonal

many orbits in any given $G^C$-flag manifold $Z=G^C/Q$. The complex geometry of
these orbits is of interest, e.g., for the associated representation theory.
The open orbits $D$ generally possess only the constant holomorphic functions,
and the relevant associated geometric objects are certain positive-dimensional
compact complex submanifolds of $D$ which, with very few well-understood
exceptions, are parameterized by the Wolf cycle domains $\Omega_W(D)$ in
$G^C/K^C$, where $K$ is a maximal compact subgroup of $G$. Thus, for the
various domains $D$ in the various ambient spaces $Z$, it is possible to
compare the cycle spaces $\Omega_W(D)$.
  The main result here is that, with the few exceptions mentioned above, for a
fixed real form $G$ all of the cycle spaces $\Omega_W(D)$ are the same. They
are equal to a universal domain $\Omega_{AG}$ which is natural from the the
point of view of group actions and which, in essence, can be explicitly
computed.
  The essential technical result is that if $\hat \Omega $ is a $G$-invariant
Stein domain which contains $\Omega_{AG}$ and which is Kobayashi hyperbolic,
then $\hat \Omega =\Omega_{AG}$. The equality of the cycle domains follows from
the fact that every $\Omega_W(D)$ is itself Stein, is hyperbolic, and contains
$\Omega_{AG}$.

C^3 invariant under the U(1)-action (z_1,z_2,z_3) --> (gz_1,g^{-1}z_2,z_3) for
unit complex numbers g, using analytic methods. The three papers are surveyed
in math.DG/0206016.
  Let N be such a U(1)-invariant SL 3-fold. Then |z_1|^2-|z_2|^2=2a on N for
some real a. Locally, N can be written as a kind of graph of functions u,v :
R^2 --> R satisfying a nonlinear Cauchy-Riemann equation depending on a. When a
is nonzero, u,v are smooth and N is nonsingular. But if a=0, there may be
points (x,0) where u,v are not differentiable, corresponding to singular points
of N.
  The first paper math.DG/0111324 studied the case a nonzero, and proved
existence and uniqueness for solutions of two Dirichlet problems derived from
the nonlinear Cauchy-Riemann equation. This yields existence and uniqueness of
a large class of nonsingular U(1)-invariant SL 3-folds in C^3, with boundary
conditions.
  The second paper math.DG/0111326 extended these results to weak solutions of
the Dirichlet problems when a=0, giving existence and uniqueness of many
singular U(1)-invariant SL 3-folds in C^3, with boundary conditions.
  This third paper studies the singularities of these SL 3-folds. We show that
under mild conditions the singularities are isolated, and have a multiplicity
n>0, and one of two types. Examples are constructed with every multiplicity and
type. We also prove the existence of large families of U(1)-invariant special
Lagrangian fibrations of open sets in C^3, including singular fibres.

decay exponentially in time. This result is asymptotic and rigorous. The decay
rate is related to the Ruelle-Pollicott resonances. Nearly all chaotic model
systems, that are studied by physicists, are not hyperbolic. For many such
systems it is known that exponential decay takes place for a long time. It may
not be asymptotic, but it may persist for a very long time, longer than any
time of experimental relevance. In this review a heuristic method for
calculation of this exponential decay of correlations in time is presented. It
can be applied to model systems, where there are no rigorous results concerning
this exponential decay. It was tested for several realistic systems (kicked
rotor and kicked top) in addition to idealized systems (baker map and perturbed
cat map). The method consists of truncation of the evolution operator
(Frobenius-Perron operator), and performing all calculations with the resulting
finite dimensional matrix. This finite dimensional approximation can be
considered as coarse graining, and is equivalent to the effect of noise. The
exponential decay rate of the chaotic system is obtained when the
dimensionality of the approximate evolution operator is taken to infinity,
resulting in infinitely fine resolution, that is equivalent to vanishing noise.
The corresponding Ruelle-Pollicott resonances can be calculated for many
systems that are beyond the validity of the Ruelle-Pollicott theorem.

mechanics since the early works of Pantcharatnam and Berry. Their origin relies
on the geometric nature of state spaces and has been studied in many different
systems such as spins, polarized light and atomic physics. Recent works have
explored their application in interferometry and quantum computation. Earlier
works suggest how to observe these phases in single quantum systems
adiabatically driven by external classical devices or sources, where, by
classical, we mean any system whose state does not change considerably during
the interaction time: an intense magnetic field interacting with a spin 1/2, or
a birefringent medium interacting with polarized light. Here we propose a
feasible experiment to investigate quantum effects in these phases, arising
when this classical source drives not a single quantum system, but two
interacting ones. In particular, we show how to observe a signature of field
quantization through a vacuum effect in Berry's phase. To do so, we describe
the interaction of an atom and a quantized cavity mode altogether driven by an
external quasi-classical field.
