core-collapse supernovae produce gamma-ray bursts. The burst may be delayed
significantly (hours - days) after the supernova, as suggested by recent

significant sources of gravitational radiation with a chirp signal similar to a

  Series",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We address a numerical instability that arises in the directionally split
computation of hydrodynamic flows when shock fronts are parallel to a grid
plane. Transverse oscillations in pressure, density and temperature are
produced that are exacerbated by thermal instability when cooling is present,
forming post--shock `stripes'. These are orthogonal to the classic post--shock
'ringing' fluctuations. The resulting post--shock `striping' substantially
modifies the flow. We discuss three different methods to resolve this problem.
These include (1) a method based on artificial viscosity; (2) grid--jittering
and (3) a new localized oscillation filter that acts on specific grid cells in
the shock front. These methods are tested using a radiative wall shock problem
with an embedded shear layer. The artificial viscosity method is unsatisfactory
since, while it does reduce post--shock ringing, it does not eliminate the
stripes and the excessive shock broadening renders the calculation of cooling
inaccurate, resulting in an incorrect shock location. Grid--jittering
effectively counteracts striping. However, elsewhere on the grid, the shear
layer is unphysically diffused and this is highlighted in an extreme case. The
oscillation filter method removes stripes and permits other high velocity
gradient regions of the flow to evolve in a physically acceptable manner. It
also has the advantage of only acting on a small fraction of the cells in a two
or three dimensional simulation and does not significantly impair performance.

with a negative perturbation \delta may evolve as a separate homogeneous
universe with a local expansion parameter H_V\simeq H_0(1-\delta/3). This
slightly low density ``universe'' will diverge from the mean, producing a void
of ever lower density. As a result, the contents of voids will ``fall'' outward
at a velocity equal to the difference between the local, and the mean expansion
parameters times the radius of the void. Observational constraints on the
outfall velocity can be placed as a result of the fortuitous event that void,
and non-void hydrogen LyA absorbers have distinct characteristics -- both in
their equivalent width distributions and their Doppler parameter distributions
-- which are clearly distinguished when cloud environments are measured in
terms of the sum of the tidal fields of surrounding galaxies acting on the
cloud (Manning 2002). These constraints dictate that the radial outfall
velocity from an average void of radius ~ 15 h_{75}^{-1} Mpc must be less than
\~100 km/s. The implications of this are probed with a ``negative'' top-hat
simulation, using a 1-D Lagrangian code, to determine the relationship between
the mass deficit in voids and the local expansion parameter in a flat lambda
cosmology. The outfall velocity constraint shows that the void matter density
must be greater than 75% of the mean matter density. I argue that this implies

relativistic stars, undergoing a quark deconfinement phase transition. Such
phase transitions have been suggested to yield an observable signal in the
braking index of spinning-down pulsars, which is based on a ``backbending''
behaviour of the moment of inertia. We focus on a particular equation of state
that has been used before to study this behaviour, and find that for the
population of normal pulsars the moment of inertia does not exhibit a
backbending behaviour. In contrast, for supramassive millisecond pulsars a very
strong backbending behaviour is found. Essentially, once a quark core appears
in a spinning-down supramassive millisecond pulsar, the star spins up and
continues to do so until it reaches the instability to collapse. This strong
spin-up behaviour makes it easier to distinguish a phase transition in such
pulsars: a negative first time-derivative of the rotational period suffices and
one does not have to measure the braking index. In the spin-up era, the usually
adopted spin-down power law fails to describe the evolution of the angular
velocity. We adopt a general-relativistic spin-down power law and derive the
equations that describe the angular velocity and braking index evolution in
rapidly rotating pulsars.

luminosities and the depth of their dark matter halos (measured on 260 \hinv

confirm these results. We begin by assembling a sample of 618 relatively
isolated host galaxies, surrounded by a total of 1225 substantially fainter
satellites. We observe the mean dynamical effect of these hosts on the motions
of their satellites by assembling velocity difference histograms. Dividing the
sample by host properties, we find significant variations in satellite velocity
dispersion with host luminosity. We quantify these variations using a simple
dynamical model, measuring \mtsd a dynamical mass within 260 \hinv kpc. The
appropriateness of this mass reconstruction is checked by conducting a similar
analysis within an N-body simulation. Comparison between the dynamical and

sets a limit on axion-photon coupling constant to be
$g_{a\gamma\gamma}<6.8-10.9\times10^{-10}GeV^{-1}$ for the axion mass of
0.05<m_a<0.27eV at 95% confidence level, which is more stringent than the limit

h^{-1}_{50}$ Mpc in diameter. Multicolour CCD observations yield photometric
redshifts indicating that a significant fraction of the optical galaxies in
this region is at a redshift of z=0.3. This is supported by spectroscopic
measurements of 4 galaxies in the SDSS survey at a mean z=0.27. We present VLA
images at 20 cm (NVSS) and 90 cm wavelengths, showing the detailed radio
structure of the filaments. Comparison with the VLA high resolution FIRST radio
survey shows that the diffuse emission is not due to known individual point
sources. The diffuse radio-emission has a spectral index $\alpha \lesssim
-0.5$, and is most likely synchrotron emission from relativistic charged
particles in an inter-galactic magnetic field. Furthermore, this optical/radio
structure is detected in X-rays by the ROSAT all-sky survey. It has a 0.1--2.4
keV luminosity of about $10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and shows an extended highly
non-relaxed morphology. These observations suggest that ZwCl 2341.1+0000 is
possibly a proto-cluster of galaxies in which we are witnessing the process of
structure formation. We show (both analytically and by numerical simulations)
that the energetics of accretion shocks generated in forming large-scale
structures are sufficient to produce enough high energy cosmic-ray (CR)
electrons required to explain the observed radio emission, provided a magnetic
field of strength of about 1 micro Gauss is present there.Thus it is the first
evidence of cosmic-ray particle acceleration and magnetic fields occuring on a
super-cluster scale. (Abridged)

qualitatively} studied in the context of competing orders: antiferromagnetism,
d-wave superconductivity and $d$-density wave. {\it Local} correlation
functions are estimated from a mean-field solution of the $t-J$ Hamiltonian.
With decreasing doping the superconducting mean-field $T^{MF}_{c}$ and order
parameter $d$ begin to decrease below some characteristic doping $x_{c} \simeq
0.2$ where short-range antiferromagnetic correlations begin to develop. {\it
Dynamical} properties that involve the energy spectrum, such as the normal
state pseudogap, are calculated from effective interactions that are consistent
with the above-mentioned local correlation functions. The total excitation gap
$\Delta_{tg}$ (in the superconducting state) and the normal state pseudogap
$\Delta_{pg}$ are in good agreement with experimental results. Properties of
the condensate are estimated using an effective pairing interaction $V_{eff}$
which takes into account (pair breaking) antiferromagnetic correlations. These
condensate properties include condensation energy U(0), coherence gap
$\Delta_{cg}$ and critical field $H_{c2}$. The calculated coherence gap closely
follows the doping dependence of $T_{c}$ or $d$, and is approximately given as
$\Delta_{cg} \sim \Delta_{tg}-\Delta_{pg}$ within our numerical uncertainties.
The systematic decrease of superfluidity ($d$, U(0), $\Delta_{cg}$, $H_{c2}$),
and systematic increase of $\Delta_{pg}$ and $\Delta_{tg}$ with decreasing
doping below $x_{c}$ have their natural explanation in our approach. The
overall description is however qualitative since it does not appear possible to
obtain results that are in quantitative agreement with experiment for all
physical quantities.

exploits relevant physical properties, such as continuity, correspondence, and

distributed computational economy as an effective metaphor for the management

enables the regulation of supply and demand for resources and provides an
incentive for resource owners for participating in the Grid and motives the
users to trade-off between the deadline, budget, and the required level of

is demonstrated that one can construct a supergravity analogue of the tachyon
potential. Remarkably, the (regularized) minimum value of the potential turns
out to be V(T_{0})=-2m with m denoting the ADM mass of a single Dp-brane. This
result, in a sense, appears to confirm that Sen's conjecture for the tachyon
condensation on unstable D-branes is indeed correct although the analysis used
here is semi-classical in nature and hence should be taken with some care. Also
shown is the fact that the tachyon mass squared m^2_{T} (which has started out
as being negative) can actually become positive definite and large as the
tachyon rolls down toward the minimum of its potential. It indeed signals the
possibility of successful condensation of the tachyon since it shows that near
the minimum of its potential, tachyon can become heavy enough to disappear from
the massless spectrum. Some cosmological implications of this tachyon potential
in the context of ``rolling tachyons'' is also discussed.

predicts the existence of Goldstone bosons. We explicitly show that, in the
