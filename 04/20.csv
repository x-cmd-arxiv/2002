constant alpha different from the present value, including many sources of

contributions arising from Coulomb barrier penetration, photon coupling to

the primordial abundances to depend more weakly on alpha than previously
estimated, by up to a factor of 2 in the case of ^7Li. We discuss the
constraints on variations in alpha from the individual abundance measurements
and the uncertainties affecting these constraints. While the present best
measurements of primordial D/H, ^4He/H, and ^7Li/H may be reconciled pairwise
by adjusting alpha and the universal baryon density, no value of alpha allows
all three to be accommodated simultaneously without consideration of systematic
error. The combination of measured abundances with observations of acoustic
peaks in the cosmic microwave background favors no change in alpha within the
uncertainties.

formation. Studying GRB host galaxies offers a method of finding low-luminosity
submillimetre galaxies, which cannot be identified either in optical Lyman
break surveys, because so much of their star formation is hidden by dust, or in
submillimetre surveys, because their submillimetre fluxes are close to or below
the confusion limit. Much of the star formation in the Universe could have

(excepting the normalisation of the braking rate). In AM Her binaries, magnetic
braking is reduced as the wind from the secondary star may be trapped within
the magnetosphere of the white dwarf primary. This reduced braking fills the
period gap from its short-period end as the dipole magnetic moment of the white
dwarf increases. The consistency of these models with the observed distribution
of CVs, both AM Her and non-AM Her type, provides compelling evidence
supporting magnetic braking as the agent of angular momentum loss among

numerically and compared with theoretical predictions based on statistical
mechanics. The novel aspect considered here is that the vortices have greatly
different circulation strengths. As envisaged by Onsager, such an arrangement
leads to a substantial amplification of statistical trends such as the
preferred clustering of the strong vortices in either same-signed or
oppositely-signed pairs, depending on the overall energy level. A
microcanonical ensemble based on the conserved total energy E and angular
momentum M for the whole vortex system is then used, in which the few strong
vortices are treated as a subsystem in contact with a reservoir composed of the
many weak vortices. It is shown that allowing for the finite size of this
reservoir is essential in order to predict the statistics of the strong
vortices accurately. Notably, this goes beyond the standard canonical ensemble
with positive or negative temperature. A certain approximation is then shown to
allow a single random sample of uniformly distributed vortex configurations to
be used to predict the strong vortex statistics for all possible values of E
and M. Detailed predictions for distribution functions are then made for
comparison with three simulated cases of near-zero M and low, neutral, or high
E. It is found that the statistical mechanics predictions compare remarkably
well with the numerical results, including a prediction of vortex accumulation
at the cylinder wall for low values of E.

$\Phi$, should be coupled to some external fields. An external bulk real scalar
field, $\psi$, minimally coupled to gravity is proved to be satisfactory. At
low temperature, the coupling of $\psi$ to the electromagnetic (EM) field
allows $\Phi$ to be much stronger coupled to the EM field than in the genuine
five dimensional KK theory. It is shown that the coupling of $\Phi$ to the
geomagnetic field may explain the observed dispersion in laboratory
measurements of the (effective) gravitational constant. The analysis takes into
account the spatial variations of the geomagnetic field. Except the high PTB
value, the predictions are found in good agreement with all of the experimental
data.

structure, (ii) quantization of electric charge, (iii) meeting of the three
gauge couplings, (iv) neutrino oscillations [in particular the value of $\Delta
m^2(\nu_\mu-\nu_\tau)$, suggested by SuperK], (v) the intricate pattern of the
masses and mixings of the fermions, including the smallness of $V_{cb}$ and the
largeness of $\theta^{osc}_{\nu_{\mu}\nu_{\tau}}$, and (vi) the need for B-L as
a generator to implement baryogenesis (via lepto-genesis). A concrete proposal
is presented within a predictive SO(10)/G(224)-framework that successfully
describes the masses and mixings of all fermions, including the neutrinos -
with eight predictions, all in agreement with observation. Within this
framework, a systematic study of proton decay is carried out, which (a) pays
special attention to its dependence on the fermion masses, (b) limits the
threshold corrections so as to preserve natural coupling unification, and (c)
uses recently improved values of the matrix element and renormalization
effects. Allowing for both MSSM and its proposed variant, the so-called ESSM,
as effective low-energy theories, the study shows that a conservative upper
limit on the proton lifetime is about (1/3 - 2)$\times 10^{34}$ years, with
$\bar{\nu}K^{+}$ being the dominant decay mode, and quite possibly
$\mu^{+}K^{0}$ and $e^+\pi^0$ being prominent. This in turn strongly suggests
that an improvement in the current sensitivity by a factor of five to ten ought
to reveal proton decay. For comparison, some alternatives to the conven- tional
approach to unification pursued here are mentioned at the end.

equations with coefficients depending on coth (pi lambda). The poles cancel in
the wave function, bilinear combination of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic

zero surface tension solution has asymptotic behavior consistent with selection
theory.Such singular effects therefore cannot be traced back to steady state
selection theory, and imply a drastic global change in the structure of
phase-space flow. They can be interpreted in the framework of a recently
introduced dynamical solvability scenario according to which surface tension
unfolds the structually unstable flow, restoring the hyperbolicity of
multifinger fixed points.
