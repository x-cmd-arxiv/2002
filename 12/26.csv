light curves for observers located at different viewing angles, $\theta_{obs}$,
from the jet symmetry axis. The largest uncertainty in the jet dynamics is the
degree of lateral energy transfer. Thus, we use two simple models, that make
opposite and extreme assumptions for this point, and calculate the light curves
for an external density that is either homogeneous, or decreases as the square
of the distance from the source. The Lorentz factor and kinetic energy per unit
solid angle are initially taken to be power laws of the angle from the jet
axis. We perform a qualitative comparison between the resulting light curves
and afterglow observations. This constrains the jet structure, and poses
problems for a `universal' jet model, where all GRB jets are assumed to be
intrinsically identical, and differ only by our viewing angle, $\theta_{obs}$.

magnetic flux tube produces an associated non-linear, non-conservative axial
MHD force which pumps plasma from regions where the flux tube diameter is small
to regions where it is large. In particular, this force will ingest plasma into
the ends of a fat, initially potential flux tube and then pump the ingested
plasma towards the middle bulge, thereby causing mass accumulation at the
bulge. The ingested plasma convects frozen-in toroidal magnetic flux which
accumulates at the middle as well. Flux accumulation at the bulge has the
remarkable consequence of causing the bulge to diminish so that the flux tube
becomes axially uniform as observed in coronal loops. Stagnation of the
convergent plasma flow at the middle heats the plasma. A small number of tail
particles bouncing synchronously between approaching fluid elements can be
Fermi-accelerated to very high energies. Since driving a current along a flux
tube is tantamount to helicity injection into the flux tube, this mass
ingestion, heating, and straightening should be ubiquitous to helicity
injection processes.

symplectic integration algorithms which are both fast and accurate. In this
paper, we study a symplectic integration method wherein the symplectic map
representing the Hamiltonian system is refactorized using polynomial symplectic
maps. This method is analyzed in detail for the three degree of freedom case.
We obtain explicit formulas for the action of the constituent polynomial maps
on phase space variables.

in all the predominant types of geological rock formations appearing in Cyprus
was measured. Soil samples were collected from each rock type, sealed in
1-litre plastic Marinelli beakers, and measured in the laboratory for 24 hours
each. From the measured gamma-ray spectra, activity concentrations were
determined for Th-232 (range from 1.3 to 52.8 Bq/kg), U-238 (from 0.9 to 90.3
Bq/kg) and K-40 (from 13 to 894 Bq/kg). Elemental concentrations mean values of
(2.8 +- 0.7) ppm, (1.3 +- 0.3) ppm and (0.6 +- 0.1) % were extracted, for
thorium, uranium and potassium, respectively. Absorbed dose rates in air
outdoors were calculated to be in the range of 0.1-50 nGy/h, depending on the
geological features, with an overall mean value of (14.7 +- 7.3) nGy/h. The
corresponding effective dose rates per person outdoors were estimated to be
between 0.1 and 61.4 microSv/y, assuming a 20% occupancy factor.

\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi> |\phi> + i |\phi> |\psi>) $ instead of symmetric or
anti-symmetric states, as natural candidates for optimally entangled states
constructed from these states. We show that such states firstly have on the
average a high value of concurrence, secondly can be constructed by a universal
unitary operator independent of the input states. We also show that these
states are the only ones which can be produced with perfect fidelity by any
quantum operation designed for intertwining two pure states with a relative
phase. A probabilistic method is proposed for producing any pre-determined
relative phase into the combination of any two arbitrary states.
