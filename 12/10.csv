long wavelengths to short ones: if the symmetry is exact it implies that
spacetime must look the same at all length scales. Several approaches to
quantum gravity, however, suggest that there may be a Lorentz violating
microscopic structure of spacetime, for example discreteness,
non-commutativity, or extra dimensions. Here we determine a very strong
constraint on a type of Lorentz violation that produces a maximum electron
speed less than the speed of light. We use the observation of 100 MeV
synchrotron radiation from the Crab nebula to improve the previous limits by a
factor of 40 million, ruling out this type of Lorentz violation, and thereby
providing an important constraint on theories of quantum gravity.

embedded in relatively fainter regions, with complex patterns of recurrence and
clustering of flares. We identify precursors preceding the flaring activity.
Pulse profiles during the flares appear to be simple sinusoids, and pulsed
fractions are proportional to the flare intensities. We fit Gaussian functions
to flare peaks to estimate the mean full-width-half-maximum to be $\sim$68 s.
Significant rapid aperiodic variability exists up to a few hertz during the
flares, which is related to the appearance of narrow, spiky peaks in the light
curves. While spectral fits and softness ratios show overall spectral softening
as the flare intensity increases, the narrow, spiky peaks do not follow this
trend. The mean fluence of the flare peaks is (3.1 $\pm$ 2.9) $\times$
10$^{40}$ ergs in the 2.5--25 keV energy range, with its maximum at $\sim$1.9

that inhomogeneous accretion columns onto the neutron star polar caps are

cosmological tools. We discuss two particularly interesting types of probes.
First, by combining gravitational-wave measurements with information about the
universe's cosmography, we can study the evolution of black hole masses and
merger rates as a function of redshift, providing information about the growth
of structures at high redshift and possibly constraining hierarchical merger
scenarios. Second, if it is possible to associate an ``electromagnetic''
counterpart with a coalescence, it may be possible to measure both redshift and
luminosity distance to an event with less than ~1% error. Such a measurement
would constitute an amazingly precise cosmological standard candle.
Unfortunately, gravitational lensing uncertainties will reduce the quality of
this candle significantly. Though not as amazing as might have been hoped, such
a candle would nonetheless very usefully complement other distance-redshift
probes, in particular providing a valuable check on systematic effects in such
measurements.

whole the radial number distribution of bright lumps largely traces the
underlying exponential-disk light profiles, but peaks at a 10 percent smaller
scale length. Moreover, the presence of a tail of star forming regions out to
at least six optical scale lengths provides evidence against a systematic star
formation truncation within that galaxy extension. Considering these findings,
we apply a scale length-independent concentration index, taking into account
the implied non-uniform random spread of star formation regions throughout the
disk. The number profiles frequently manifest a second, minor peak at about two
scale lengths. Relying on a two-dimensional stochastic self-propagating star
formation model, we show these secondary peaks to be consistent with triggered
star formation; for a few of the brighter galaxies a peculiar peak distribution
is observed that is conceivably due to the onset of shear provided by
differential rotation. On scales between 100 and 1000 pc, and by taking into
account exponential-disk structure, bright lumps reveal cluster dimensions
between 1.3 and 2, with a weak trend to higher dimensions for brighter

magnetic flux rings in the radiative interior of a uniformly rotating
early-type star. Our physical model describes a thin, axisymmetric, toroidal
flux tube that is released from the outer boundary of the convective core, and
is acted upon by buoyant, centrifugal, Coriolis, magnetic tension, and
aerodynamic drag forces. We find that rings emitted in the equatorial plane can
attain a stationary equilibrium state that is stable with respect to small
displacements in radius, but is unstable when perturbed in the meridional
direction. Rings emitted at other latitudes travel toward the surface along
trajectories that largely parallel the rotation axis of the star. Over much of
the ascent, the instantaneous rise speed is determined by the rate of heating
by the absorption of radiation that diffuses into the tube from the external
medium. Since the time scale for this heating varies like the square of the
tube cross-sectional radius, for the same field strength, thin rings rise more
rapidly than do thick rings. For a reasonable range of assumed ring sizes and
field strengths, our results suggest that buoyancy is a viable mechanism for
bringing magnetic flux from the core to the surface, being capable of
accomplishing this transport in a time that is generally much less than the
stellar main sequence lifetime.

exchange driven by stellar wind are presented. 2D simulations have been carried
out using the Roe-Oscher scheme. The fine grid we used allowed us to detect the
details of the flow structure. In particular, it was found out that solutions
with the wind velocity V of the order of the orbital velocity of the system Vs
are unstable: in solutions with V<Vs -- the steady accretion disk takes place
and if V>Vs -- the cone shock forms. Consideration of the minor variations of
the wind velocity V around Vs shows that they can influence greatly the flow
structure causing transition from disk accretion to the accretion from the
flow. During the flow rearrangement period (the accretion disk destruction) the
accretion rate increases in dozens times for a short time (~0.1 of the orbital
period of the system). This change can result in the drop-off of the gas from
the accretor that is usually associated with activity in these systems.

characteristic redshift with temperature of the interstellar 6.85 micron

produce little distinct spectral signature but rather a pseudo-continuum if a

therefore go undetected in IR spectra of interstellar ice. In the ISM, where
additional mechanisms such as surface chemistry and additional elements such as

simply, fermions in those materials are somewhat gapped due to Coulomb
attraction. This Coulomb attraction naturally captures the polaronic effect in
manganites. $E_I$ is found to be the only essential parameter that predicts

N-flavour QED3. Here, in the isotropic limit, for N<N_0c, a critical number of
fermions, a dynamical mass is generated which corresponds to the formation of a
spin density wave. We study the effects of strong velocity anisotropy (v_F \neq
v_\Delta) on dynamical mass generation. Solutions are given for the dynamical
mass at both N=2 and N=100, and so we show that the critical number of fermions
N_c>100. However, we argue that N_c=N_0c, when we go beyond the approximations
used to derive our mass gap equations. We expect, though, that our solution for

which the whole thermal packet is considered to be in the same renormalized
valley at large time : this assumption is exact only in the limit $\mu \to 0$

generalize the usual RSRG method to allow for the spreading of the thermal

series expansions in $\mu$ of all observables : at order $\mu^n$, it is
sufficient to consider a spreading of the thermal packet onto at most $(1+n)$
traps in each sample, and to average with the appropriate measure over the
samples. For the directed trap model, we show explicitly up to order $\mu^2$
how to recover the diffusion front, the thermal width, and the localization
parameter $Y_2$. We moreover compute the localization parameters $Y_k$ for

organisms is highly controversial. It is commonly believed, for example, that
there is a large-scale trend in evolution towards increasing complexity, but
empirical and theoretical arguments undermine this belief. Natural selection
results in organisms that are well adapted to their local environments, but it
is not clear how local adaptation can produce a global trend. In this paper, I
present a simple computational model, in which local adaptation to a randomly
changing environment results in a global trend towards increasing evolutionary
versatility. In this model, for evolutionary versatility to increase without
bound, the environment must be highly dynamic. The model also shows that
unbounded evolutionary versatility implies an accelerating evolutionary pace. I
believe that unbounded increase in evolutionary versatility is a large-scale
trend in evolution. I discuss some of the testable predictions about organismal
evolution that are suggested by the model.

boson is light and that it could have already been discovered at LEP 2, or
might be found at the Tevatron Run 2. In the context of a TeV^-1 size extra
dimensional model, we argue that the Higgs boson production rates at LEP and
the Tevatron are suppressed, while they might be enhanced at the LHC or at
CLIC. This is due to the possible mixing between brane and bulk components of
the Higgs boson, that is, the non-trivial brane-bulk `location' of the lightest
Higgs. To parametrize this mixing, we consider two Higgs doublets, one confined
to the usual space dimensions and the other propagating in the bulk.
Calculating the production and decay rates for the lightest Higgs boson, we
find that compared to the standard model (SM), the cross section receives a
suppression well below but an enhancement close to and above the
compactification scale M_c. This impacts the discovery of the lightest (SM
like) Higgs boson at colliders. To find a Higgs signal in this model at the
Tevatron Run 2 or at the LC with sqrt(s)=1.5 TeV, a higher luminosity would be
required than in the SM case. Meanwhile, at the LHC or at CLIC with sqrt(s) ~
3-5 TeV one might find highly enhanced production rates. This will enable the
latter experiments to distinguish between the extra dimensional and the SM for
M_c up to about 6 TeV.

approach to the decoupling limit, where the properties of the lightest CP-even
Higgs boson of the MSSM are nearly indistinguishable from those of the SM Higgs
boson is emphasized.

However, a carefully analysis (detailed below) shows that the original Hestenes

the mathematical and physical basis for a comprehensive definition of the

on a general Riemann-Cartan spacetime admitting a spin structure and to give a
mathematically rigorous derivation of the so called Dirac-Hestenes equation
(DHE) when spacetime is a Lorentzian. To this aim we introduce the Clifford
bundle of multivector fields (Cl(M,g)) and the left
(Cl_{Spin_{1,3}^{e}}^{l}(M)) and right (Cl_{Spin_{1,3}^{e}}^{r}(M))
spin-Clifford bundles on the spin manifold (M,g)
  The relation between left ideal algebraic spinor fields (LIASF) and
Dirac-Hestenes spinor fields (both fields are sections of
Cl_{Spin_{1,3}^{e}}^{l}(M)) is clarified. We study in details the theory of the
covariant derivatives of Clifford and left and right spin-Clifford fields.
Moreover, we find a consistent Dirac equation for a DHSF (denoted DECl^{l}) on
a Lorentzian spacetime.
  We succeeded also in obtaining a representation of the DECl^{l} in the
Clifford bundle Cl(M,g). It is such equation that we call the DHE and it is
satisfied by even multivector fields (EMFS). Of course, such a EMFS is not a
spinor field. We provide moreover a consistent theory for the covariant
derivatives of Clifford and spinor fields of all kinds. We emphasize that the
DECl^{l} and the DHE, although related, are equations of different mathematical
natures. We study also the local Lorentz invariance and the electromagnetic
gauge invariance and show that only for the DHE such transformations are of the
same mathematical nature, thus suggesting a possible link between them.

Maxwell, Dirac and the Seiberg-Witten equations. First we investigatethe
Maxwell-Dirac equivalence (MDE) of the first kind. Crucial to that proposed
equivalence is the possibility of solving for $\Psi$(a representative on a
given spinorial frame of a Dirac-Hestenes spinor field (DHSF)) the equation
$F=\Psi \gamma_{21} \sim{\Psi}$, where F is a given electromagnetic field. Such
task is presented in this paper and it permits to clarify some possible
objections to the MDE which claims that no MDE may exist, because F has six
(real) degrees of freedom and $\Psi$ has eight (real) degrees of freedom. Also,
we review the generalized Maxwell equation describing charges and monopoles.
The enterprise is worth even if there is no evidence until now for magnetic
monopoles, because there are at least two faithful field equations that have
the form that equations. One is the generalized Hertz potential field equation
associated with Maxwell theory and the other is a (non linear) equation
satisfied by the 2-form field, which is part of a representative of a DHSF that
solves the Dirac-Hestenes equation for a free electron. This is a new and
surprising result, which can also be called MDE of the second kind. It strongly
suggests that the electron is a composed system with more elementary
  ""charges"" of the electric and magnetic types. Finally, we use the MDE of the
first kind together with a reasonable hypothesis to give a derivation of the
famous Seiberg-Witten equations on Minkowski spacetime.

characterizations of manifolds which fibre homotopically over S^1 or an

observations have emerged from this dataset which require theoretical
examination. First, there is clear evidence of limiting fragmentation. Namely,
particle production in central Au+Au collisions, when expressed as $dN/d\eta'$
($\eta' \equiv \eta-y_{beam}$), becomes energy independent at high energy for a
broad region of $\eta'$ around $\eta'=0$. This energy-independent region grows
with energy, allowing only a limited region (if any) of longitudinal
boost-invariance. Second, there is a striking similarity between particle
production in e+e- and Au+Au collisions (scaled by the number of participating
nucleon pairs). Both the total number of produced particles and the
longitudinal distribution of produced particles are approximately the same in
e+e- and in scaled Au+Au. This observation was not predicted and has not been
explained. Finally, particle production has been found to scale approximately
with the number of participating nucleon pairs for $N_{part}>65$. This scaling
occurs both for the total multiplicity and for high $\pT$ particles (3 $<\pT<$
4.5 GeV/c).

form for the corrections to the energy and the wavefunction, for all
