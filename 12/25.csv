starburst region, from the ultraviolet to submillimetre wavelengths. This model
allows us to derive the star formation rate, optical depth by dust and apparent
effective radius of starburst regions at various wavelengths; as a result, the
intrinsic surface brightness of starburst regions can be derived. Using this
SED model, we analyse 16 UV-selected starburst galaxies and 10 ultraluminous
infrared galaxies. The derived star formation rates and optical depths are
compared with emission line measurements and found to be consistent. The
derived apparent effective radii are also consistent with observations. From
the SED analysis, we find a bimodal property of the star formation rate with
the optical depth and the compactness of stellar distributions. While mild
starbursts have a limiting intrinsic surface brightness L(bol) x r_e^{-2} ~
10^{12} Lsun kpc^{-2}, intense starbursts tend to be more heavily obscured and
concentrated within a characteristic scale of r_e ~ 0.3 kpc. We suggest that
the mild starbursts can be triggered by a self-gravitating disc instability in
which feedback is effective in the shallow gravitational potential. On the
other hand, the intense starbursts can be induced via an external dynamical
perturbation like galaxy merging, in which feedback is less effective due to
the deep gravitational potential attained by the large gas concentration within
the central starburst region.

the chiral phase transition at finite temperature, we investigate, in the

Since $\Sigma_R$ is the mass function of an ``unstable'' quasi-particle in
thermal field theories, it necessarily has non-trivial imaginary parts together
with non-trivial wave function renormalization constants. In the present
analysis we correctly respect this fact, and study, in the ladder
approximation, the effect of HTL resummed gauge boson propagator. Our results
with the use of numerical analysis, show the two facts; i) The chiral phase
transition is of second order, since the fermion mass is dynamically generated
at a critical value of the temperature $T_c$, or at the critical coupling
constant $\alpha_c$, without any discontinuity, and ii) the critical
temperature $T_c$ at fixed value of $\alpha$ is significantly lower than the
previous results, namely the restoration of chiral symmetry occurs at lower
temperature than previously expected. The second fact shows the importance of
correctly taking the essential thermal effect into the analysis of chiral phase
transition, which are, in the previous analyses, neglected due to the
inappropriate approximations. The procedure how to maximally respect the gauge
invariance in the present approximation, is also discussed.

in ${\cal N} = 4$ SUSY Yang--Mills theory on $S^3\times R$ in a double scaling
limit and scattering amplitudes of the String Theory on the pp-wave background.
The relation is found for two-- and three--point correlation functions in these
theories. As a by product we formulate a dictionary for the correspondence
between these theories: in particular, we find some unknown relations between
the parameters in these theories. Furthermore, we argue that the String Theory
on the pp--wave background is related to four--dimensional SUSY Yang--Mills
theory rather than to the reduced matrix quantum mechanics. We identify string
theory excitations which are related to the Kaluza--Klein excitation of the
Yang--Mills theory on $S^3$.

effective Woods-Saxon potential, which corresponds to the dispersive optical
model potential, is studied as dependent on A, Z, and E and on projectile type
(proton or neutron). For the first time, a parameterization of the Woods-Saxon
real part of the nucleon-nucleus potential is proposed for the 40<A<208 nuclei
at energy ranging from -60 MeV to +60 MeV, including a range near the Fermi
energy. The parameterization reflects the dispersion relation between the real
and imaginary parts of the optical model potential through the energy
dependence of the radius parameter of the real part of the potential. The
method to determine the imaginary part of the optical model potential, which is
symmetrical relative to the Fermi energy, is also proposed for the 40<A<208
nuclei. The differential elastic scattering cross sections, the total
interaction cross sections, the total proton reaction cross sections, and the
single-particle energies of the nucleon bound states calculated in terms of the
proposed nucleon-nucleus potential parameterization for some of the n,p+A
(40<A<208) systems are compared with the available experimental data, yielding
