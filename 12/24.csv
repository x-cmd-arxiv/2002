Previous estimates of parameters are confirmed, with sensitive measurements of
the power spectrum now ranging from \ell \sim 3 to 2800. Comparing individual
best model fits, we find that the addition of \Omega_\Lambda as a parameter
dramatically improves the fits. We also use the high-\ell data of ACBAR, along

the fraction of metal-poor stars seems to be approximately constant in all

be more prominent in those fields superposed on the disk and/or with the
presence of streams or substructures. This might indicate and possibly trace

black hole to bulge mass correlation, we use the X-ray luminosity function of
AGN and the cosmological evolution rate which are from ROSAT X-ray surveys to
estimate the cosmic star formation history associated with the black hole
growth. By the Basic assumption that the major black hole growth occurs during
the luminous AGN phase, the luminosity function of AGNs as a function of
redshift traces not only the accretion history of the black holes but also the
cosmic star formation history of the spheroids.
  Although the space density of the especially luminous QSOs is very low, we
show that the total amount of star formation associated with the massive black
hole growth is almost the same as that of Lyman Break Galaxies detected by the
current optical deep surveys. We thus argue that the optical deep surveys may
miss about half of the net star formation in our Universe, This is probably due
to in part significant dust extinction as well as the small field of view of
previous optical surveys which cannot sample such rare events with relatively
short time scale. However, the far infrared emission from the dust heated by
star fomation on-going during the black hole growth could sufficiently account
for the observed SCUBA number counts, and would be the probable dominating
energy source of the SUBA population.

sedimentation can increase the He/H abundance ratio in the cores of hot

expansion is connected with the phonon thermalization of the system. The
negative expansion is caused by reorientation of the C60 molecules. It is

examined numerically by modeling the surface-water interaction by an effective
potential. The effective potential is assumed to be given by an asymmetric
double well constrained by a repulsive surface towards $r=0$ and unbound at
large distances. The time and space dependent probability distribution $P(r,t)$
of the underlying Smoluchowski equation is solved by using Crank-Nicholson
method. The mean square displacement shows a transition from sub-diffusive
(exponent $\alpha \sim$ 0.43) to a super-diffusive (exponent $\alpha \sim$
1.75) behavior with time and ultimately to a diffusive dynamics. The decay of
self intermediate scattering function ($F_{s}(k,t)$) is non-exponential in
general and shows a power law behavior at the intermediate time. Such features
have been observed in several recent computer simulation studies on dynamics of
water in protein and micellar hydration shell. The present analysis provides a
simple microscopic explanation for the transition from the sub-diffusivity and
super-diffusivity. {\em The super-diffusive behavior is due to escape from the
well near the surface and the sub-diffusive behavior is due to return of
quasi-free molecules to form the bound state again, after the initial escape}

Such a reflex (decreasing) behavior of Tc is attributed to the weakening of

collapsing configuration, some of which may appear to be restrictive, and we
need to study carefully if these can be suitably motivated physically in a
realistic collapse scenario. It would appear that in a generic higher

develop as end states as indicated by the results here. The mathematical
approach developed here generalizes and unifies the earlier available results
on higher dimensional dust collapse as we point out. Further, the dependence of
black hole or naked singularity end states as collapse outcomes, on the nature
of the initial data from which the collapse develops, is brought out explicitly

consider here in some detail the genericity and stability aspects related to

they are suppressed by a factor of alpha^2/alpha_s^2. However, if both

the cross section that involves the fragmentation of each photon into a

E_{beam}/m_c, the ratio of the beam energy to the charm-quark mass, and this

perspectives. The first section introduces the key issues related to
cosmological constant and provides a brief historical overview. This is
followed by a summary of the kinematics and dynamics of the standard Friedmann
model of the universe paying special attention to features involving the
cosmological constant. Section 3 reviews the observational evidence for
cosmological constant, especially the supernova results, constraints from the
age of the universe and a few others. Theoretical models (quintessence,
tachyonic scalar field, ...) with evolving cosmological `constant' are
described from different perspectives in the next section. Constraints on dark
energy from structure formation and from CMBR anisotropies are discussed in the
next two sections. The latter part of the review (sections 7-11) concentrates
on more conceptual and fundamental aspects of the cosmological constant.
Section 7 provides some alternative interpretations of the cosmological
constant which could have a bearing on the possible solution to the problem.
Several relaxation mechanisms have been suggested in the literature to reduce
the cosmological constant to the currently observed value and some of these
attempts are described in section 8. Next section gives a brief description of

Jacobson radical J is a nilpotent Hopf ideal and H:=A/J is a semisimple
algebra. By using our homological results, we prove that the canonical
projection of A on H has a section which is an H-colinear algebra map.
Furthermore, if H is cosemisimple too, then we can choose this section to be an
(H,H)-bicolinear algebra morphism. This fact allows us to describe A as a
`generalized bosonization' of a certain algebra R in the category of
Yetter-Drinfeld modules over H. As an application we give a categorical proof
of Radford's result about Hopf algebras with projections. We also consider the
dual situation. In this case, many results that we obtain hold true for a large
enough class of H-module coalgebras, where H is a cosemisimple Hopf algebra.

  Segal topoi",,,,"math.AG math.AT",,"  In math.AG/0207028 we began the study of higher sheaf theory (i.e. stacks
theory) on higher categories endowed with a suitable notion of topology:
precisely, we defined the notions of S-site and of model site, and the
associated categories of stacks on them. This led us to study a notion of
\textit{model topos} (orginally due to C. Rezk), a model category version of
the notion of Grothendieck topos. In this paper we treat the analogous theory
starting from (1-)Segal categories in place of S-categories and model
categories. We introduce notions of Segal topologies, Segal sites and stacks
over them. We define an abstract notion of Segal topos and relate it with Segal
categories of stacks over Segal sites. We compare the notions of Segal topoi
and of model topoi, showing that the two theories are equivalent in some sense.
However, the existence of a nice Segal category of morphisms between Segal
categories allows us to improve the treatment of topoi in this context. In
particular we construct the 2-Segal category of Segal topoi and geometric
morphisms, and we provide a Giraud-like statement characterizing Segal topoi
among Segal categories. As an example of applications, we show how to
reconstruct a topological space up to homotopy from the Segal topos of locally
constant stacks on it, thus extending the main theorem of Toen, ""Vers une
interpretation Galoisienne de la theorie de l'homotopie"" (to appear in Cahiers
de top. et geom. diff. cat.) to the case of un-based spaces. We also give some
hints of how to define homotopy types of Segal sites: this approach gives a new
point of view and some improvements on the \'etale homotopy theory of schemes,
and more generally on the theory of homotopy types of Grothendieck sites as
defined by Artin and Mazur.

which usually considered as noise contaminating useful signal. Based on
temporal properties of this noise, it is shown that it can be made useful if
proper processed. Namely, the signal, which characterizes the total amount of
adsorbed analyte, should be subjected to a kind of amplitude discrimination (or
level crossing discrimination) with certain threshold. When the amount is equal
or above the threshold, the result of discrimination is standard dc signal,
otherwise it is zero. Analytes are applied at low concentration: the mean
adsorbed amount is below the threshold. The threshold is achieved from time to
time thanking to the fluctuations. The signal after discrimination is averaged
over a time window and used as the output of the whole device. Selectivity of
this device is compared with that of its primary adsorbing sites, based on
explicit description of the threshold-crossing statistics. It is concluded that
the whole sensor may have much better selectivity than do its individual
adsorbing sites.
