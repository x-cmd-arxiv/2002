observe among common Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays, UHECR, also High Energy
Neutrino-Induced Showers either blazing upward to the detectors at high (PeVs)

in air or vertically downward. A small fraction of these upward, horizontal and
vertical Shower maybe originated by direct astrophysical UHE neutrino
interacting on terrestrial air layers itself; however the dominant UHE neutrino
signal are Upward and Horizontal Tau Air-Showers, UPTAUS and HORTAUs (or Earth
skimming neutrinos), born within widest Earth Crust Crown (Sea or Rock) Areas,
by UHE nu_tau + Nuclei--> tau interactions, respectively at PeVs and GZK
energies: their rate and signatures are shown in a neutrino fluence map for
EUSO thresholds versus other UHE air interacting neutrino signals and
backgrounds. The effective target Masses originating HORTAUs seen by EUSO may
exceed (on sea) at 10^19 eV energy a wide and huge ring volume above
1/2*A_Euso*l_tau*(L_nu/2R_Earth)^2= 5130 km^3.
  The consequent HORTAUS event rate (even at 10% EUSO duty cycle lifetime) may
deeply test the expected Z-Burst models by at least a hundred of yearly events.
Even rarest but inescapable GZK neutrinos (secondary of photopion production of
observed cosmic UHECR) might be discovered in a few (or a tens) horizontal
shower events; in this view an extension of EUSO detectability up to E > 10^19
eV threshold is to be preferred. A wider collecting EUSO telescope (3m
diameter) might be considered.

respectively, are developed to address two major questions concenring galaxy
populations in deep infrared (IR) surveys: (1) Do normal late-type galaxies or
starburst galaxies (including galaxies with obscured AGNs) dominate among
sources in deep IR surveys? (2) How much do E/S0 galaxies contribute to the
counts in deep mid-infrared (MIR: 3 -- 20$\mu m$) surveys? Among three new
models for evolution of dusty galaxies, it is assumed in Model S1 that
starburst galaxies are the dominant population, and in Model S2 that normal
galaxies dominate. Model S3 is an intermediate model. Comparing the model
predictions with a wide range of observational data collected from the
literature, we find that none of these models can be ruled out, given the
uncertainties of the data. We show that the most direct method to distinguish
these models is to compare the predicted color distributions of IR galaxies
with observations, which will soon be available from the SWIRE survey. The
models for E/S0 galaxies follow a simple passive evolution approach. Among the
three E/S0 models (E1, E2 and E3) investigated in this paper, Model E2 which is
specified by a peak formation redshift $z_{peak}=2$, and an e-folding formation
time scale $\omega=2$ Gyr, fits the data best. This suggests a synchronization
between the evolution of E/S0 galaxies and of starburst galaxies, in the sense
that the peak of the formation function of E/S0s ($z_{peak}=2$) is close to the
peak of the evolution functions of starburst galaxies ($z_{peak} = 1.4$). New
predictions for counts and confusion limits in the SIRTF bands are presented.

been proposed that these variations are principally due to gravitational
lensing by a cosmologically distributed population of planetary mass objects.
This interpretation has implications for the observable properties of gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) -- as a source expands across the nano-arcsecond caustic network,
variability is expected -- and data on GRBs can be used to test the proposed
model of quasar variability. Here we employ an ultra-relativistic blast-wave
model of the source, with no intrinsic variations, to study the effects of
nanolensing on GRBs. Taken in isolation the light-curves of the caustic
crossings are predictable, and we find that a subset of the predicted
light-curves (the image-annihilating fold crossings) resemble the ``pulses''
which are commonly seen in long GRBs. Furthermore, for sources at high redshift
the expected time between caustic crossings is of order seconds, comparable to
the observed time between pulses. These points suggest that it might be
possible to model some of the observed variations of GRBs in terms of
nanolensing; however, our simulated light-curves exhibit a small depth of
modulation compared to what is observed. This means that the GRB data do not
significantly constrain the quasar nanolensing model; it also means that the
simplest nanolensing model cannot explain the observed GRB ``pulses''. Viable
nanolensing models for pulses probably require a large external beam shear. If
a viable model can be constructed it would effect a considerable simplification
in source modelling and, ironically, it would explain why no macro-lensed GRBs
have been identified to date.

lower redshift interlopers (mainly early--type galaxies at high redshift and

obtained from the Hubble Deep Field campaigns. The VLT final sample consists of
13 high z candidates, 4 of which are identified with high confidence as z>4.5

densities of 3.1 arcmin^-2 and 2 arcmin^-2, respectively. We show that the
observed Z<25 UV luminosity density appear to drop by about one order of
magnitude from z~3 to z~6. However, if we apply a threshold to obtain an
absolute--magnitude limited sample, the UV luminosity density results to be
roughly constant up to z~6. We finally show that recent semi-analytic
hierarchical models for galaxy formation, while predicting a nearly constant
total UV luminosity density up to z~6, under-predict the observed UV luminosity
density at Z<25 and over-predicts the I<27.2 one. This behaviour can be
understood in term of a poor match to the slope of the UV luminosity function.

sources of cosmic rays, it is only recently that X-ray observations have
identified several shell-type SNRs dominated by nonthermal emission, thus
revealing shock-accelerated electrons with energies extending far beyond the
typical thermal spectrum. Two of these SNRs have been detected as sources of
VHE gamma-rays.In other remnants, discrepancies between the shock velocity and
the electron temperature point to a strong cosmic ray component that has
thrived at the expense of the thermal gas. Modeling of the radio, X-ray, and
gamma-ray emission provides constraints on particle acceleration as well as the
properties of the medium in which the mechanism prospers.
  Crab-like pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are characterized by a termination shock
at which the wind is forced to join the slow expansion of the outer nebula.
These shocks also act as sites in which particles are boosted to high energies;
the X-ray emission from the Crab Nebula, as well as the inverse Compton
radiation observed as VHE gamma-rays, imply electrons with energies in excess
of ~100 TeV. Recent X-ray observations have begun to reveal these shock zones
in the Crab and other PWNe, and are now allowing us to constrain the nature of
pulsar winds as well as the flow conditions in the outer nebulae. Here I
present a brief overview of recent studies with the Chandra X-ray Observatory

analytically transport through a double barrier structure in a one-dimensional
system. Focusing on the case of weakly interacting electrons, we investigate
thoroughly the dependence of the conductance on the strength and the shape of
the double barrier for arbitrary temperature T. Our approach allows us to
systematically analyze the contributions to renormalized scattering amplitudes
from different characteristic scales absent in the case of a single impurity,
without restricting the consideration to the model of a single resonant level.
Both a sequential resonant tunneling for high T and a resonant transmission for
T smaller than the resonance width are studied within the unified treatment of
transport through strong barriers. For weak barriers, we show that two
different regimes are possible. Moderately weak impurities may get strong due
to a renormalization by interacting electrons, so that transport is described
in terms of theory for initially strong barriers. The renormalization of very
weak impurities does not yield any peak in the transmission probability;
however, remarkably, the interaction gives rise to a sharp peak in the
conductance, provided asymmetry is not too high.

reactions macroscopic fluctuations is studied. The issue is viewed with respect
to the necessary conditions for a long-term stable evolution of any natural and
artificial system. It is shown that global coupling of the local fluctuations
is necessary for providing a long-term stability of the system. A successful
coupling mechanism is achieved on the grounds of new assumptions about the
Hamiltonian response to certain perturbations. The coupling mechanism acts
towards a global synchronisation, i.e. to a coherent response of the excited
species to any further perturbation. It is proven that the synchronisation is a
scale-free process that has universal properties, e.g. it is insensitive to the
chemical identity of the reacting species and to the particularities of the
surface reaction. Its hallmark is that the global adsorption rate exhibits
permanent temporal variations whose amplitude is independent of the system
size.
  The presence of these fluctuations fundamentally changes the temporal
behavior of the system, namely it becomes pulse-like both on the quantum and
the macro-level. The pulse-like behavior gives rise to a persistent continuous
band at the quantum spectra whose major properties are: (I) it does not
correspond to any real radiation; (ii) its presence is insensitive to the
particularities of the system and the incident radiation; (iii) its shape and
the infrared edge are typical for the -type noise. These properties give rise
to its name: alias -type noise.

the free energy and energy density at the Gaussian upper borderline dimension

1-\alpha-\nu=(d-3)/2 of the Gaussian surface energy density. The latter has a
cusp-like singularity in d>3 dimensions. We show that these properties are the

an unexpected non-logarithmic violation of finite-size scaling for the

revisit Fisher's mapping of two dimensional Ising models to hardcore dimer
models. First, we note that the symmetry breaking transition of the
ferromagetic Ising model maps onto a non-symmetry breaking transition in dimer
language -- instead it becomes a deconfinement transition for test monomers.
Next, we introduce a modification of Fisher's mapping in which a second dimer
model, also equivalent to the Ising model, is defined on a generically
different lattice derived from the dual. In contrast to Fisher's original
mapping, this enables us to reformulate frustrated Ising models as dimer models
with positive weights and we illustrate this by providing a new solution of the
fully frustrated Ising model on the square lattice. Finally, by means of the
modified mapping we show that a large class of three-dimensional Ising models
are precisely equivalent, in the time continuum limit, to particular quantum
dimer models. As Ising models in three dimensions are dual to Ising gauge
theories, this further yields an exact map between the latter and the quantum
dimer models. The paramagnetic phase in Ising language maps onto a deconfined,
topologically ordered phase in the dimer models. Using this set of ideas, we
also construct an exactly soluble quantum eight vertex model.

the self-avoiding walks, sequence dependence and excluded-volume interactions

biological networks, which are well-known to exhibit non poissonian degree
distribution. A node is added at each time step and is connected to the rest of
the graph by oriented edges emerging from older nodes. This leads to a
statistical asymmetry between incoming and outgoing edges. The law for the
number of new edges at each time step is fixed but arbitrary. Thermodynamical
behavior is expected when this law has a large time limit. Although (by
construction) the incoming degree distributions depend on this law, this is not
the case for most qualitative features concerning the size distribution of
connected components, as long as the law has a finite variance. As the variance
grows above 1/4, the average being <1/2, a giant component emerges, which
connects a finite fraction of the vertices. Below this threshold, the
distribution of component sizes decreases algebraically with a continuously
varying exponent. The transition is of infinite order, in sharp contrast with
the case of static graphs. The local-in-time profiles for the components of

temperature, which is constant throughout the substance. There is also a useful
quantity which acts like a {\it local temperatures} and it varies throughout
the substance. These quantities are closely related to counterparts found in
general relativity. A lattice model with long-range spin-spin coupling is
studied. This is compared with systems such as those encountered in general
relativity, and gravitating systems with Newtonian-type interactions. A
long-range lattice model is presented which can be seen as a black-hole analog.
One finds that the analog's temperature and entropy have many properties which
are found in black-holes. Finally, the entropy scaling behavior of a
gravitating perfect fluid of constant density is calculated. For weak

oscillating universes are also admitted for positive cosmological constant. We

results from the four LEP collaborations and the SLD collaboration which were
prepared for the 2002 summer conferences. Averages from Z resonance results are
derived for hadronic and leptonic cross sections, the leptonic forward-backward
asymmetries, the tau polarisation asymmetries, the b-bbar and c-cbar partial
widths and forward-backward asymmetries and the q-qbar charge asymmetry. Above
the Z resonance, averages are derived for di-fermion cross sections and
forward-backward asymmetries, photon-pair, W-pair, Z-pair, single-W and
single-Z cross sections, electroweak gauge boson couplings, W mass and width
and W decay branching ratios. The main changes with respect to the experimental
results presented in summer 2001 are updates to the Z-pole heavy flavour
results from SLD and LEP, and new combinations of results above the Z pole. A
new investigation of the interference of photon and Z-boson exchange is
presented. For the first time, colour reconnection and Bose-Einstein
correlation analyses in W-pair production are combined.
  The results are compared with precise electroweak measurements from other
experiments, notably the recent final result on the electroweak mixing angle
determined in neutrino-nucleon scattering by the NuTeV collaboration. The
parameters of the Standard Model are evaluated, first using the combined LEP
electroweak measurements, and then using the full set of electroweak results.

paper we describe the setup developed to test the ZEUS MVD sensors and the

Consistent algebras are obtained by promoting $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ to an
anti-symmetric tensor operator ${\hat\theta}^{\mu\nu}$. The simplest among them
is Doplicher-Fredenhagen-Roberts (DFR) algebra in which the triple commutator
among the coordinate operators is assumed to vanish. This allows us to define
the Lorentz-covariant operator fields on the DFR algebra as operators diagonal
in the 6-dimensional $\theta$-space of the hermitian operators,
${\hat\theta}^{\mu\nu}$. It is shown that we then recover Carlson-Carone-Zobin
(CCZ) formulation of the Lorentz-invariant non-commutative gauge theory with no
need of compactification of the extra 6 dimensions. It is also pointed out that
a general argument concerning the normalizability of the weight function in the
Lorentz metric leads to a division of the $\theta$-space into two disjoint
spaces not connected by any Lorentz transformation so that the CCZ covariant
moment formula holds true in each space, separately. A non-commutative
generalization of Connes' two-sheeted Minkowski space-time is also proposed.
Two simple models of quantum field theory are reformulated on $M_4\times Z_2$

experimental campaign, performed by ESA, have been processed. An innovative
algorithm called Parfait, developed by Starlab and implemented within Starlab's
GNSS-R Software package STARLIGHT (STARLab Interferometric Gnss Toolkit), has
been successfully used with this set of data. A comparison with tide values
independently collected and with differential GPS processed data has been
performed. We report a successful PARIS phase altimetric measure of the Zeeland
Brug over the sea surface with a rapidly changing tide, with a precision better
than 2 cm.

  chiral isotropic media",,,"10.1103/PhysRevA.67.043821",,"quant-ph",,"  Using first principles, it is demonstrated that radiative damping alone
cannot lead to a nonvanishing electro-optic effect in a chiral isotropic
medium. This conclusion is in contrast with that obtained by a calculation in
which damping effects are included using the standard phenomenological model.
We show that these predictions differ because the phenomenological damping
equations are valid only in regions where the frequencies of the applied
electromagnetic fields are nearly resonant with the atomic transitions. We also
show that collisional damping can lead to a nonvanishing electrooptic effect,
but with a strength sufficiently weak that it is unlikely to be observable
under realistic laboratory conditions.

too precise to be represented by products of local quantum states. We show that
this limit of precision for the local quantum states of a pair of N-level
systems can be defined by an appropriate class of uncertainty relations. The
violation of such local uncertainty relations may be used as an experimental
test of entanglement generation.

the fact that the measurement outcome probabilities for the values of such

preparations. Some general implications of the norm-1-property are
investigated. As case studies, localization observables, phase observables, and
phase space observables are considered.

coupling - which is classically a chaotic system. We compare Poincar\'e
sections obtained from the quantum action with those from the classical action.
