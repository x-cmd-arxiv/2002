sigma_8=0.65-1.2 when COBE normalized. We also study a more extreme, warm dark
matter-like spectrum that is sharply truncated below a scale of 10^10 h^-1
Msun. We show that the mass fraction of halo substructure is not a strong
function of spectral slope, so it likely will be difficult to constrain tilt
using flux ratios of gravitationally lensed quasars. On the positive side, all
of our CDM-type models yield projected mass fractions in good agreement with
strong lensing estimates: f \sim 1.5% at M \sim 10^8 Msun. The truncated model
produces a significantly smaller fraction, f \lsim 0.3%, suggesting that warm
dark matter-like spectra may be distinguished from CDM spectra using lensing.
We also discuss the issue of dwarf satellite abundances, with emphasis on the
cosmological dependence of the map between the observed central velocity
dispersion of Milky Way satellites and the maximum circular velocities of their
host halos. In agreement with earlier work, we find that standard LCDM
over-predicts the estimated count of Milky Way satellites at fixed Vmax by an
order of magnitude, but tilted models do better because subhalos are less
concentrated. Interestingly, under the assumption that dwarfs have isotropic
velocity dispersion tensors, models with significantly tilted spectra (n \lsim
0.85, sigma_8 \lsim 0.7) may under-predict the number of large Milky Way
satellites with Vmax \gsim 40 km/s.

The hadronic phase including hyperons and Bose-Einstein condensate of $K^-$
mesons is described by the relativistic field theoretical model with density
dependent meson-baryon couplings. The early appearance of hyperons and/or
Bose-Einstein condensate of $K^-$ mesons delays the onset of phase transition
to higher density. In the presence of hyperons and/or $K^-$ condensate, the
overall equations of state become softer resulting in smaller maximum masses
than the cases without hyperons and $K^-$ condensate. We find that the maximum
mass neutron stars may contain a mixed phase core of hyperons, $K^-$ condensate
and color superconducting quark matter. Depending on the parameter space, we
also observe that there is a stable branch of superdense stars called the third

those of the neutron star branch. Our results are compared with the recent

in the framework of the particle physics theory, where is a mass shell
conception and then transitions (oscillations) between neutrinos with equal
masses are real and between neutrinos with different masses are virtual. It is
necessary to solve the question: which type of neutrino transitions
(oscillations) is realized in nature? There can be three types of neutrino
transitions (oscillations). At present it is considered that Dirac and Majorana
neutrino oscillations can be realized. It is shown that we cannot put Majorana
neutrinos in the standard weak interactions theory without violation of the
gauge invariance. Then it is obvious that there can be only realized
transitions (oscillations) between Dirac neutrinos with different flowers. Also
it is shown that the mechanism of resonance enhancement of neutrino
oscillations in matter cannot be realized without violation of the law of
energy-momentum conservation. Though it is supposed that we see neutrino
oscillations in experiments, indeed there only transitions between neutrinos
are registered. In order to register neutrino oscillations it is necessary to
see second or even higher neutrino oscillation modes in experiments. For this
purpose we can use the elliptic character of the Earth orbit. The analysis
shows that the SNO experimental results do not confirm smallest of nu_e to
nu_\tau transition angle mixings, which was obtained in CHOOZ experiment. It is
also noted that there is contradiction between SNO, Super-Kamiokande, Homestake

examined in D-dimensional flat spacetimes. First the plane wave solutions are
analyzed; then the wave generation is studied with the solution for the metric

Due to the difficulties in handling the wave tails in odd dimensions we
concentrate our study in even dimensions. We compute the metric quantities in
the wave zone in terms of the energy momentum tensor at retarded time. Some
special cases of interest are studied: first the slow motion approximation,
where the $D$-dimensional quadrupole formula is deduced. Within the quadrupole
approximation, we consider two cases of interest, a particle in circular orbit
and a particle falling radially into a higher dimensional Schwarzschild black
hole. Then we turn our attention to the gravitational radiation emitted during
collisions lasting zero seconds, i.e., hard collisions. We compute the
gravitational energy radiated during the collision of two point particles, in
terms of a cutoff frequency. In the case in which at least one of the particles
is a black hole, we argue this cutoff frequency should be close to the lowest
gravitational quasinormal frequency. In this context, we compute the scalar
quasinormal frequencies of higher dimensional Schwarzschild black holes.
Finally, as an interesting new application of this formalism, we compute the
gravitational energy release during the quantum process of black hole pair
creation. These results might be important in light of the recent proposal that
there may exist extra dimensions in the Universe, one consequence of which may
be black hole creation at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

disadvantages of the standard approach, new handy recursion formulae with the
same simple form both for ground and excited states have been obtained. As an
example, the perturbation expansions for the energy eigenvalues for the
Hulth\'en potential containing the vector part as well as the scalar component
are considered.

natures, we propose a theoretical scheme to observe the loss of quantum
coherence through coupling such qubit system to an engineered reservoir, the
harmonic oscillator mode in the LC circuit formed by the inductor and the
separated capacitors. Similar to the usual cavity QED system in form, this
charge qubit system with engineered couplings shows the quantum jumps (C.P.Sun
et al Fortschr. Phys. \textbf{43}, 585 (1995))in a progressive decoherence
process. Corresponding to two components of superposition of two charge states,
the inductor evolves simultaneously towards two distinct quasi-classical states
entangling with two states of the charge qubit. Then it induces the quantum
decoherence for the induced squeezing macroscopically in the LC mode.
