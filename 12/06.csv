outer blast wave shock surrounding a central bright region of reverse-shock
heated ejecta. The abundances of the outer shock are consistent with LMC
values, while the ejecta region shows enhanced abundances of Si, Fe, and other
species. However, oxygen is not enhanced in the ejecta; the Fe/O abundance
ratio there is more than 5 times the solar ratio. Based on the relative
positions of the blast wave shock and the contact discontinuity in the context
of SNR evolutionary models, we determine a total ejecta mass of approximately
1.5 solar masses. Ejecta mass estimates based on emission measures derived from
spectral fits are subject to considerable uncertainty due to lack of knowledge
of the true contribution of hydrogen continuum emission. Maximal mass
estimates, i.e., assuming no hydrogen, result in 1.5 solar masses of Fe and
0.24 solar masses of Si. Under the assumption that an equal quantity of
hydrogen has been mixed into the ejecta, we estimate 0.8 solar masses of Fe and
0.12 solar masses of Si. These characteristics support the view that in DEM L71
we see Fe-rich ejecta from a Type Ia SN several thousand years after explosion.

decouples from the isocurvature perturbations if the background fields'

both emissions originate in shocks from supernova explosions. We find a spatial

corresponding halos in the 32 Mpc simulation that have masses, M_{dm}, typical

the halos in the 256 Mpc box are consistent with having steeper cores than the
corresponding halos in the 32 Mpc simulation, but higher mass resolution
simulations are needed to strengthen this result. Combined, these results
indicate that the density profile of DM halos is not universal, presenting
shallower cores in dwarf galaxies and steeper cores in clusters. Physically the
result sustains the hypothesis that the mass function of the accreting
satellites determines the inner slope of the DM profile. In comoving
coordinates, r, the profile \rho_{dm} \propto 1/(X^\alpha(1+X)^{3-\alpha}),

H-band selected galaxies with apparent magnitudes 17<=H<=20 from the Las

with an RMS dispersion between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts of
\sigma_z/(1+z)~0.08. Using galaxies identified in the Hubble Deep Field South

that the systematic uncertainty inherent in the luminosity function
measurements due to uncertainties in photometric redshifts is non-negligible
and therefore must be accounted for. We then develop a technique to correct for
this systematic error by incorporating the redshift error functions of
individual galaxies in the luminosity function analysis. The redshift error
functions account for the non-gaussian characteristics of photometric redshift
uncertainties. They are the products of a convolution between the corresponding
redshift likelihood functions of individual galaxies and a Gaussian
distribution function that characterizes template-mismatch variance. We
demonstrate, based on a Monte Carlo simulation, that we are able to completely
recover the bright end of the intrinsic galaxy luminosity function using this
technique. Finally, we calculate the luminosity function separately for the

responsible for neutron-capture synthesis and the progenitors of the halo
stars, were rapidly evolving. Abundance comparisons among large numbers of
stars provide clues about the nature of neutron-capture element synthesis both
during the earliest times and throughout the history of the Galaxy. In
particular, these comparisons suggest differences in the way the heavier
(including Ba and above) and lighter neutron capture elements are synthesized
in nature. Understanding these differences will help to identify the
astrophysical site (or sites) of and conditions in the r-process. The abundance
comparisons also demonstrate a large star-to-star scatter in the
neutron-capture/iron ratios at low metallicities- which disappears with
increasing [Fe/H]- and suggests an early, chemically unmixed and inhomogeneous
Galaxy. The very recent neutron-capture element observations indicate that the
early phases of Galactic nucleosynthesis, and the associated chemical
evolution, are quite complex, with the yields from different (progenitor)
mass-range stars contributing to different chemical mixes. Stellar abundance
comparisons suggest a change from the r-process to the slow neutron capture
(i.e., s-) process at higher metallicities (and later times) in the Galaxy.

or strongly interacting systems like HR10. Using Bruzual & Charlot SED models,
we investigated population differences in EROs selected by their (I-K) vs.
(R-K) colors and found that I-band based surveys preferentially select systems
with prolonged star formation. Real differences in the surface densities of
EROs in R-band and I-band based surveys may reflect this color selection
effect, complicating the comparisons between and interpretations on the nature
of the ERO population. <Abstract truncated>

extended filamentary emission bounded by edge-brightened rims. The source is
offset on one side of symmetrically distributed X-ray emission that is centered
on the dominant cluster galaxy NGC 5419. PKS B1400-33 is a rare example of a

  The diffuse source appears to have had an unusual origin and we discuss
possible mechanisms. We examine whether the source could be re-energized relic
radio plasma or a buoyant synchrotron bubble that is a relic of activity in NGC
5419. The more exciting prospect is that the source is relic plasma preserved
in the cluster gaseous environment following the chance injection of a radio

from the metastable (J, K) = (3, 3) state has been tentatively detected for the
first time in the interstellar medium, where previous observations of H3+ had
been limited to absorption lines from the lowest levels: (J, K) = (1, 0) of

takes place in dense and diffuse clouds along the line of sight as well as the
molecular complex close to the Galactic nucleus. At least four kinematic
components are found in the H3+ absorption lines. We suggest identifications of
the velocity components with those of HI, CO, and H2CO previously reported from
radio and infrared observations. H3+ components with velocities that match
those of weak and sharp CO and H2CO lines are attributed to diffuse clouds. Our
observation has revealed a striking difference between the absorption profiles

complementary to that obtained from CO spectroscopy. The tentative detection of
the R(3, 3)^l line and the non-detection of spectral lines from other J > 1

gravitational and magnetic instabilities as a source of turbulence.
Gravitational instabilities are pervasive in a multi-phase medium, even for
sub-threshold column densities, suggesting that only an ISM with a pure-warm
phase can stop star formation. The instabilities generate turbulence, and this
turbulence influences the structure and timing of star formation through its
effect on the gas distribution and density. The final trigger for star
formation is usually direct compression by another star or cluster. The star
formation rate is apparently independent of the detailed mechanisms for star
formation, and determined primarily by the total mass of gas in a dense form.
If the density distribution function is a log-normal, as suggested by
turbulence simulations, then this dense gas mass can be calculated and the star
formation rate determined from first principles. The results suggest that only
10**(-4) of the ISM mass actively participates in the star formation process
and that this fraction does so because its density is larger than 10**5 cm-3,
at which point several key processes affecting dynamical equilibrium begin to
break down.

make the right choice of E(t) so as to obtain symmetry breaking which causes
directed energy transport for systems with a nonzero topological charge. Their
numerical simulations verified the existence of the directed energy current. We
use a rigorous collective variable for nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations to
prove the rectification of the current is due to the excitation of an internal
mode, $\Gamma(t)$, which describes the oscillation of the slope of the kink.
The internal mode $\Gamma(t)$ is excited by its interaction with the center of
mass of the kink, X(t), which is accelerated by E(t). The external field E(t)
also causes the kink to be dressed, which affects the shape of the kink and
modulates the interaction of $\Gamma(t)$ with X(t). However, we show that the
dressing in the absence of excitation of the internal mode $\Gamma(t)$ cannot
cause a directed energy current. We derive the expressions for the dressing and
numerically solve the equations of motion for $\Gamma(t)$, X(t), and the
momentum, P(t), which enable us to obtain the explicit expressions for the
directed energy current and the ac driven kink profile. We then show the

percolation clusters in two and three dimensions, using a combination of
extremal statistics arguments and exact numerical computations, for power-law
distributed bond strengths of the type $P(\sigma) \sim \sigma^{-\alpha}$.
Assuming that only cutting bonds determine the flow, the maxflow critical
exponent $\ve$ is found to be $\ve(\alpha)=(d-1) \nu + 1/(1-\alpha)$. This
prediction is confirmed with excellent accuracy using large-scale numerical
simulation in two and three dimensions. However, in the region of anomalous
bond capacity distributions ($0\leq \alpha \leq 1$) we demonstrate that, due to
cluster-structure fluctuations, it is not the cutting bonds but the blobs that
set the transport properties of the backbone. This ``blob-dominance'' avoids a
cross-over to a regime where structural details, the distribution of the number
of red or cutting bonds, would set the scaling. The restored scaling exponents
however still follow the simplistic red bond estimate. This is argued to be due
to the existence of a hierarchy of so-called minimum cut-configurations, for
which cutting bonds form the lowest level, and whose transport properties scale
all in the same way. We point out the relevance of our findings to other scalar
transport problems (i.e. conductivity).

Chiral Perturbation Theory appears to rule this scenario out. However, the
Kaplan-Manohar ambiguity demonstrates that certain strong next-to-leading order

calculation of the Gasser-Leutwyler coefficient combination 2 L_8 - L_5 can

next-to-leading order in the 1/N expansion. In particular, a new expression is
obtained for the effective potential which is explicitly invariant under
renormalization group transformations. The model is used as a playground to
investigate various features of field theory at finite temperature. For example
we verify that, as expected from general arguments, the cancellation of
ultraviolet divergences takes place at finite temperature without the need for
introducing counterterms beyond those of zero-temperature. As well known, the
discrete chiral symmetry of the 1+1 dimensional model is spontaneously broken
at zero temperature and restored, in leading order, at some temperature T_c; we
find that the 1/N approximation breaks down for temperatures below T_c: As the
temperature increases, the fluctuations become eventually too large to be
treated as corrections, and a Landau pole invalidates the calculation of the
effective potential in the vicinity of its minimum. Beyond T_c, the 1/N
expansion becomes again regular: it predicts that in leading order the system
behaves as a free gas of massless fermions and that, at the next-to-leading
order, it remains weakly interacting. In the limit of large temperature, the
pressure coincides with that given by perturbation theory with a coupling
constant defined at a scale of the order of the temperature, as expected from
asymptotic freedom.

on factorization formalism in QCD. We evaluate the forward diffractive
production cross section in perturbative QCD in terms of the light-cone wave
functions of Z boson and \eta_{c,b} mesons, and the gluon distribution of the
nucleon. The diffractive production of \eta_c is governed by the axial vector
coupling of the longitudinally polarized Z boson to Q\bar{Q} pair, and the
resulting \eta_c production cross section is larger than the J/\psi one by one
order of magnitude. The bottomonium \eta_b production, which shows up for
higher beam energy, is also discussed.

treat the endpoint region of Upsilon -> X gamma decay within the framework of
the soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). Within this approach the Upsilon
structure function arises naturally, and kinematic logarithms are summed by
running operators using renormalization group equations. In a previous paper we
studied the color-octet contribution to the decay. Here we treat the
color-singlet contribution. We combine our result with previous results to

nuclear physics. This means to identify the areas where nuclear physics will be
expanding in the next future. In six chapters a short overview of these areas
will be given, where I expect that nuclear physics willdevelop quite fast: A.
Quantum Chromodynamics and effective field theories in the confinement region;
B. Nuclear structure at the limits; C. High energy heavy ion collisions; D.
Nuclear astrophysics; E. Neutrino physics; F. Test of physics beyond the
standard model by rare processes. After a survey over these six points I will
pick out a few topics where I will go more in details. There is no time to give
for all six points detailed examples. I shall discuss the following examples of
the six topics mentionned above: 1. The perturbative chiral quark model and the
nucleon $\Sigma$-term, 2. VAMPIR (Variation After Mean field Projection In
Realistic model spaces and with realistic forces) as an example of the nuclear
structure renaissance, 3. Measurement of important astrophysical nuclear
reactions in the Gamow peak, 4. The solar neutrino problem. As examples for
testing new physics beyond the standard model by rare processes I had prepared
to speak about the measurement of the electric neutron dipole moment and of the
neutrinoless double beta decay. But the time is limited and so I have to skip
these points, although they are extremely interesting.

constructs all the laws from the Hamilton principle, also called action
principle. According to this principle all systems are characterized by a
magnitude called action which variation is equal to zero for the real evolution
of the systems. At first, do not exist restrictions for the mathematical form
of the action function, nonetheless, as in the a posteriori developer of the
analytic physics, the traditional equations of the physics lead up to a scalar
action, it is always sure that the action may be a scalar function. In this
article we propose the existence of a tensorial function like origin of the
traditional scalar action. First because it permits, without other argumens, to
justify the own action principle and second because it permits connect the
complementary principle of the Quantum physics with the analytic expressions of
the nonquantum physics, including the General Relativity. We call tensorial
action to this original function and their components are connecting, directly,
with the tensorial (spinorial) componets of the wave function of the particles
with spin higher than zero. For this reason we can understand why in the
nonquantum physics only has significance a scalar action.
