self-similar scaling of galaxy systems, L_B \propto T^{1.6 +/- 0.2}. The
self-similar form and continuity of the L_B : T relation from clusters to

formation efficiency is rather similar in all these systems. We find that the
bright extended X-ray components associated with many central galaxies in

addition we find that the optical light in these groups appears to be more
centrally concentrated than the light in clusters. We also use the optical and
X-ray data to investigate whether early or late type galaxies are primarily
responsible for preheating in groups. Using three different methods, we
conclude that spiral galaxies appear to play a comparable role to early types
in the preheating of the intragroup medium. This tends to favour models in
which the preheating arises primarily from galaxy winds rather than AGN, and
implies that spirals have played a significant role in the metal enrichment of

which corrects the group data for the effects of projection and for the
expected higher merging rate in groups, brings the morphology-density relation
into good agreement with that of clusters, suggesting that the relation may be
driven by two-body interactions. The fraction of S0 galaxies in these X-ray

rate using the current observed sample, and we find calculate the most likely

(scaling with the HI distribution) or a rotating triaxial dark halo as
alternative solutions. In an attempt to explore these mechanisms,
hydrodynamical simulations were run for each case and compared to observations
using customized column density and kinematic constraints. The spiral structure
can be accounted for both by an unseen bar or triaxial halo, the former fitting
the observations slightly better. However, the large bar mass or halo pattern
frequency required make it unlikely that the spiral wave is driven by an
external perturber. In particular, the spin parameter is much higher than
predicted by current cold dark matter (CDM) structure formation scenarios. The
massive disk models show that when the observed gas surface density is scaled
up by a factor about 10, the disk develops a spiral structure resembling
closely the observed one, in perturbed density as well as perturbed velocity.
This is consistent with more limited studies in other galaxies and suggests
that the disk of NGC 2915 contains much more mass than is visible, tightly
linked to the neutral hydrogen. A classic (quasi-)spherical halo is
nevertheless still required, as increasing the disk mass further to fit the
circular velocity curve would make the disk violently unstable. Scaling the
observed surface density profile by an order of magnitude brings the disk and
halo masses to comparable values within the disk radius.

other hand, stellar rotation might play a crucial role in triggering powerful
stellar winds, once the (Omega-Gamma)-limit is approached. However, this
critical condition of intense mass loss can be maintained just for short, as
the loss of angular momentum due to mass ejection quickly leads to the spinning
down of the star. As by-product to the present work, the wind chemical yields

on a comparison of numbe counts of ORS galaxies with those of the spectroscopic
sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Early Data Release (EDR). We
carefully count galaxies in the same absolute magnitude bin from the two
samples. We find a slight systematic overestimate of the ORS counts outside
5000 km s$^{-1}$ by about a factor of 2. We revise the selection function of
the ORS assuming that the SDSS counts are correct. Our revision is based on the
absorption given in the ORS catalog as well as that computed from Schlegel et
al. (1998), which is systematically larger than the former by $A_B \sim 0.1$
mag in the region of low absorption. It is found that introduction of Schlegel
et al.'s absorption changes one of the parameters of the ORS selection function
by more than 10%. The revision should be taken into account in the future
analysis of the source number density of UHECRs based on the ORS. Using the
revised selection function, we determine the global structure of the Local
Supercluster (LSC) with a source model of UHECRs, that is, a number-density
model consisting of a uniform spherical halo and an exponential disk. We find
that the revision is insignificant in terms of the structure of the LSC.

peculiar velocity and correlation function.

number Pm of order of 10^-5 and an uniform axial magnetic field. The sign of
the constant a in the basic rotation law \Omega=a+b/R^2 strongly influences the
presented results. It is negative for resting outer cylinder. The main point
here is that the subcritical excitation which occurs for large Pm disappears
for small Pm. This is the reason that the existence of the magnetorotational
instability remained unknown over decades. For rotating outer cylinder the
limiting case a=0 plays an exceptional role. The hydromagnetic instability
exists with certain Reynolds numbers at certain Hartmann numbers of the
magnetic field. These Reynolds numbers exactly scale with Pm^-1/2 resulting in
moderate values of order 10^4 for Pm=10^-5. However, already for the smallest
positive value of a the Reynolds numbers start to scale as 1/Pm leading to much
higher values of order 10^6 for Pm=10^-5. Also nonaxisymmetric modes have been
considered. With vacuum boundary conditions their excitation is always more
difficult than the excitation of axisymmetric modes; we never observed a
crossover of the lines of marginal stability. For conducting walls, however,
such crossovers exist for both resting and rotating outer cylinders, and this
might be essential for future dynamo experiments.

shifted to the detailed properties of these systems. Nature has provided us
with an extremely useful probe of the region very close to an accreting black
hole - X-ray irradiation of relatively cold material in the vicinity of the
black hole can imprint characteristic features into the X-ray spectra of black
hole systems, most notably the Kalpha fluorescent line of iron. Detailed X-ray
spectroscopy of these features can be used to study Doppler and gravitational
redshifts, thereby providing key information on the location and kinematics of
the cold material. This is a powerful tool that allows us to probe within a few
gravitational radii, or less, of the event horizon. Here, we present a
comprehensive review of relativistic iron line studies for both accreting
stellar mass black holes (i.e., Galactic Black Hole Candidate systems; GBHCs),
and accreting supermassive black holes (i.e., active galactic nuclei; AGN).
After a pedagogical introduction to black hole astrophysics, we discuss studies
of relativistic iron lines in the AGN context and show how differences between
classes of AGN can be diagnosed using X-ray spectroscopy. Furthermore, through
a detailed discussion of one particular object (MCG--6-30-15), we illustrate
how the exotic physics of black hole spin are now open to observational study.
We proceed to discuss GBHCs, which turn out to possess rather more complicated
X-ray spectra, making robust conclusions more difficult to draw. However, even
in these cases, modern X-ray observatories are now providing convincing
evidence for relativistic effects. We conclude by discussing the science that
can be addressed by future X-ray observatories.

$\sim$1 solar within 2$'$, which is close to stellar abundance within the same

of Galactic stars. The observed Mg/O ratio is about 1.25 solar, which is also
the same ratio as for Galactic stars. The O/Si/Fe ratio indicates that the SN

electron-electron scattering in a mean-field approximation. With this theory we

a robust dark matter signal, since it would give a quasi-monotonic gamma ray.
This process is radiatively-induced, and the full-one loop calculation was done
previously. However, for the heavy wino-like or Higgsino-like neutralino, the
one-loop cross section violates unitarity, therefore the higher-order
corrections may be important. We construct a non-relativistic theory for
chargino and neutralino two-body states, and estimate all-order QED corrections
and two-loop corrections by $Z$ and/or $W$ exchange. We find that the critical
mass, above that the two-loop contribution is larger than one-loop one, is
about 8 TeV (O(10) TeV) in the limit where neutralino is wino (Higgsino)-like,
respectively. Around and above the critical mass, the all-order Z and/or W
exchange must be included to estimate the cross section. On the other hand, the
QED corrections depend on the mass difference between the neutralino and
chargino. In the wino-like limit where neutralino is highly degenerate with
chargino in mass, we find that QED corrections enhance the pair annihilation
cross section by 1.5-2.

It is shown that transversity can be measured in the above processes, in
connection with three different fragmentation functions: the first one requires
the observation of an unpolarized final state hadron with transverse momentum
(Collins function), the second requires the observation of the interference
between the s- and p-wave production of two hadrons, the third requires the
observation of pure p-wave two-hadron production, or equivalently of a spin-one
resonance. All these fragmentation functions fall in the category of T-odd
fragmentation functions: they require the presence of final state interactions,
or else they are forbidden by time-reversal invariance. The last part of the
thesis looks at the possibility of modeling this kind of fragmentation
functions and investigates whether they can be large enough to allow the

as well as the day-night asymmetries in the flux of neutrinos from the Sun in
the charged-current (CC), neutral-current (NC) and elastic scattering (ES)
channels. Motivated by the small but negative day-night asymmetry in the NC
channel at SNO (1.2 standard deviations away from zero), we consider whether
such a non-zero asymmetry can be generated in a framework where active
neutrinos can both oscillate and decay, since the NC day-night asymmetry is
zero in a frame-work that includes pure oscillations of active flavours. We
find that the neutral current day-night asymmetry is strictly zero when we
include both oscillations and decay. The result holds for arbitrary number of
active neutrino species, with some reasonable assumptions on the decay
parameters. Hence, a non-zero asymmetry in the neutral current sector, if it
survives, can only come from oscillations/decay into sterile flavours. We also
examine the allowed region of parameter space coming from a combined analysis
of the total event rates in the charged-current, neutral current and elastic
scattering sectors in a two-flavour framework, and find that the neutral
current rates are most sensitive to (and hence restrict considerably) the
allowed values of the decay parameter involving the life-time of the heavier
mass eigenstate to $\tau_{2_0} > 10^{-4}$ s for eV mass neutrinos.

collisions is cross-talk between the partons from different nucleons in the

distribution functions obtained from deep inelastic lepton-hadron scattering
and by the nuclear geometry; it increases with increasing $A$ and/or $\sqrt s$.
In the transverse collision plane, this results in clusters of overlapping
partons, and at some critical density, the cluster size suddenly reaches the
size of the system. The onset of large-scale cross-talk through color
connection thus occurs as geometric critical behavior. Percolation theory
specifies the details of this transition, which leads to the formation of a
condensate of deconfined partons. Given sufficient time, this condensate could
eventually thermalize. However, already the onset of parton condensation in the
initial state, without subsequent thermalization, leads to a number of
interesting observable consequences.

this scenario, the energy density stored in the modes of trans-Planckian
wave-numbers but sub-Hubble frequencies produced by amplification of the vacuum
quantum fluctuations would account naturally for the dark energy. The present
article examines this model in detail and shows step by step that it does not
work. In particular, we show that this model cannot make definite predictions
since there is no well-defined vacuum state in the region of wave-numbers
considered, hence the initial data cannot be specified unambiguously. We also
show that for most choices of initial data this scenario implies the production
of a large amount of energy density (of order M_Planck^4) for modes with
momenta of order M_Planck, far in excess of the background energy density. We
evaluate the amount of fine-tuning in the initial data necessary to avoid this
back-reaction problem and find it is of order H/M_Planck. We also argue that
the equation of state of the trans-Planckian modes is not vacuum-like.
Therefore this model does not provide a suitable explanation for the dark
energy.

theory and justify our arguments by showing that the model not only yields the
correct value for the g-factor but also gives us the very small correction to
the magnetic moment as obtained in the renormalization programme of quantum
electrodynamics. The model also allows us to give a new meaning to the negative
energy state of an electron. The general outlines of the unified field theory
are given and the connection between fluctuations at the Planck and Compton

A67, 062318 (2003)","10.1103/PhysRevA.67.062318",,"quant-ph",,"  The ""pushing gate"" proposed by Cirac and Zoller in 2000 for quantum logic in
ion traps is discussed, in which a force is used to give a controlled push to a
pair of trapped ions and thus realize a phase gate. The original proposal had a
weakness in that it involved a hidden extreme sensitivity to the size of the
force. Also, the physical origin of this force was not fully addressed. Here,
we discuss the sensitivity and present a way to avoid it by choosing the
spatial form of the pushing force in an optimal way. We also analyse the effect
of imperfections in a pair of pi pulses which are used to implement a
""spin-echo"" to cancel correlated errors. We present a physical model for the
force, namely the dipole force, and discuss the impact of unwanted photon
scattering, and of finite temperature of the ions. The main effect of the
temperature is to blur the phase of the gate owing to the ions exploring a
range of values of the force. When the distance scale of the force profile is
smaller than the ion separation, this effect is more important than the
high-order terms in the Coulomb repulsion which were originally discussed.
Overall, we find that whereas the ""pushing gate"" is not as resistant to
imperfections as was supposed, it remains a significant candidate for ion trap
quantum computing since it does not require ground state cooling, and in some
cases it does not require the Lamb-Dicke limit, while the gate rate is fast,
close to (rather than small compared to) the trap vibrational frequency.

the statistical distinguishability of a given state with the closest

particular, we concentrate on the relative entropy of entanglement with

is strongly additive, thereby demonstrating that monotonicity under local
quantum operations and strong additivity are compatible in principle. In
accordance with the presented statistical interpretation which is provided,
this entanglement monotone, however, has the property that it diverges on pure
states, with the consequence that it cannot distinguish the degree of
entanglement of different pure states. We also prove that the relative entropy
of entanglement with respect to the set of disentangled states that have
identical reductions to the primary state is an entanglement monotone. We
finally investigate the trace-norm measure and demonstrate that it is also a
proper entanglement monotone.

to the question, whether one system in such an infinitely entangled state can
serve as a resource for tasks like the teleportation of arbitrarily many
qubits. We show that appropriate states cannot be obtained by density operators
in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. However, using techniques for the
description of infinitely many degrees of freedom from field theory and
statistical mechanics, such states can nevertheless be constructed rigorously.
We explore two related possibilities, namely an extended notion of algebras of
observables, and the use of singular states on the algebra of bounded
operators. As applications we construct the essentially unique infinite
analogue of maximally entangled states, and the singular state used
heuristically in the fundamental paper of Einstein, Rosen and Podolsky.
