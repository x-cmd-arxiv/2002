  ed. U. Munari, ASP Conf. Ser., in press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We argue that tracing star formation histories with ESA's space mission GAIA
using main sequence turn-off (MSTO) point dating will mainly be effective in
cases of mild interstellar extinction (E(B-V)<0.5). For higher reddenings the
MSTO approach will be severely limited both in terms of traceable ages (t<0.5
Gyr at 8 kpc; E(B-V)=1.0) and/or distances (d<2 kpc for t=15 Gyr; E(B-V)=1.0),
since the MSTO will be located at magnitudes too faint for GAIA. AGB stars may
alternatively provide precise population ages with GAIA for a wide range of
ages and metallicities, with traceable distances of up to 250 kpc at E(B-V)=0
(d=15 kpc if E(B-V)=2.0). It is essential however that effective temperatures
precise to 0.01 dex, metallicities to 0.2 dex, and E(B-V) to 0.03 are derived
for individual stars, in order to obtain their ages precise to 0.2 dex. This
task is quite challenging for GAIA photometry and spectroscopy, though
preliminary tests show that comparable precisions may be achieved with GAIA
medium band photometry.

in Universe. Here the effect of the rotation of the black hole to the
space-time is considered following an earlier work of the author, where the
pseudo-Newtonian potential was prescribed for the Kerr geometry. We show that,
with the inclusion of rotation of the black hole, the valid disk parameter
region dramatically changes and disk becomes unstable. Also we discuss about
the possibility of shock in accretion disk around rotating black holes. When
the black hole is chosen to be rotating, the sonic locations of the accretion
disk get shifted or disappear, making the disk unstable. To bring it in the
stable situation, the angular momentum of the accreting matter has to be
reduced/enhanced (for co/counter-rotating disk) by means of some physical
process.

that includes brownian motion, viscosity, and spring-like attractive and
repulsive forces. The particles can be assembled into patterns that can encode
arbitrary strings of bits. We demonstrate that, if an arbitrary ""seed"" pattern

This assumption is motivated by some recent work presenting the big-bang as a
higher dimensional shock wave. We show that this assumption, together with an
equation of state for the effective matter quantities in 4D, allows Einstein's
equations to be fully integrated. We then recover the familiar FLRW universes,
on the four-dimensional hypersurfaces orthogonal to the extra dimension.
Regarding the extra dimension we find that it is {\em growing} in size if the
universe is speeding up its expansion. We also get an estimate for the relative
change of the extra dimension over time. This estimate could have important

the expectation values depend on the initial state. Furthermore a procedure to
extend the Lindblad equation to an equation of motion for an ideal Bose 'gas'
of 'particles', i.e.systems with non-trivial internal structure, is described.
Initially in some quantum state, this collection of 'particles' will
asymptotically turn into an equilibrium ensemble whose probability distribution
is determined by the Lindblad operators building the dissipative part of the
equation of motion.

  Kevrekidis","Deciding the Nature of the ""Coarse Equation"" through Microscopic
  Simulations: the Baby-Bathwater Scheme","13 pages, 7 figures",,,,"physics.comp-ph",,"  Recent developments in multiscale computation allow the solution of ``coarse
equations'' for the expected macroscopic behavior of
microscopically/stochastically evolving particle distributions without ever
obtaining these coarse equations in closed form. The closure is obtained ``on
demand'' through appropriately initialized bursts of microscopic simulation.
The effective coupling of microscopic simulators with macrosocopic behavior
embodied in this approach requires certain decisions about the nature of the
unavailable ``coarse equation''. Such decisions include (a) the determination
of the highest spatial derivative active in the equation, (b) whether the
coarse equation satisfies certain conservation laws, and (c) whether the coarse
dynamics is Hamiltonian. These decisions affect the number and type of boundary
conditions as well as the nature of the algorithms employed in good solution
practice. In the absence of an explicit formula for the temporal derivative, we
propose, implement and validate a simple scheme for deciding these and other
similar questions about the coarse equation using only the microscopic
simulator. Microscopic simulations under periodic boundary conditions are
carried out for appropriately chosen families of random initial conditions;
evaluating the sample variance of certain statistics over the simulation
ensemble allows us to infer the highest order of spatial derivatives active in
the coarse equation. In the same spirit we show how to determine whether a
certain coarse conservation law exists or not, and we discuss plausibility
tests for the existence of a coarse Hamiltonian or integrability. We argue that
such schemes constitute an important part of the equation-free approach to
multiscale computation.
