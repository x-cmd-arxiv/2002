Abell clusters at $z<0.18$ increase with redshift. The increase is caused by
observational selection: the number of rich and large clusters is small in the
nearby small volume of space, while poor and small clusters are not detected at
high distances. Besides, the numbers of clusters with different ellipticities
are about the same at all distances, though in the case of cosmological
evolution the number of the more elliptical clusters increases with decrease of
distance. It means that clusters do not evolve dynamically. The dependences of
the X-ray emission detection rate and the temperature of the X-ray emission on
redshift are consequences of the dependence of $N_A$ on redshift. The radial
velocity dispersion of the less elliptical clusters is higher than that of the
elongated ones. This shows that galaxies in a cluster move preferentially along
the large axis of the cluster. The space density is not changing in the
considered range of $z$. Movement of galaxies along the cluster elongation may
be explained by rotation along the large axis of a cluster.

MeV/nuc and several PeV/nuc is strongly believed to be of diffusive nature. The
particles emitted by a source located in the disk do not pervade the whole
Galaxy, but are rather confined to a smaller region whose spatial extension is
related to the height of the diffusive halo, the Galactic wind and the
spallation rate. Following the pioneering work of Jones (1978), this paper
presents a general study on the spatial origin of cosmic rays, with a
particular attention to the role of spallations and Galactic wind. This
question is different, and to a certain extent disconnected, from that of the
origin of cosmic rays. We find the regions of the disk from which a given
fraction of cosmic rays detected in the Solar neighborhood were emitted
(f-surfaces). After a general study, we apply the results to a realistic source
distribution, with the propagation parameters obtained in our previous
systematic analysis of the observed secondary-to-primary ratios Maurin et al
(2002). The shape and size of these f-surfaces depend on the species as well as
on the values of the propagation parameters. For some of the models preferred
by our previous analysis (i.e. large diffusion slope $\delta$), these
f-surfaces are small and in some extreme cases only a fraction of a percent of
the whole Galactic sources actually contribute to the Solar neighborhood Cosmic
Ray flux. Moreover, a very small number of sources may be responsible for more
than 15 % of the flux detected in the Solar neighborhood. This may point
towards the necessity to go beyond the approximations of both homogeneity and
stationarity. Finally, the observed primary composition is dominated by sources
within a few kpc.

the cosmic rays detected in the Solar neighborhood, in the case of standard
sources located in the Galactic disk. There are some reasons to believe that
there may also be a large number of sources located in the halo, for example if
the Galactic dark matter is made of supersymmetric particles or if Primordial
Black Holes are present. These exotic sources could enhance the $\bar{p}$,
$\bar{d}$ or positrons above the standard background, indicating the existence
of new physics. The spatial distribution of these hypothetical sources, though
an important ingredient to evaluate these exotic signals, is poorly known. The
aim of this paper is to point out that this discussion should not be
disconnected from that of the propagation properties in the Galaxy. More
precisely, we determine the regions of the halo from which a significant
fraction f of cosmic rays antiprotons and antideuterons detected in the Solar
neighborhood were emitted (we refer to these regions as f-volumes), for
different sets of propagation parameters consistent with B/C data, as derived
in Maurin et al (2002). It is found that some of them lead to rather small
f-volumes, indicating that the exotic cosmic rays could have a local origin (in
particular for a small halo or a large Galactic convective wind), coming from
the solar neighborhood or the Galactic center region. It is also found that the
dark matter density enhancement (spike) due to the accretion around the central
supermassive black hole gives a negligible contribution to the exotic charged
particle signal on Earth. The case of electrons and positrons is also
discussed.

itself is a single cloud in thiscomplex, which could be a parcel of gas in a
galactic ISM. A spherical cloud of ~10 pc would be limited to one of the

the calibration of radio-derived and IR-derived star formation (SF) rates, and
the origin of the radio-IR correlation. By comparing the 8-1000 micron IR,
which samples dust-reprocessed starlight, with direct stellar FUV emission, I
show that the IR traces most of the SF in luminous L* galaxies but traces only
a small fraction of the SF in faint ~0.01 L* galaxies. If radio emission were a
perfect SF rate indicator, this effect would cause easily detectable curvature
in the radio-IR correlation. Yet, the radio-IR correlation is nearly linear.
This implies that the radio flux from low-luminosity galaxies is substantially
suppressed, compared to brighter galaxies. This is naturally interpreted in
terms of a decreasing efficiency of non-thermal radio emission in faint
galaxies. Thus, the linearity of the radio-IR correlation is a conspiracy: both
indicators underestimate the SF rate at low luminosities. SF rate calibrations
which take into account this effect are presented, along with estimates of the
random and systematic error associated with their use.

the [O II] 3727 doublet in both cases. The measured redshift of GRB 990506 is
the highest known for a dark burst GRB, though entirely consistent with the

relative strengths of the [O II], He I, [Ne III], and H gamma emission lines
suggest that the host of GRB 000418 is a starburst galaxy, rather than a LINER
or Seyfert 2. Since the host of GRB 000418 has been detected at sub-millimeter
wavelengths these spectroscopic observations suggest that the sub-millimeter

the Lyalpha optical depth decrease inside 1 Mpc/h of the galaxies by a factor
of ~2. We interpret this result as due to the combined effect of infall
occurring along the filaments, which prevents efficient halo gas clearing by
the outflow, and the insufficient increase of (collisional) hydrogen ionization
produced by the temperature increase inside the hot, outflow-carved bubble.
Unless an observational selection bias is present, we speculate that local

reaction rate uncertainties in a stellar nucleosynthesis and mixing context.
The method combines post-processing nucleosynthesis and mixing calculations
with a Monte Carlo scheme. With this approach we reanalyze the dependence of
theoretical oxygen isotopic ratio predictions in first dredge-up red giant
branch stars in a systematic way. Such predictions are important to the
interpretation of pre-solar Al_2 O_3 grains from meteorites. The reaction rates
with uncertainties were taken from the NACRE compilation (Angulo etal., 1999).
We include seven reaction rates in our systematic analysis of stellar models
with initial masses from 1 to 3 M_sun. We find that the uncertainty of reaction
rate for reaction O18(p,alpha)N15 typically causes an error in the theoretical
O16/O18 ratio of about +20/-5 per cent. The error of the O16/O17 prediction is
+-10 to 40 per cent depending on the stellar mass, and is persistently
dominated by the comparatively small uncertainty of the O16(p,gamma)F17
reaction. With the new estimates on reaction rate uncertainties by the NACRE
compilation, the p-capture reactions O17(p,alpha)N14 and O17(p,gamma)F18 have
virtually no impact on theoretical predictions for stellar mass <= 1.5 M_sun.
However, this is not the case for masses > 1.5 M_sun, where core mixing and
subsequent envelope mixing interact. In these cases where core mixing
complicates post-dredge-up surface abundances, uncertainty in other reactions
have a secondary but noticeable effect on surface abundances.

are different from those for the inverse square force, and these errors
dominate the total error in force. We calculate the distribution function for

of transient amplifications, taking place sequentially along the flow, may
result in a cascade amplification of these waves. However, when a flow is
swirling or helical (i.e., some rotation is imposed on the plasma motion),
Alfven waves become subject to new, much more powerful shear instabilities. In
this case, depending on the type of differential rotation, both usual and
parametric instabilities may appear. We claim that these phenomena may lead to
the generation of large amplitude Alfven waves and the mechanism may account
for the appearance of such waves in the solar atmosphere, in accretion-ejecion
flows and in accretion columns. These processes may also serve as an important
initial (linear and nonmodal) phase in the ultimate subcritical transition to
MHD Alfvenic turbulence in various kinds of astrophysical shear flows.

approximately as expected as the effective temperature of the central exciting
star(s) increases. However, the 2.058um 2^1P-2^1S HeI line does not behave as
the model predicts, or as seen in planetary nebulae. Both models and planetary
nebulae showed a decrease in the HeI 2^1P-2^1S/HI Br gamma ratio above an
effective temperature of 40000K. The compact HII regions do not show any such
decrease. The problem with this line ratio is probably due to the fact that the
photoionisation model does not account correctly for the high densities seen in
these HII regions, and that we are therefore seeing more collisional excitation
of the 2^1P level than the model predicts. It may also reflect some deeper
problem in the assumed model stellar atmospheres. In any event, although the
normal HeI recombination lines can be used to place constraints on the
temperature of the hottest star present, the HeI 2^1P-2^1S/HI Br gamma ratio
should not be used for this purpose in either Galactic HII regions or in
starburst galaxies, and conclusions from previous work using this ratio should
be regarded with extreme caution. We also show that the combination of the near
infrared `pure' recombination line ratios with mid-infrared forbidden line data
provides a good discriminant of the form of the far ultraviolet spectral energy
distribution of the exciting star(s). From this we conclude that CoStar models
are a poor match to the available data for our sources, though the more recent

thermodynamics and folding/unfolding kinetics of small single-domain proteins?
To address this question, we investigate the folding and unfolding of a
hierarchy of continuum Langevin dynamics models of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2. We
find that residue-based additive G\=o-like contact energies, although
native-centric, are by themselves insufficient for proteinlike calorimetric
two-state cooperativity. Further native biases by local conformational
preferences are necessary for proteinlike thermodynamics. Kinetically, however,
even models with both contact and local native-centric energies do not produce
simple two-state chevron plots. Thus a model protein's thermodynamic
cooperativity is not sufficient for simple two-state kinetics. The models
tested appear to have increasing internal friction with increasing native
stability, leading to chevron rollovers that typify kinetics that are commonly
referred to as non-two-state. The free energy profiles of these models are
found to be sensitive to the choice of native contacts and the presumed spatial
ranges of the contact interactions. Motivated by explicit-water considerations,
we explore recent treatments of solvent granularity that incorporate
desolvation free energy barriers into effective implicit-solvent intraprotein
interactions. This additional feature reduces both folding and unfolding rates
vis-\`a-vis that of the corresponding models without desolvation barriers, but
the kinetics remain non-two-state. Taken together, our observations suggest
that interaction mechanisms

coexistence of structurally and electronically different phases. We present
extensive experimental data for a prototypical system exhibiting such a phase
coexistence, (La,Pr)$_{5/8}$Ca$_{3/8}$MnO$_{3}$. These data reveal that
percolative transport phenomena play the key role in the metal-insulator
transition in this system, and are largely responsible for the significant
magnitude of the magnetoresistance. The phase composition of the multiphase
states is governed by both the electron correlations and the effects of
martensitic accommodation strain. The second type of an inhomogeneous state is
realized in the paramagnetic state commonly found in manganites at
high-temperatures. In this state, nanometer-scale structural correlations
associated with nanoscale charge/orbital ordered regions are observed.
Experimental investigation of numerous manganite systems indicates that these
correlations are generic in orthorhombic mixed-valent manganites, and that the
correlated regions play an essential role in the CMR effect.

  Representation independence or relational parametricity formally
characterizes the encapsulation provided by language constructs for data
abstraction and justifies reasoning by simulation. Representation independence
has been shown for a variety of languages and constructs but not for shared
references to mutable state; indeed it fails in general for such languages.
This paper formulates representation independence for classes, in an
imperative, object-oriented language with pointers, subclassing and dynamic
dispatch, class oriented visibility control, recursive types and methods, and a
simple form of module. An instance of a class is considered to implement an
abstraction using private fields and so-called representation objects.
Encapsulation of representation objects is expressed by a restriction, called
confinement, on aliasing. Representation independence is proved for programs
satisfying the confinement condition. A static analysis is given for
confinement that accepts common designs such as the observer and factory
patterns. The formalization takes into account not only the usual interface
between a client and a class that provides an abstraction but also the
interface (often called ``protected'') between the class and its subclasses.

this way, we are able to confirm a uniformly spaced spectrum even for a fully

SM fermion spectrum appears at the intersections of D-branes wrapping a compact
space. In simple toroidal realistic examples one can explicitly compute the
Yukawa couplings as a function of the geometrical data summing over world-sheet
instanton contributions. A particular simple model with a N = 1 SUSY spectrum
and three quark-lepton generations is studied in some detail. Remarkably, one
can reproduce the observed spectrum of quark masses and mixings for particular
choices of the compact radii and brane locations. In order to reproduce the
smallness of up- and down-quark masses branes should be located in simple
geometric configurations leading to some accidental global symmetries. We also
find that the brane configurations able to reproduce the observed data may be
considered as a deformation (by brane translation) of a configuration with
Pati-Salam gauge symmetry. The origin of CP-violation in this formalism is
quite elegant. It appears as a consequence of the generic presence of U(1)
Wilson line backgrounds in the compact dimensions. One can reproduce the
observed results for the CP-violation Jarlskog invariant J as long as the
compact radii are of order of the string scale.

note that the electric charges of the observed fermions imply that any such Z'

the usual hypercharge along with another U(1) component in a kinetic-diagonal
basis. Assuming that the observed quarks and leptons have
generation-independent U(1) charges, and that no new fermions couple to the
standard model gauge bosons, we find that their U(1) charges form a
two-parameter family consistent with anomaly cancellation and viable fermion
masses, provided there are at least three right-handed neutrinos. We then
derive bounds on the Z' mass and couplings imposed by direct production and
Z-pole measurements. For generic charge assignments and a gauge coupling of
electromagnetic strength, the strongest lower bound on the Z' mass comes from
Z-pole measurements, and is of order 1 TeV. If the new U(1) charges are
proportional to B-L, however, there is no tree-level mixing between the Z and
Z', and the best bounds come from the absence of direct production at LEPII and
the Tevatron. If the U(1) gauge coupling is one or two orders of magnitude
below the electromagnetic one, these bounds are satisfied for most values of
the Z' mass.

two-particle angular correlation measurements verify the presence of a partonic
hard scattering and fragmentation component at high $p_T$ in both central and
peripheral Au+Au collisions. When triggering on a leading hadron with $p_T>$4
GeV, we observe a quantitative agreement between the jet cone properties in p+p
and all centralities of Au+Au collisions. This quantitative agreement indicates
that nearly all hadrons with $p_T>$4 GeV/c come from jet fragmentation and that
jet fragmentation properties are not substantially modified in Au+Au
collisions. STAR has also measured the strength of back-to-back high $p_T$
charged hadron correlations, and observes a small suppression of the
back-to-back correlation strength in peripheral collisions, and a nearly
complete disappearance of back-to-back correlations in central Au+Au events.
These phenomena, toghether with the observed strong suppression of inclusive
yields and large value of elliptic flow at high $p_T$, are consistent with a
model where high $p_T$ hadrons come from partons created near the surface of
the collision region, and where partons that originate or propagate towards the
center of the collision region are substantially slowed or completely absorbed.

  Accepted for pubblication on Phys. Rev. C","Phys.Rev. C68 (2003) 014311","10.1103/PhysRevC.68.014311",,"nucl-th",,"  A microscopic formalism is developed that includes the coupling to two

random phase approximation (DRPA) equation for a finite system.
  The resulting formalism is applied to study the low-lying excitation spectrum
of 16O.
  It is observed that the coupling to two-phonon states at low energy generates
excited states with quantum numbers that cannot be obtained in the DRPA
approach.
  Nevertheless, the two-phonon states mix weakly with particle-hole
configurations and participate only partially in the formation of the
lowest-lying positive-parity excited states.
  The stability of the present calculation is tested vs. the truncation of
model space. It is demonstrated that when single-particle strength
fragmentation is properly considered, the present formalism exhibits
convergence with respect to the chosen model space within the confines of the
chosen approximation scheme.

variables describing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows of general type without
any restrictions for invariants of the motion. It is shown that the velocity
representation of the Clebsch type introduced by means of the variational
principle with constraints is equivalent to the representation following from
the generalization of the Weber transformation for the case of arbitrary MHD
flows. The integrals of motion and local invariants for MHD are under
examination. It is proved that there exists generalization of the Ertel
invariant. It is expressed in terms of generalized vorticity field (discussed
earlier by Vladimirov and Moffatt (V. A. Vladimirov, H. K. Moffatt, J. Fl.
Mech., vol. 283, pp.~125--139, 1995) for the incompressible case). The
generalized vorticity presents the frozen-in field for the barotropic and
isentropic flows and therefore for these flows there exists generalized
helicity invariant. This result generalizes one obtained by Vladimirov and
Moffatt in the cited work for the incompressible fluid. It is shown that to
each invariant of the conventional hydrodynamics corresponds MHD invariant and
therefore our approach allows correct limit transition to the conventional
hydrodynamic case. The additional advantage of the approach proposed enables
one to deal with discontinuous flows, including all types of possible breaks.

quantum logical operations by the quantum nature of the laser field. While this
error will typically (for a paraxial beam) be smaller than the total error due
to spontaneous emission, a unified treatment of both effects reveals that they
lead to formally similar constraints on the minimum number of photons per pulse
required to perform an operation with a given accuracy; these constraints agree
with those I have derived elsewhere.
