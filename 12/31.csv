which arises from cosmic-rays interacting with the gas. If this dark matter

at low to mid Galactic latitudes where they lie within the cosmic-ray disk. The
predicted emission for such clusters is steady, continuum emission with peak
power emerging at several hundred MeV. These sources would not have obvious
counterparts at other wavelengths and are thus of interest in connection with
the UnIDentified (UID) EGRET sources. Here we present a Monte Carlo simulation
of the gamma-ray source population due to cold gas clouds, assuming a
Cold-Dark-Matter-like mass spectrum for the clustering. We find that ~280 EGRET
sources are predicted by this model, with a median Galactic latitude of 12
degrees for the population, and a median angular size of 2.2 degrees. The
latitude and size distributions are consistent with the UID EGRET source data,
but the source counts are clearly overpredicted. On the basis of these results
we propose that clusters of cold gas clouds comprise the majority population of
the observed UID EGRET sources. Our interpretation implies that there should be
microwave counterparts to most of the UID sources, and will thus be strongly
constrained by data from the present generation of microwave anisotropy
experiments.

a dark energy component with negative pressure. The most obvious candidate for
this dark energy is the cosmological constant (with the equation of state
w_X=p/\rho=-1), which, however, raises several theoretical difficulties. This
has led to models for dark energy component which evolves with time. We discuss
certain questions related to the determination of the nature of dark energy
component from observations of high redshift supernova. The main results of our
analysis are: (i) Even if the precise value of w_X is known from observations,
it is not possible to determine the nature of the unknown dark energy source
using only kinematical and geometrical measurements. We have given explicit
examples to show that different types of sources can give rise to a given w_X.
(ii) Although the full data set of supernova observations (which are currently
available) strongly rule out models without dark energy, the high (z>0.25) and
low (z<0.25) redshift data sets, individually, admit decelerating models with
zero dark energy. Any possible evolution in the absolute magnitude of the
supernovae, if detected, might allow the decelerating models to be consistent
with the data. (iii) We have introduced two parameters, which can be obtained
entirely from theory, to study the sensitivity of the luminosity distance on
w_X. Using these two parameters, we have argued that although one can determine
the present value of w_X accurately from the data, one cannot constrain the
evolution of w_X.

halos. We find analytical, fully cosmological similarity solutions taking
account of the collisional interaction of SIDM particles. This interaction
results in a thermal conductivity that heats the halo core and flattens its
density profile. These similarity solutions are relevant to galactic and
cluster halo formation in the CDM model. We assume an initial mass profile dM/M
M^{-eps}, as in the familiar secondary infall model. If eps=1/6, SIDM halos
will evolve self-similarly, with a cold, supersonic infall terminated by a
strong accretion shock. Different solutions arise for different values of the
collisionality parameter, Q= sigma rho_b r_s, where sigma is the scattering
cross section, rho_b is the cosmic mean density, and r_s is the shock radius.
For all these solutions, a flat-density, isothermal core is present which grows
in size as a fixed fraction of r_s. We find two different regimes for these
solutions: 1) for Q \leq Q_{th}, the core density decreases and core size
increases as Q increases; 2) for Q \geq Q_{th}, the core density increases and
core size decreases as Q increases. Our similarity solutions are in agreement
with previous N-body simulations of SIDM halos, which correspond to the low-Q
regime, if Q=[8.4e-4 - 4.9e-2]Q_{th} (low-Q), or sigma=[0.56-5.6]cm^2/g. As
Q=\infty, our similarity solution aquires a central density cusp, in agreement
with some simulation results which used an ordinary collisional fluid to
approximate the effects of SIDM collisionality. When Q=[18.6-231]Q_{th} or
sigma=[1.2e4 - 2.71e4]cm^2/g, for which we find flat-density cores comparable
to those of the observationally acceptable low-Q solutions, has not previously

reduce the CPU time processor for spherical harmonic transformation, in order
to perform the PS detection in a reasonable time. The presented algorithm is

several PS at different channels, allowing the study of the spectral behaviour

statement has been questioned by a number of authors, with important
implications on molecular clouds' lifetimes, we will review this subject within

numerical evidence that MCs are not in VE, that there is a strong exchange of
mass, momentum and energy between clouds and their surrounding medium, and that
it is difficult (if not impossible) to form quasistatic cores inside MCs,
suggesting that they must be transient, short-lived phenomena. Thus, their

central black hole is represented by a Newtonian point mass. We consider three
triaxial shapes: almost prolate, almost oblate and maximally triaxial. Two
kinds of orbital solution are attempted for each mass model: the first
including only regular orbits, the second including chaotic orbits as well. We
find that stable configurations exist in the maximally triaxial and
nearly-oblate cases; however steady-state solutions in the nearly-prolate

the magnetic field penetration depth in high-Tc cuprate superconductors with
simple hole doping, Zn-doping, overdoping, and formation of static SDW nano
islands. System dependence of $n_{s}/m^{*}$ (superconducting carrier density /
effective mass) reveals universal correlations between Tc and $n_{s}/m^{*}$ in
all these cases with / without perturbation. Evidence for spontaneous and
microscopic phase separation was obtained in the cases with strong
perturbation, i.e., Zn-doping. overdoping and SDW nano-islands. The length
scale of this heterogeneity is shown to be comparable to the in-plance
coherence length. We discuss implications of these results on condensation
mechanisms of HTSC systems, resorting to an analogy with He films, on regular
and porous media, reminding essential features of Bose-Einstein, BCS and
Kosterlitz-Thouless condensation/transition in 2-d and 3-d systems, and
comparing models of BE-BCS crossover and phase fluctuations. We propose a new
phase diagram for HTSC systems based on distinction between pair formation and
superconducting phase fluctuations in the pseudogap region and spontaneous
phase separation in the overdoped region. We also remind anomaly in BEDT and
A3C60 systems similar to that in overdoped cuprates, seen in the evolution from
superconducting to metallic ground state.

  growth","22 pages, 23 figures (minor changes in text and one figure, submitted
  to Phys. Rev. E.)",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft",,"  We study a class of one-dimensional, nonequilibrium, conserved growth
equations for both nonconserved and conserved noise statistics using numerical
integration. An atomistic version of these growth equations is also studied
using stochastic simulation. The models with nonconserved noise statistics are
found to exhibit mound formation and power-law coarsening with slope selection
for a range of values of the model parameters. Unlike previously proposed
models of mound formation, the Ehrlich-Schwoebel step-edge barrier, usually
modeled as a linear instability in growth equations, is absent in our models.
Mound formation in our models occurs due to a nonlinear instability in which
the height (depth) of spontaneously generated pillars (grooves) increases
rapidly if the initial height (depth) is sufficiently large. When this
instability is controlled by the introduction of an infinite number of
higher-order gradient nonlinearities, the system exhibits a first-order
dynamical phase transition from a rough self-affine phase to a mounded one as
the value of the parameter that measures the effectiveness of control is
decreased. We define a new ``order parameter'' that may be used to distinguish
between these two phases. In the mounded phase, the system exhibits power-law
coarsening of the mounds in which a selected slope is retained at all times.
The coarsening exponents for the continuum equation and the discrete model are
found to be different. An explanation of this difference is proposed and
verified by simulations. In the growth equation with conserved noise, we find
the curious result that the kinetically rough and mounded phases are both
locally stable in a region of parameter space. In this region, the initial
configuration of the system determines its steady-state behavior.

different active Schwarzschild masses on each side. We then examine the
dynamics of shells with non-vanishing tangential pressure $p$, and show that
there are no stable--stationary, or otherwise--solutions for configurations

$\sigma$ is the proper surface energy density and $\alpha\in(-1,1)$. For {\em

that a thin boundary layer causes the apparent horizon to evolve
discontinuously. Finally, we derive an analytical (necessary and sufficient)
condition for neighboring shells to cross, and compare the discrete shell model

physicists. These databases must be maintained and checked repeatedly to insure
the accuracy of their content. The COMPETE collaboration aims at motivating
data maintenance via the interfacing of theory and experiment at the database
level. The database concept then needs to be supplemented by a ""model-base"".
Such an object enables one not only to decide what the best description may be,
but also to discern what potential problems exist in the data. The
systematization of such a cross-fertilization between models and data results
in the ""object of knowledge"" that is the point at which all existing
information resources on a given problem could converge. There are many
advantages to such a global approach. First of all, the maintenance of a data
set is not a static task: it needs to be motivated by physics. The second
advantage is that one can have a common testing ground for theories and models.
Thirdly, an extensive theoretical database can be used to plan new experiments
and to predict various quantities. Finally, as new data come in, one can very
quickly decide on their theoretical impact, and hence immediately evaluate the
need for new physics ideas.
  As we want to treat a large amount of data and many models, computer
technology constitutes an important part of our activity. We have concentrated
on the elaboration of artificial intelligence decision-making algorithms, as
well as on the delivery of computer tools for the end-user. Further linkage
with existing databases, such as PDG, COMPAS, and HEPDATA is being developed or
planned.

We
calculate the energy flux of the slowly rolling background scalar field through
the quasi-de Sitter apparent horizon and set it equal to the change of the
entropy (1/4 of the area) multiplied by the temperature, dE=TdS. Remarkably,
this thermodynamic law reproduces the Friedmann equation for the rolling scalar
field. The flux of the slowly rolling field through the horizon of the quasi-de
Sitter geometry is similar to the accretion of a rolling scalar field onto a
black hole, which we also analyze. Next we add inflaton fluctuations which
generate scalar metric perturbations. Metric perturbations result in a
variation of the area entropy. Again, the equation dE=TdS with fluctuations
reproduces the linearized Einstein equations. In this picture as long as the
Einstein equations hold, holography does not put limits on the quantum field
theory during inflation. Due to the accumulating metric perturbations, the
horizon area during inflation randomly wiggles with dispersion increasing with
time. We discuss this in connection with the stochastic decsription of
inflation. We also address the issue of the instability of inflaton
fluctuations in the ``hot tin can'' picture of de Sitter horizon.

the complex numbers or for split real forms is extended to other real forms, in
particular to those compatible with supersymmetry. Specifically, all theories
of the Magic triangle that reduce to the pure supergravities in four dimensions
correspond to singular real del Pezzo surfaces and the same is true for the
Magic square of N=2 SUGRAS. A real del Pezzo surface is the invariant set under
an antilinear involution of a complex one. This conjugation induces an
involution of the Picard group that preserves the anticanonical class and the
intersection form. The known non-split U-duality algebras are embedded into
superBorcherds algebras defined by their Cartan matrix (minus the intersection
form) and fixed by the anti-involution. These data may be described by
Tits-Satake bicoloured diagrams. As in the split case, oxidation results from
blowing down disjoint real P^1's of self-intersection -1. The singular del
Pezzo surfaces of interest are obtained by degenerating regular surfaces upon
contraction of real curves of self-intersection -2. We use the finite
classification of real simple singularities to exhibit the relevant normal
surfaces. We also give a general construction of more magic triangles like a
type I split magic triangle and prove their (approximate) symmetry with respect
to their diagonal, this symmetry argument was announced in our previous paper
for the split case.

their discovery. Now that quantum-gravitational theories have started to become
available, the inclusion of a description of spin in the development is natural
and may bring about a profound understanding of the mathematical structure of
fundamental physics. A program to attempt this is laid out here. Concepts from
a known quantum-geometrical theory are reviewed: (1) Classical physics is
replaced by a suitable geometry as a fundamental starting point for quantum
mechanics. (2) In this context, a resolution is found for the enigma of
wave-particle duality. (3) It is shown how to couple the quantum density to the
geometrical density. (4) The mechanical gauge is introduced to allow
dimensional reduction. (5) Absolute geometrical equivalence is enforced. The
concordant five-dimensional quantum-geometrical theory is summarized to provide
an orderly basis for the introduction of spinors. It is supposed that the
Pauli--Dirac theory is adaptable. A search is begun for a description that will
generate spinors as a natural tangent space. Interactions other than gravity
and electrodynamics should then appear intrinsically. These are conjectured to
be weak effects for electrons.

responses to natural stimuli which are non-Gaussian and exhibit strong

small number of stimulus dimensions out of a high dimensional stimulus space,
but within this subspace the responses can be arbitrarily nonlinear. Existing
analysis methods are based on correlation functions between stimuli and
responses, but these methods are guaranteed to work only in the case of
Gaussian stimulus ensembles. As an alternative to correlation functions, we
maximize the mutual information between the neural responses and projections of
the stimulus onto low dimensional subspaces. The procedure can be done
iteratively by increasing the dimensionality of this subspace. Those dimensions
that allow the recovery of all of the information between spikes and the full
unprojected stimuli describe the relevant subspace. If the dimensionality of
the relevant subspace indeed is small, it becomes feasible to map the neuron's
input-output function even under fully natural stimulus conditions. These ideas
are illustrated in simulations on model visual and auditory neurons responding
to natural scenes and sounds, respectively.

dissipative optical lattice. We show that two different pump-probe
configurations may lead to the excitation, via different mechanisms, of the
same mode. We found that in one configuration the scattering on the propagation
mode results in a resonance in the probe transmission spectrum while in the
other configuration no modification of the scattering spectrum occurs, i.e. the
mode is dark. A theoretical explanation of this behaviour is provided.

optimal quadrature noise level is presented. The validity of the new scaling
law is checked numerically and analytically.

localization properties of local spectral density for a generic system of
coupled quantum states with strong static imperfection in the unperturbed
energy levels. The system is excited by an external periodic field, the
temporal profile of which is close to monochromatic one. The shape of local
spectral density is shown to be well described by the contour obtained from a
relevant model of periodically driven two-states system with irreversible
losses to an external thermal bath. The shape width and the inverse
participation ratio are determined as functions both of the Rabi frequency and
of parameters specifying the localization effect for our system in the absence
of external field.

is estimated when the channel has losses and noises. We assume that Alice and
Bob use two nonorthogonal single-photon polarization states. To make our
analysis simple, we propose a modified B92 protocol in which Alice and Bob make
use of inconclusive results and Bob performs a kind of symmetrization of
received states. Using this protocol, Alice and Bob can estimate Eve's
information gain as a function of a few parameters which reflect the
imperfections of devices or Eve's disturbance. In some parameter regions, Eve's
maximum information gain shows counter-intuitive behavior, namely, it decreases
as the amount of disturbances increases. For a small noise rate Eve can extract
perfect information in the case where the angle between Alice's two states is
small or large, while she cannot extract perfect information for intermediate
angles. We also estimate the secret key gain which is the net growth of the
secret key per one pulse. We show the region where the modified B92 protocol
over a realistic channel is secure against individual attack.

evolution of a partially dressed two-level atom. The partially dressed atom is
obtained by a rapid change of an atomic parameter such as its transition
frequency, due to the action of some external agent. The electromagnetic field
fluctuations around the atom, averaged over the solid angle for simplicity, are
calculated as a function of time, and it is shown that the interaction energy
with a second atom yields a dynamical Casimir-Polder potential between the two
atoms.

processed using quantum resources such as entangled states, local operations
and classical communications. Two important protocols in quantum communications
are quantum teleportation and remote state preparation. In quantum
teleportation neither the sender nor the receiver know the identity of a state.
In remote state preparation the sender knows the state which is to be remotely
prepared without ever physically sending the object or the complete classical
description of it. Using one unit of entanglement and one classical bit Alice
can remotely prepare a photon (from special ensemble) of her choice at Bob's
laboratory. In remote state measurement Alice asks Bob to simulate any single
particle measurement statistics on an arbitrary photon. In this talk we will
present these ideas and discuss the latest developments and future open
problems.
