directly probes the mass distribution in the universe. This distribution, and
its evolution at late times, is sensitive to both the dark energy, a negative
pressure energy density component, and neutrino mass. We examine the potential
of lensing experiments to measure features of both simultaneously. Focusing on
the radial information contained in a future deep 4000 square degree survey, we
find that the expected (1-sigma) error on a neutrino mass is 0.1 eV, if the
dark energy parameters are allowed to vary. The constraints on dark energy
parameters are similarly restrictive, with errors on w of 0.09. Much of the
restrictive power on the dark energy comes not from the evolution of the
gravitational potential but rather from how distances vary as a function of
redshift in different cosmologies.

Associations were obtained. These measurements confirm our earlier findings of
an interstellar ^7Li/^6Li ratio of about 2 toward o Per, the value predicted
from models of Galactic cosmic ray spallation reactions. Observations of other
nearby stars yield limits consistent with the isotopic ratio ~ 12 seen in
carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. If this ratio originally represented the gas
toward o Per, then to decrease the original isotope ratio to its current value
an order of magnitude increase in the Li abundance is expected, but is not
seen. The elemental K/Li ratio is not unusual, although Li and K are formed via
different nucleosynthetic pathways. Several proposals to account for the low
^7Li/^6Li ratio were considered, but none seems satisfactory.
  Analysis of the Li and K abundances from our survey highlighted two sight
lines where depletion effects are prevalent. There is evidence for enhanced
depletion toward X Per, since both abundances are lower by a factor of 4 when
compared to other sight lines. Moreover, a smaller Li/H abundance is observed
toward 20 Aql, but the K/H abundance is normal, suggesting enhanced Li
depletion (relative to K) in this direction. Our results suggest that the
^7Li/^6Li ratio has not changed significantly during the last 4.5 billion years
and that a ratio ~ 12 represents most gas in the solar neighborhood. In
addition, there appears to be a constant stellar contribution of ^7Li,
indicating that one or two processes dominate its production in the Galaxy.

face-on, moderately late-type spiral galaxy. Multi-wavelength morphological
studies of the HDF-N have heretofore revealed no galaxies with any kind of

bright envelope of rest-frame B-band galaxy luminosities is similar from 0<z<3,
and the co-moving luminosity density is constant to within a factor of 3 over
that redshift range. However, galaxies at higher redshifts are bluer, and
stellar population modeling indicates that they had significantly lower
mass-to-light ratios than those of present-day L* galaxies. This leads to a
global stellar mass density, Omega_*(z), which rises with time from z=3 to the
present. This measurement essentially traces the integral of the cosmic star
formation history that has been the subject of previous investigations. 50-75%
of the present-day stellar mass density had formed by z ~ 1, but at z ~= 2.7 we
find only 3-14% of today's stars were present. This increase in Omega_* with

formation rate once dust extinction is taken into account, but is steeper at
1<z<3 than predicted by some recent semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.

across the nebula. We also measure the intrinsic line ratio [N II] 5756/6585 in
order to estimate T_e and t_A^2 in the N^+ region. The interpretation of the [N
II] data is not as clear cut as the [O III] data because of a higher
sensitivity to knowledge of the electron density as well as a possible
contribution to the [N II] 5756 emission by recombination (and cascading). We
present results from binning the data along the various slits into tiles that
are 0.5"" square (matching the slit width). The average [O III] temperature for
our four HST/STIS slits varies from 7678 K to 8358 K; t_A^2 varies from 0.00682

for each of the four slits varies from 9133 K to 10232 K; t_A^2 varies from
0.00584 to 0.0175. The measurements of T_e reported here are an average along
each line of sight. Therefore, despite finding remarkably low t_A^2, we cannot
rule out significantly larger temperature fluctuations along the line of sight.
The result that the average [N II] T_e exceeds the average [O III] T_e confirms
what has been previously found for Orion and what is expected on theoretical
grounds. Observations of the proplyd P159-350 indicate: large local extinction
associated; ionization stratification consistent with external ionization by
theta^1 Ori C; and indirectly, evidence of high electron density.

idealized abstractions as there is always another body to distort the
potential. This is considered with respect to both gravitational tunneling, and
black hole ""no-hair"" theorems. The effects of a second body are to lower the
gravitational barrier of a black hole and to give the barrier a finite rather
than infinite width so tha a particle can escape by tunneling (as in field
emission) or over the top of the lowered barrier (as in Schottky emission).
Thus radiation may be emitted from black holes in a process differing from that
of Hawking radiation, P SH, which has been undetected for over 24 years. The
radiated power from a black hole derived here is PR e ^2__ PSH, where e ^2__ is
he ransmission probability for radiation through the barrier. This is similar
to electric field emission of electrons from a metal in that the emission can
in principle be modulated and beamed. The temperature and entropy of black
holes are reexamined. Miniscule black holes herein may help explain the missing
mass of the universe, accelerated expansion of the universe, and anomalous
rotation of spiral galaxies. A gravitational interference effect for black hole
radiation similar to the Aharonov-Bohm effect is also examined.

  This instrument, a combination of a fixed-delay interferometer with a

spectrometers. Doppler RV is measured through monitoring interference fringe
shifts of stellar absorption lines over a broad band. Coupling this
multi-object instrument with a wide field telescope (a few degree, such as
Sloan and WIYN) and UV, visible and near-IR detectors will allow to
simultaneously obtain hundreds of stellar fringing spectra for searching for
planets. The RV survey speed can be increased by more than 2 orders of
magnitude over that for the echelles.
  A prototype dispersed fixed-delay interferometer has been observed at the
Hobby-Eberly 9m and Palomar 5m telescopes in 2001 and demonstrated photo noise
limited Doppler precision with Aldebaran. Our recent observations at the KPNO
2.1m telescope in 2002 demonstrate a short term Doppler precision of ~ 3 m/s

that the cluster's halo extends at least out to ~30' from the cluster center in
agreement with previous study, but the profile of faint stars at the very outer

system the melting transition line is shifted to slightly lower fields. The
correlations of the order parameter for translational long range order of the
vortex positions seem to decay slightly faster than a power law (in agreement
with the theory of Carpentier and Le Doussal) although a simple power law decay
cannot be excluded. The corresponding positional glass correlation function
decays as a power law establishing the existence of a quasi-long range ordered
positional glass formed by the vortices. The correlation function
characterizing a phase coherent vortex glass decays however exponentially
ruling out the possible existence of a phase coherent vortex glass phase.

moving in a single Landau level: we formulate it for a general disordered

Liouvillian perturbation theory and conventional calculations of
disorder-averaged products of Green functions and show that each term in
Liouvillian perturbation theory corresponds to a specific contribution to the
two-particle Green function. As a consequence, any Liouvillian approximation
scheme may be re-expressed in the language of Green functions. We illustrate
these ideas by applying Liouvillian methods, including their extension to $N_L
> 1$ Liouvillian flavors, to random matrix ensembles, using numerical
calculations for small integer $N_L$ and an analytic analysis for large $N_L$.
We find that behavior at $N_L > 1$ is different in qualitative ways from that
at $N_L=1$. In particular, the $N_L = \infty$ limit expressed using Green
functions generates a pathological approximation, in which two-particle
correlation functions fail to factorize correctly at large separations of their
energy, and exhibit spurious singularities inside the band of random matrix
energy levels. We also consider the large $N_L$ treatment of the quantum Hall

The characteristics of electron spin dephasing is analyzed by taking an average
over the nuclear spin distribution. We find that the dephasing rate can be
estimated as a spin precession frequency caused primarily by the mean value of
the local nuclear magnetic field. Furthermore, it is shown that the hyperfine

polarization during the dephasing process depends strongly on the external

constructed and discussed as a function of the rotation speed $\omega$ of the
flow and as a function of the height of water $h$ above the surface. The study
of $r_c$ as a function of $h$, $\omega$ and $r$ parameters is reported.
Thereafter, $r_c$ is shown to depend on the rotation speed according to a power

hypothesis as output. A set of data is typically consistent with an infinite
number of hypotheses; therefore, there must be factors other than the data that
determine the output of the learning algorithm. In machine learning, these
other factors are called the bias of the learner. Classical learning algorithms
have a fixed bias, implicit in their design. Recently developed learning
algorithms dynamically adjust their bias as they search for a hypothesis.
Algorithms that shift bias in this manner are not as well understood as
classical algorithms. In this paper, we show that the Baldwin effect has
implications for the design and analysis of bias shifting algorithms. The
Baldwin effect was proposed in 1896, to explain how phenomena that might appear
to require Lamarckian evolution (inheritance of acquired characteristics) can
arise from purely Darwinian evolution. Hinton and Nowlan presented a
computational model of the Baldwin effect in 1987. We explore a variation on
their model, which we constructed explicitly to illustrate the lessons that the
Baldwin effect has for research in bias shifting algorithms. The main lesson is
that it appears that a good strategy for shift of bias in a learning algorithm
is to begin with a weak bias and gradually shift to a strong bias.

priori argument based on Gold's theorem, that purports to prove that natural
languages cannot be learned, and some formal issues related to the choice of
statistical grammars rather than symbolic grammars. I present three novel
algorithms for learning various parts of natural languages: first, an algorithm
for the induction of syntactic categories from unlabelled text using
distributional information, that can deal with ambiguous and rare words;
secondly, a set of algorithms for learning morphological processes in a variety
of languages, including languages such as Arabic with non-concatenative
morphology; thirdly an algorithm for the unsupervised induction of a
context-free grammar from tagged text. I carefully examine the interaction
between the various components, and show how these algorithms can form the
basis for a empiricist model of language acquisition. I therefore conclude that
the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus is unsupported by the evidence.

environments. The aim of the decision-making agent is to maximize the benefit
of acting in its environment over an extended period of time. Finding an
optimal policy in RL may be very slow. To speed up learning, one often used
solution is the integration of planning, for example, Sutton's Dyna algorithm,
or various other methods using macro-actions.
  Here we suggest to separate plannable, i.e., close to deterministic parts of
the world, and focus planning efforts in this domain. A novel reinforcement
learning method called plannable RL (pRL) is proposed here. pRL builds a simple
model, which is used to search for macro actions. The simplicity of the model
makes planning computationally inexpensive. It is shown that pRL finds an
optimal policy, and that plannable macro actions found by pRL are near-optimal.
In turn, it is unnecessary to try large numbers of macro actions, which enables
fast learning. The utility of pRL is demonstrated by computer simulations.

of scale transformations is replaced by the groupoid of changes of cellular
decompositions. We introduce cellular moves which generate this groupoid and
allow to define a renormalization groupoid flow.
  We proceed to test our approach on several models. Quantum BF theory is the
simplest example as it is almost topological and the renormalization almost
trivial. More interesting is generalized lattice gauge theory for which a
qualitative picture of the renormalization groupoid flow can be given. This is
confirmed by the exact renormalization in dimension two.
  A main motivation for our approach are discrete models of quantum gravity. We
investigate both the Reisenberger and the Barrett-Crane spin foam model in view
of their amenability to a renormalization treatment. In the second case a lack
of tunable local parameters prompts us to introduce a new model. For the
Reisenberger and the new model we discuss qualitative aspects of the
renormalization groupoid flow. In both cases quantum BF theory is the UV fixed

dimensions but is broken locally by a symmetry breaking defect. Gauge coupling
unification, the quantum numbers of quarks and leptons and the longevity of the
proton arise as phenomena of the symmetrical bulk, while the lightness of the
Higgs doublets and the masses of the light quarks and leptons probe the
symmetry breaking defect. Moreover, the framework is extremely predictive if
the effective higher dimensional theory is valid over a large energy interval
up to the scale of strong coupling. Precise agreement with experiments is
obtained in the simplest theory --- SU(5) in five dimensions with two Higgs
multiplets propagating in the bulk. The weak mixing angle is predicted to be
sin^2theta_w = 0.2313 \pm 0.0004, which fits the data with extraordinary
accuracy. The compactification scale and the strong coupling scale are
determined to be M_c \simeq 5 x 10^{14} GeV and M_s \simeq 1 x 10^{17} GeV,
respectively. Proton decay with a lifetime of order 10^{34} years is expected
with a variety of final states such as e^+pi^0, and several aspects of flavor,
including large neutrino mixing angles, are understood by the geometrical
locations of the matter fields. When combined with a particular supersymmetry
breaking mechanism, the theory predicts large lepton flavor violating mu -> e
and tau -> mu transitions, with all superpartner masses determined by only two
free parameters. The predicted value of the bottom quark mass from Yukawa
unification agrees well with the data. This paper is mainly a review of the

replaced by the corresponding Goldstone bosons $\omega^\pm$ is employed to test
the analytic expression and the accuracy of the numerical program. Second, the
decoupling property in the large mass limit is used to test the overall
normalization of the amplitudes. These two tests are most effectively carried
out when the amplitudes are expanded in terms of the modified minimal
subtraction ($\bar{\rm MS}$) couplings of the standard model. The resulting
perturbation expansion is valid at collider energies below and around the
threshold of the light supersymmetric particles. We find that the corrections
to the cross section of the longitudinally polarized $W$-pair production can be
as large as -1.4% at the threshold of the light chargino-pair production for
large scattering angles. We also study the effects of the CP-violating phase in

and a simple but explicit example in condensed matter is provided through the
static Clausius-Mossotti and its dynamic counterpart the Lorenz-Lorentz

to be super-radiance. We verify quantitatively that water (and many other polar
liquids) are indeed super-radiant at room temperature. In quantum
chromo-dynamics on the other hand, we encounter, thanks to asymptotic freedom,
an ``anti-ghost'' which is closely associated with color confinement. Thus, in

the normal one.

particular, if the BPS operators have dimensions equal to three or four, the
corresponding four-point amplitude is determined by one or two independent
functions of the two conformal cross-ratios, respectively. This restriction on
the amplitude does not merely follow from the superconformal Ward identities,
it also encodes dynamical information related to the structure of the gauge

first non-trivial massive Kaluza-Klein mode of the compactified type IIB

has a surprisingly simple sigma-model-type form with at most two derivatives.

3 operators. Remarkably, this amplitude splits into a ""free"" and an
""interacting"" parts in exact agreement with the structure predicted by the

not necessarily equally spaced. The asymptotic results are given with error
bound for all points in the complex plane except for a finite union of discs of
arbitrarily small but fixed radii. These exceptional discs are the
neighborhoods of the so-called band edges of the associated equilibrium

in particular we deduce asymptotic formulae with error bound for certain
statistics relevant in the random tiling of a hexagon with rhombus-shaped

find that the persistence, characterized by the correlation C(s) of temperature
variations separated by s days, decays for large s as a power law, C(s) ~
s^(-gamma). For continental stations, including stations along the coastlines,
we find that gamma is always close to 0.7. For stations on islands, we find
that gamma ranges between 0.3 and 0.7, with a maximum at gamma = 0.4. This is
consistent with earlier studies of the persistence in sea surface temperature
records where gamma is close to 0.4. In all cases, the exponent gamma does not
depend on the distance of the stations to the continental coastlines. By
varying the degree of detrending in the fluctuation analysis we obtain also
information about trends in the temperature records.

of motion. This vector has been associated with the names of Laplace, Runge,
and Lenz, among others. Many workers have explored aspects of the symmetry and
degeneracy associated with this vector and with analogous dynamical symmetris.
We define a conserved dynamical variable $\alpha$ that characterizes the
orientation of the orbit in two-dimensional configuration space for the Kepler
problem and an analogous variable $\beta$ for the isotropic harmonics
oscillator. This orbit orientation variable is canonically conjugate to the
angular momentum component normal to the plane of motion. We explore the
canoncial one-parameter group of transformations generated by $\alpha (\beta).$
Because we have an obvious pair of conserved canonically conjugate variables,
it is desirable to us them as a coordinate-momentum pair. In terms of these
phase space coordinates, the form of the Hamiltonian is nearly trivial because
neither member of the pair can occur explicitly in the Hamiltonian. From these
considerations we gain a simple picture of the dynamics in phase space. The
procedure we use is in the spirit of the Hamilton-Jacobi method.

the double strand opens is characterized by an interaction potential. The form
of the potential determines whether the opening is active or passive. We
calculate the rate of passive opening for the helicase PcrA, and show that the
rate increases when the opening is active. Finally, we examine how to choose
the interaction potential to optimize the rate of strand separation. One
important result is our finding that active opening can increase the unwinding
