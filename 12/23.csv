this end we use SPH simulations in gravitational potentials determined from the
NIR luminosity distribution (including spiral arms) which are based on the
COBE/DIRBE maps. Gas flows in models which include massive spiral arms clearly
match the observed 12CO lvplot better than if the potential does not include
spiral structure. Besides single pattern speed models we investigate models
with separate pattern speeds for the bar and spiral arms. The most important
difference is that in the latter case the gas spiral arms go through the bar
corotation region, keeping the gas aligned with the arms there. In the (l,v)
plot this results in characteristic regions which appear to be nearly void of
gas.In single pattern speed models these regions are filled with gas because
the spiral arms dissolve in the bar corotation region. Comparing with the 12CO
data we find evidence for separate pattern speeds in the Milky Way.From a
series of models the preferred range for the bar pattern speed is Om_p=60\pm5
/Gyr, corresponding to corotation at 3.4\pm0.3kpc. The spiral pattern speed is
less well constrained, but our preferred value is Om_sp\approx 20 /Gyr. A
further series of gas models is computed for different bar angles, using
separately determined luminosity models and gravitational potentials in each
case. We find acceptable gas models for 20<=\phibar<=25. The model with
(\phibar=20, Om_p=60 /Gyr, Om_sp=20 /Gyr) gives an excellent fit to the spiral
arm ridges in the observed (l,v) plot.

high-resolution images of circumstellar dust shells at various wavelengths.
This code solves the equation of radiative transfer following the principle of
long characteristic in a 2-D polar grid while considering a 3-D radiation field
at each grid point. A solution is sought through an iterative scheme in which
self-consistency of the solution is achieved by requiring a global luminosity
constancy throughout the shell. The dust opacities are calculated through Mie
theory from the given size distribution and optical properties of the dust
grains. The main focus of the code is to obtain insights on (1) the global
energetics of dust grains in the shell (2) the 2-D projected morphologies that
are strongly dependent on the mixed effects of the axisymmetric dust
distribution and inclination angle of the shell. Here, test models are
presented with discussion of the results. The code can be supplied with a
user-defined density distribution function, and thus, is applicable to a
variety of dusty astronomical objects possessing the axisymmetric geometry.

an accretion disc in Active Galactic Nuclei, in the lamppost model. We extend
their study to the flare model, which postulates the release of a large X-ray
flux above a small region of the accretion disc. A fundamental difference with
the lamppost model is that the region of the disc below the flare is not
illuminated before the onset of the flare.
  A few test models show that the spectrum which follows immediately the
increase in continuum flux should display the characteristics of a highly
illuminated but dense gas, i.e. very intense X-ray emission lines and
ionization edges in the soft X-ray range. The behaviour of the iron line is
different in the case of a ""moderate"" and a ``strong'' flare: for a moderate
flare, the spectrum displays a neutral component of the Fe K$\alpha$ line at
6.4 keV, gradually leading to more highly ionized lines. For a strong flare,
the lines are already emitted by FeXXV (around 6.7 keV) after the onset, and
have an equivalent width of several hundreds of eV. We find that the observed
correlations between $R$, $\Gamma$, and the X-ray flux, are well accounted by a
combination of flares having not achieved pressure equilibrium, strongly
suggesting that the observed spectrum is dominated by regions in non-pressure
equilibrium, typical of the onset of the flares. Finally a flare being confined
to a small region of the disc, the spectral lines should be narrow (except for
a weak Compton broadening), Doppler shifted, and moving.

that for the diffusion and a sizeable deviations appear for the smaller size

behavior at low temperatures where a highly nonlinear dependence on size is
observed. An inspection of the trajectories of the particles shows that at low

the simplest Higgs scalar triplet model in general relativity. We begin with
establishing some common features of hedgehog-type solutions with a regular
center, independent of the choice of the symmetry-breaking potential. There are
six types of qualitative behavior of the solutions; we show, in particular,
that the metric can contain at most one simple horizon. For the standard
Mexican hat potential, the previously known properties of the solutions are
confirmed and some new results are obtained. Thus, we show analytically that
solutions with monotonically growing Higgs field and finite energy in the
static region exist only in the interval $1<\gamma <3$, $\gamma $ being the
squared energy of spontaneous symmetry breaking in Planck units. The
cosmological properties of these globally regular solutions apparently favor
the idea that the standard Big Bang might be replaced with a nonsingular static
core and a horizon appearing as a result of some symmetry-breaking phase
transition on the Planck energy scale. In addition to the monotonic solutions,
we present and analyze a sequence of families of new solutions with oscillating
Higgs field. These families are parametrized by $n$, the number of knots of the
Higgs field, and exist for $\gamma < \gamma_n = 6/[(2n+1) (n+2)]$; all such
solutions possess a horizon and a singularity beyond it.

valued Weyl equation on the Euclidian space to the one on the superspace,
called the super Weyl equation. Using analysis on superspace, we may associate
a function, called the super Hamiltonian function, corresponding to that super
Weyl equation. Starting from this super Hamiltonian function, we define phase

the continuity equation on the superspace, respectively. Then, we define a

bracket on densities incorporates a bracket on functions, an ``upper
connection'' in the bundle of volume forms, and a term similar to the
``Brans--Dicke field'' of the Kaluza--Klein formalism. These results are valid
for even operators on a usual manifold as well as for odd operators on a

integral operators associated to a measure on a metric space satisfying just a
mild growth condition, namely that the measure of each ball is controlled by a
fixed power of its radius. This allows, in particular, non--doubling measures.
It turns out that this condition is enough to build up a theory that contains
the classical results based upon the Lebesgue measure on euclidean space and
their known extensions for doubling measures. We start by analyzing the images
of the Lebesgue spaces associated to the measure. The Lipschitz spaces, defined
in terms of the metric, play a basic role too. For a euclidean space equipped
with one of these measures, we also consider the so-called `` regular\rq\rq
$\bmo$ space introduced by X. Tolsa. We show that it contains the image of a
Lebesgue space in the appropriate limit case and also that the image of the
space `` regular\rq\rq $\bmo$ is contained in the adequate Lipschitz space.

logistic map models and wavelet analysis for the purpose of analyzing partial
synchronization states in high-dimensional systems. Using Embedded Complex
Logistic Maps (ECLM), time series data derived from individual system
components is directly mapped to a wavelet-like space generated from iterations
of specific complex logistic maps. These maps are selected from the complex
plane according to ""best fit"" scoring criteria with the data. The embedding
topology within and near the familiar Mandelbrot Set provides metrics which are
used to aid in clustering similarities (synchronization) between these selected
point models. The dynamics within the individual models and the correlation
between (synchronized) models is analyzed to reconstruct a unified picture of
the underlying dynamics of local system components within the global system
network topology. In this paper, ECLM is used to extract system parameters,
network graphs, and wavelet-like analytics from two real-world systems, a gene
expression network and a financial market network. Preliminary results appear
to validate the assumptions and methods used in ECLM through agreement with
current theory and recent findings. Some potentially new findings regarding
synchronization, scale-free networks, on-off intermittency, and energy
dissipation within the examples studied will also be discussed.

in quantum theory, and some quantum information applications. It starts with a
review of quantum contextuality and non-locality, multipartite entanglement
characterisation, and of a few quantum information protocols.
  Quantum non-locality and contextuality are shown to be essential for
different implementations of quantum information protocols known as quantum
random access codes and quantum communication complexity protocols. I derive
sufficient experimental conditions for tests of these quantum properties.
  I also discuss how the distribution of quantum information through quantum
cloning processes can be useful in quantum computing. Regarding entanglement
characterisation, some results are obtained relating two problems, that of
additivity of the relative entropy of entanglement, and that of identifying
different types of tripartite entanglement in the asymptotic regime of
manipulations of many copies of a given state.
  The thesis ends with a description of an information processing task in which
a single qubit substitutes for an arbitrarily large amount of classical
communication. This result is interpreted in different ways: as a gap between
quantum and classical computation space complexity; as a bound on the amount of
classical communication necessary to simulate entanglement; and as a basic
result on hidden-variable theories for quantum mechanics. I also show that the
advantage of quantum over classical communication can be established in a
feasible experiment.
