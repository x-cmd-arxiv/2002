is examined for a composite system of free electrons (Fermions with
concentration n_F) and localized electron-pairs (hard-core Bosons with
concentration n_B) as a function of doping-changing n_B. The coupling together
of these two subsystems via a charge exchange term induces electron pairing
below a certain T^* (showing up in form of a pseudogap) and ultimately
superconductivity in the Fermionic subsystem. T^* steadily decreases with
decreasing n_B. Below T^* this electron pairing leads to electron-pair resonant
states (Cooperons) with quasi-particle features which strongly depend on $n_B$.
For high concentrations, (n_B \simeq 0.5), correlation effects between the
hard-core Bosons lead to itinerant Cooperons having a heavy mass m_p, but are
long-lived. Upon reducing n_B, the mass as well as the lifetime of those
Cooperons is considerably reduced. For high values of n_B, a superconducting
state sets in at a T_c, being controlled by the phase stiffness D_\phi=\hbar^2
n_p/m_p of those Cooperons, where n_p denotes their density. Upon reducing n_B,
the phase stiffness steadily increases, and eventually exceeds the pairing
energy k_B T^*. The Cooperons loose their well defined itinerant quasi-particle
features and superconductivity gets controlled by amplitude fluctuations. The
resulting phase diagram with doping is reminiscent of that of the phase
fluctuation scenario for high T_c superconductivity, except that in our
scenario the determinant factors are the mass and the lifetime of the Cooperons

experimental and theoretical work. The former comprises the synthesis of

second osmotic virial coefficients in solvents of diverse quality as a function
of M via light scattering and osmotic pressures. The theoretical analysis is
performed by subdividing the dilution process into two clearly separable

containing three parameters. The parameter alpha measures the effect of contact
formation between solvent molecules and polymer segments at fixed chain
conformation, whereas the parameter zeta quantifies the contributions of the

the composition range of pair interaction between the macromolecules by means
of the three parameters alpha, zeta and lambda. This contribution presents the
extension of the approach to arbitrary volume fractions of the polymer and its
application to published data. The resulting equation is simple and requires
only the additional parameter ny to incorporate the composition dependence. Its
employment to experimental data is very much facilitated by substituting for
the limiting value of chi at infinite dilution. Furthermore the expression can
in good approximation be simplified such that only two parameters need to be
adjusted. This relation is capable of describing all types of composition
dependencies reported in the literature, including the hitherto
incomprehensible occurrence of pronounced minima. For a given system the
evaluation of the chain length dependence of chi at high dilution reported in
part I, and the present evaluation of the composition dependence of chi yield
the same values for the conformational response zeta. Similarly both types of
measurements generate the same interdependence between zeta and alpha. The
physical meaning of the different parameters and the reason for the observed

smallest length scale, has a discrete structure. This discrete structure takes
the form of a locally finite order relation, where the order, corresponding
with the macroscopic notion of spacetime causality, is taken to be a
fundamental aspect of nature.
  After an introduction to the Causal Set approach, this thesis considers a
simple toy dynamics for causal sets. Numerical simulations of the model provide
evidence for the existence of a continuum limit. While studying this toy
dynamics, a picture arises of how the dynamics can be generalized in such a way
that the theory could hope to produce more physically realistic causal sets. By
thinking in terms of a stochastic growth process, and positing some fundamental
principles, we are led almost uniquely to a family of dynamical laws
(stochastic processes) parameterized by a countable sequence of coupling
constants. This result is quite promising in that we now know how to speak of
dynamics for a theory with discrete time. In addition, these dynamics can be
expressed in terms of state models of Ising spins living on the relations of
the causal set, which indicates how non-gravitational matter may arise from the
theory without having to be built in at the fundamental level.
  These results are encouraging in that there exists a natural way to transform
this classical theory, which is expressed in terms of a probability measure, to
a quantum theory, expressed in terms of a quantum measure. A sketch as to how
one might proceed in doing this is provided. Thus there is good reason to
expect that Causal Sets are close to providing a background independent theory
of quantum gravity.

with noncollinear order, the multicritical behavior arising from the
competition of two distinct types of ordering with symmetry O($n_1$) and

thought of as responsible for the pair creation. However, we find that pair
creation still occurs with a finite rate formally similar to the classic
Schwinger result, but via an apparently different mechanism, involving a
combination of the Unruh effect and vacuum polarization due to the E-field.

of exterior and euclidean scalar product of multivectors. This permits the
introduction of two \emph{contraction operators} on $\bigwedge V,$ and the

theorem from those for which none is possible. Some classes (dense linear
orders, for instance) are non-classifiable in general, but are classifiable
when we consider only countable members. This paper explores such a notion for
classes of computable structures by working out several examples. One
motivation is to see whether some classes whose set of countable models is very
complex become classifiable when we consider only computable members.
  We follow recent work by Goncharov and Knight in using the degree of the
isomorphism problem for a class to distinguish classifiable classes from non-
classifiable. For some classes (undirected graphs, fields of fixed
characteristic, and real closed fields) we show that the isomorphism problem is
\Sigma^1_1 complete (the maximum possible), and for others it is of relatively
low complexity. For instance, for algebraically closed fields, archimedean real
closed fields, and vector spaces, we show that the isomorphism problem is
\Pi^0_3 complete.

Exact results about the momentum distribution at exact resonance are
established, both in the case of totally coherent dynamics and in the case when

when the kicking period is close to, but not exactly at resonance, is derived
by means of a quasi-classical approximation where the detuning from exact
resonance plays the role of the Planck constant. In this way scaling laws
describing the shape of the resonant peaks are obtained. Such analytical
results are supported by extensive numerical simulations, and explain some
recent surprising experimental observations.
