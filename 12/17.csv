Cloud and contains at least one known supernova remnant SNR0057-7226. Optical
emission from the remnant is overwhelmed by the bright photoionized emission
from the nebula, but the remnant has been detected by way of far ultraviolet
absorption lines. Here we present data from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic
Explorer (FUSE) satellite showing strong OVI and CIII emission from a position
at the edge of SNR0057-7226. We also present high-resolution, long-slit Halpha
spectra across N66 showing high- and low-velocity emission corresponding
closely to the X-ray boundaries of the supernova remnant. We use these FUV and
optical data to determine the physical parameters of the shock and interaction
geometry with N66. We find that ionizing photons from the many massive cluster
stars nearby likely affect the ionization balance in the post-shock gas,
hindering the production of lower-ionization and neutral species. We discuss
the importance and inherent difficulty of searching for supernova remnants in
or near bright HII regions and suggest that the far ultraviolet provides a
viable means to discover and study such remnants.

  (ApJ in press)","Astrophys.J.593:1-25,2003","10.1086/376517",,"astro-ph",,"  The halo occupation distribution (HOD) describes the bias between galaxies
and dark matter by specifying (a) the probability P(N|M) that a halo of virial
mass M contains N galaxies of a particular class and (b) the relative
distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos. We calculate predicted
HODs for a Lambda-CDM cosmological model using an SPH hydrodynamic simulation
and a semi-analytic (SA) galaxy formation model. Although the two methods
predict different galaxy mass functions, their HOD predictions agree remarkably
well. For mass-selected samples, the mean occupation <N(M)> exhibits a sharp
cutoff at low halo masses, a slowly rising plateau for <N>~1-2, and a more
steeply rising high occupancy regime. At low <N>, the mean pair and triple
counts are well below Poisson expectations, with important consequences for
small scale behavior of 2- and 3-point correlation functions. The HOD depends
strongly on galaxy age, with high mass halos populated mainly by old galaxies
and low mass halos by young galaxies. The SPH simulation supports several
simplifying assumptions about HOD bias: the most massive galaxy in a halo
usually lies close to the center and moves near the halo's mean velocity;
satellite galaxies have the same radial profile and velocity dispersion as the
dark matter; and the mean occupation at fixed halo mass is independent of the
halo's larger scale environment. By applying the SPH and SA HODs to a large
volume N-body simulation, we show that both methods predict slight, observable
departures from a power-law galaxy correlation function. The predicted HODs are
closely tied to the underlying galaxy formation physics, they offer useful
guidance to theoretical models of galaxy clustering, and they will be tested
empirically by ongoing analyses of galaxy redshift surveys. (Shortened)

CMB polarization. The proposed test is similar in spirit to the examination of
abundances of light elements produced during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and it
constitutes a way to study possible departures from standard recombination. For
simplicity we parametrize the change in the Friedmann equation by changing the
gravitational constant $G$. The main effect on the temperature power spectrum
is a change in the degree of damping of the acoustic peaks on small angular
scales. The effect can be compensated by a change in the shape of the
primordial power spectrum. We show that this degeneracy between the expansion
rate and the primordial spectrum can be broken by measuring CMB polarization.
In particular we show that the MAP satellite could obtain a constraint for the
expansion rate $H$ during recombination of $\delta H/H \simeq 0.09$ or $\delta
G/G \simeq 0.18$ after observing for four years, whereas Planck could obtain

evolutionary models computed for a 3Msun and solar metallicity star. First we
investigate the formation and the efficiency of the main neutron source. We
parametrically vary the number of protons mixed from the envelope into the C12
rich core. For p/C12 > 0.3, mainly N14 is produced, which represent a major
neutron poison. The amount of C12 in the He intershell and the maximum value of
the time-integrated neutron flux are proportional. Then we generate detailed
s-process calculations on the basis of stellar evolutionary models constructed
with three different codes. One code considers convective hydrodynamic
overshoot that depends on a free parameter f, and results in partial mixing
beyond convective boundaries, the most efficient third dredge up and the
formation of the C13 pocket. For the other two codes an identical C13 pocket is
introduced in the post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations. The models
generally reproduce the spectroscopically observed s-process enhancements. The
results of the cases without overshoot are remarkably similar. The code
including hydrodynamic overshoot produces a He intershell composition near to
that observed in H-deficient central stars of planetary nebulae. As a result of
this intershell dredge up the neutron fluxes have a higher efficiency, both
during the interpulse periods and within thermal pulses. The s-element
distribution is pushed toward the heavier s-process elements and large
abundances of neutron-rich isotopes fed by branching points in the s-process
path are produced. Several observational constraints are better matched by the
models without overshoot. Our study need to be extended to different masses and
metallicities and in the space of the free overshoot parameter f.

produce fast magnetosonic waves in the stellar crust which propagate toward the
surface and transform into outgoing electromagnetic radiation. The vortex
radiation has the spectral index -0.45 and can explain nonthermal radiation of
middle-aged pulsars observed in the infrared, optical and hard X-ray bands. The
radiation is produced in the stellar interior which allows direct determination
of the core temperature. Comparing the theory with available spectra
observations we find that the core temperature of the Vela pulsar is T=8*10^8K,
while the core temperature of PSR B0656+14 and Geminga exceeds 2*10^8K. This is
the first measurement of the temperature of a neutron star core. The

condensations of pions or kaons and quark matter in these objects. Based on the
temperature estimate and cooling models we determine the critical temperature
of triplet neutron superfluidity in the Vela core Tc=(7.5\pm 1.5)*10^9K which
agrees well with recent data on behavior of nucleon interactions at high

correlation function, Xi(sigma), and the real-space correlation function,
xi(r), which can be fit by a power-law, with r_0=5.05+/-0.26Mpc/h,
gamma_r=1.67+/-0.03. For r>20Mpc/h, xi drops below a power-law as is expected
in the popular LCDM model. The ratio of amplitudes of the real and
redshift-space correlation functions on scales of 8-30Mpc/h gives an estimate
of the redshift-space distortion parameter beta. The quadrupole moment of xi on
scales 30-40Mpc/h provides another estimate of beta. We also estimate the
distribution function of pairwise peculiar velocities, f(v), including
rigorously the effect of infall velocities, and find that it is well fit by an
exponential. The accuracy of our xi measurement is sufficient to constrain a
model, which simultaneously fits the shape and amplitude of xi(r) and the two
redshift-space distortion effects parameterized by beta and velocity
dispersion, a. We find beta=0.49+/-0.09 and a=506+/-52km/s, though the best fit
values are strongly correlated. We measure the variation of the peculiar
velocity dispersion with projected separation, a(sigma), and find that the
shape is consistent with models and simulations. Using the constraints on bias
from recent estimates, and taking account of redshift evolution, we conclude
that beta(L=L*,z=0)=0.47+/-0.08, and that the present day matter density of the

the efficiency of energy extraction process during the formation of the black
hole is linked in an essential way to the gravitational binding energy, the
formation of the horizon and the reduction of the kinetic energy of implosion.
Here a maximum efficiency of 50% in the extraction of the mass energy is shown
to be generally attainable in the collapse of a spherically symmetric shell:
surprisingly this result holds as well in the two limiting cases of the
Schwarzschild and extreme Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m space-times. Moreover, the
analytic expression recently found for the implosion of a spherical shell onto
an already formed black hole leads to a new exact analytic expression for the
energy extraction which results in an efficiency strictly less than 100% for
any physical implementable process. There appears to be no incompatibility
between General Relativity and Thermodynamics at this classical level.

considered. To derive the governing equations for the following car dynamics a
cost functional that ranks the outcomes of different driving strategies is
constructed, which applies to fairly general properties of the driver behavior.
Assuming the driver behavior to be rational, the existence of the Nash
equilibrium is proved. Rational driving is defined by supposing that a driver
corrects continuously the car motion to follow the optimal path minimizing the
cost functional. The corresponding car-following dynamics is described quite
generally by a boundary value problem based on the obtained extremal equations.
Linearization of these equations around the stationary state results in a
generalization of the widely used optimal velocity model. Moreover, it is shown
that there are conditions (the ``dense traffic'' limit) under which the
rational car dynamics comprises two stages, fast and slow. During the fast
stage a driver eliminates the velocity difference between the cars, the
subsequent slow stage optimizes the headway. In the ``dense traffic'' limit an
effective Hamiltonian description is constructed. This allows a more detailed
nonlinear analysis. Finally, the differences between rational and bounded
rational driver behavior are discussed. The latter, in particular, justifies
some basic assumptions used recently by the authors to construct a
car-following model lying beyond the frameworks of rationality.

investigated Mg$_{x}$$^{11}$B$_{2}$ samples with 0.8 $< x <$ 1.2. For the range

performed initial work on optimizing the formation of carbon doped MgB$_{2}$

interaction in copper benzoate. In the low field limit, the spin gap is found
to vary as $H^{2/3}\ln ^{1/6}(J/\mu_BH_s)$ ($H_s$: an effective staggered field
induced by the external field $H$)in agreement with the prediction of conformal
field theory, while the staggered magnetization varies as $H^{1/3}$ and the
$\ln^{1/3}(J/\mu_BH_s)$ correction predicted by conformal field theory is not
confirmed.The linear scaling relation between the momentum shift and the
magnetization is broken. We have determined the coupling constant of the DM
interaction and have given a complete quantitative account for the field
dependence of the spin gaps along all three principal axes, without resorting
to additional interactions like interchain coupling. A crossover to strong
applied field behavior is predicted for further experimental verification.

emphasizes the contribution of the proposed algorithm to find out communities

This approach allows us to draw, in a crossing-free manner, graphs--such as
software interaction diagrams--that would normally have many crossings. The
main idea of this approach is quite simple: we allow groups of edges to be
merged together and drawn as ""tracks"" (similar to train tracks). Producing such
confluent diagrams automatically from a graph with many crossings is quite
challenging, however, so we offer two heuristic algorithms to test if a
non-planar graph can be drawn efficiently in a confluent way. In addition, we
identify several large classes of graphs that can be completely categorized as
being either confluently drawable or confluently non-drawable.

sensitive to the moment of the invariant mass distribution which is used for
the determination, as well as the size of the quark-mixing matrix element

parametrizations for the forward amplitudes and the use of dispersion relation
techniques to study the total cross section $\sigma_{tot}$ and the $\rho$
parameter. In this paper we investigate four aspects related to the application
of the model to $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ scattering, from accelerator to cosmic-ray
energies: 1) the effect of different estimations for $\sigma_{tot}$ from
cosmic-ray experiments; 2) the differences between individual and global
(simultaneous) fits to $\sigma_{tot}$ and $\rho$; 3) the role of the
subtraction constant in the dispersion relations; 4) the effect of distinct
asymptotic inputs from different analytic models. This is done by using as a
framework the single Pomeron and the maximal Odderon parametrizations for the
total cross section. Our main conclusions are the following: 1) Despite the
small influence from different cosmic-ray estimations, the results allow us to
extract an upper bound for the soft pomeron intercept: $1 + \epsilon = 1.094$;
2) although global fits present good statistical results, in general, this
procedure constrains the rise of $\sigma_{tot}$; 3) the subtraction constant as
a free parameter affects the fit results at both low and high energies; 4)
independently of the cosmic-ray information used and the subtraction constant,
global fits with the odderon parametrization predict that, above $\sqrt s
\approx 70$ GeV, $\rho_{pp}(s)$ becomes greater than $\rho_{\bar{p}p}(s)$, and
this result is in complete agreement with all the data presently available. In
particular, we infer $\rho_{pp} = 0.134 \pm 0.005$ at $\sqrt s = 200$ GeV and
$0.151 \pm 0.007$ at 500 GeV (BNL RHIC energies).

Neutral Currents. First, we develop some new parametrizations of the 2HDM type
III, in such a way that the relation of it with models type I and type II
become apparent. Based on this parametrization we get some bounds on the mixing
vertex involving the second and third lepton generations, and lower bounds on
the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson. Further, by using a parametrization
in which one of the vacuum expectation values vanishes, we constrain some
lepton flavor violating vertices, based on the $g-2 $muon factor and some
lepton flavor violating decays. Moreover, upper limits on the decay widths of
$\tau \to e\gamma, $and $\tau \to eee $are calculated, finding them to stay far
from the reach of near future experiments. On the other hand, as an addendum to
this work, we study the production and decays of top squarks at the Tevatron
collider in models of low-energy supersymmetry breaking. We consider that the
lightest Standard Model superpartner is a light neutralino that predominantly
decays into a photon and a light gravitino, and that the lighter stop is the
next-to-lightest Standard Model superpartner. For a modest projection of the
final Tevatron luminosity, $L\simeq 4$ fb$^{-1}$, stop masses of order 300 GeV
are accessible. We also consider the production and decay of ten degenerate
squarks, and we find that common squark masses up to 360 GeV are easily
accessible, and that the reach increases further if the gluino is light.

the existence of antiparticles and show that a particle and its antiparticle
are different states of the same object. If i) is adopted then among the
Poincare, so(2,3) and so(1,4) algebras only the latter is a candidate for
constructing elementary particle theory. We extend our analysis in
hep-th/0210144 and prove that: 1) UIRs of the so(1,4) algebra can indeed be
interpreted in the framework of i) and cannot be interpreted in the framework
of the standard approach; 2) as a consequence of a new symmetry (called AB one)
between particles and antiparticles for UIRs satisfying i), elementary
particles described by UIRs of the so(1,4) algebra can be only fermions; 3) as
a consequence of the AB symmetry, the vacuum condition can be consistent only
for particles with the half-integer spin (in conventional units) and therefore
only such particles can be elementary. In our approach the well known fact that
fermions have imaginary parity is a consequence of the AB symmetry.

has an inverse and every object x has a `weak inverse': an object y such that x
tensor y and y tensor x are isomorphic to 1. A coherent 2-group is a weak

asymptotically close to the (stable) front solution of the `trivial' scalar
bi-stable limit system $u_t = u_{xx} + u(1-u^2)$. However, in the system these

either caused by the essential spectrum associated to the linearized stability

the Evans function to study the various bifurcation mechanisms and establish an
explicit connection between the character of the destabilization and the
possible appearance of saddle-node bifurcations of heteroclinic orbits in the

For finite symmetric groups the question of the size of maximal Abelian

We show that there is not much interest in generalizing this study to infinite

the size of maximal Abelian subgroups for a class of groups closely related to
the the symmetric group of the integers; these arise by taking an ideal on the
integers, considering the subgroup of all permutations which respect the ideal

allows a study of both the long time, $t\to\infty$, and semi-classical,
$\hbar\to 0$, limits taken in either order. We evaluate the expression using
random matrix theory as well as numerically, and observe good agreement between
both sets of results. The long time limit shows that particle transport is
generically ballistic, for any fixed value of Planck's constant. However, for
fixed times, the semi-classical limit leads to diffusion. The mean square
displacement for non-zero Planck's constant, and finite time, exhibits a
crossover from diffusive to ballistic motion, with crossover time on the order
of the inverse of Planck's constant. We argue, that these results are generic
for a large class of 1D quantum random walks, similar to the quantum
multi-baker, and that a sufficient condition for diffusion in the
semi-classical limit is classically chaotic dynamics in each cell. Some
connections between our work and the other literature on quantum random walks
are discussed. These walks are of some interest in the theory of quantum

recently predicted analytical upper and lower bounds. We focus on reaction
enhancement and quenching phenomena for two classes of imposed model flows with
different geometries: periodic shear flow and cellular flow. We are primarily
interested in the fast advection regime. We find that the bulk burning rate v
in a shear flow satisfies v ~ a*U+b where U is the typical flow velocity and a
is a constant depending on the relationship between the oscillation length
scale of the flow and laminar front thickness. For cellular flow, we obtain v ~
U^{1/4}. We also study flame extinction (quenching) for an ignition-type
reaction law and compactly supported initial data for the scalar field. We find
that in a shear flow the flame of the size W can be typically quenched by a
flow with amplitude U ~ alpha*W. The constant alpha depends on the geometry of
the flow and tends to infinity if the flow profile has a plateau larger than a
critical size. In a cellular flow, we find that the advection strength required
for quenching is U ~ W^4 if the cell size is smaller than a critical value.

give rise to entanglement measures. It is well known that asymptotic local
operations and classical communication (LOCC) are required to get a simple
operational measure of bipartite pure state entanglement. For bipartite mixed
states and multipartite pure states it is likely that a more powerful class of
operations will be needed. To this end \cite{BPRST01} have defined more
powerful versions of state transformations (or reducibilities), namely LOCCq
(asymptotic LOCC with a sublinear amount of quantum communication) and CLOCC
(asymptotic LOCC with catalysis). In this paper we show that {\em LOCCq state
transformations are only as powerful as asymptotic LOCC state transformations}
for multipartite pure states. We first generalize the concept of entanglement
gambling from two parties to multiple parties: any pure multipartite entangled
state can be transformed to an EPR pair shared by some pair of parties and that
any irreducible $m$ $(m\ge 2)$ party pure state can be used to create any other
state (pure or mixed), using only local operations and classical communication
(LOCC). We then use this tool to prove the result. We mention some applications
of multipartite entanglement gambling to multipartite distillability and to
characterizations of multipartite minimal entanglement generating sets. Finally
we discuss generalizations of this result to mixed states by defining the class
of {\em cat distillable states}.
