were taken with filters both in and out of strong emission lines, and together

strong emission lines (e.g., [O III] 5007 A and H alpha+[N II]) contribute to
the broad-band fluxes much more significantly than previously estimated (80%
vs. 20-40%), and that when the continuum sources are imaged through line-free
filters, they show an extremely compact morphology with a high surface
brightness. If we use the R^1/4-law parametrization, their effective radii
(r(e)) are only 2-3 kpc while their restframe B-band surface brightnesses at
r(e) are I(B) ~ 18 mag/arcsec^2. Compared with z ~ 1 3CR radio galaxies, the
former is x3-5 smaller, while the latter is 1-1.5 mag brighter than what is
predicted from the I(B)-r(e) correlation. Although exponential profiles produce
equally good fits for 4C 40.36 and 4C 39.37, this clearly indicates that with
respect to the z~1 3CR radio galaxies, the light distribution of these two
HzRGs is much more centrally concentrated. Spectroscopically, 4C 40.36 shows a
flat (fnu=const) continuum while 4C 39.37 shows a spectrum as red as that of a
local giant elliptical galaxy. Although this difference may be explained in
terms of a varying degree of star formation, the similarities of their surface
brightness profiles and the submillimeter detection of 4C 39.37 might suggest
that the intrinsic spectra is equally blue (young stars or an AGN), and that
the difference is the amount of reddening.

it will enable us to observationally determine the exact epoch of the

Camera for Surveys (ACS) coming on line, we now have an unique opportunity to
discover a significant number of objects at z ~ 6. The pure parallel mode
implemented for the Wide Field Camera (WFC) has greatly enhanced this ability.
We present our preliminary analysis of a deep ACS/WFC parallel field at
|b|=74.4^o. We find 30 plausible z ~ 6 candidates, all of which have S/N > 7 in

z <= 6.5 as 2.3 arcmin^{-2} to a limit of 28.0 mag in the F850LP-band, which is
slightly higher than our prediction. If this is not due to an underestimated
contamination rate, it could possibly imply that the faint-end slope of the z ~
6 luminosity function is steeper than alpha=-1.6. At the very least, our result
suggests that galaxies with L<L^* do exist in significant number at z ~ 6 and
they could be the major sources that contributed to the reionizing photons.

defects is proposed, which acts in the opposite direction compared with Frenkel
pair production, and it results in the radiation-induced recovery processes.
The vacancy emission from a void surface results in a shrinkage of the void
which is analogous to the thermal void shrinkage at high temperatures, but it
is expected to operate at low and medium temperatures and high sink densities,
when the radiation-induced vacancy emission from sinks becomes comparable with
the absorption of Frenkel defects produced in the bulk. As a result, the void
growth becomes negative below a threshold temperature (or above a threshold
flux), and saturates after a threshold irradiation dose, at a level, which
depends on the type of material. These effects have been observed
experimentally for a long time but could not be explained by the conventional
theory. One of the technologically important consequences of the new concept is
a mechanism of irradiation creep, based on the radiation and stress induced
preference emission, which is essentially temperature independent in contrast
to the well-known SIPA or elastodiffusion mechanisms that can yield a
significant irradiation creep only when recombination is negligible. The
efficiency of the radiation-induced Schottky defect emission is different for
different types of materials, which is shown to be one of the major causes of
their different responses to irradiation.

in real time by implementing the dynamical renormalization group. The
conductivity is obtained from the realtime dependence of a dissipative kernel
related to the retarded photon polarization. Pinch singularities in the
imaginary part of the polarization are manifest as growing secular terms that
in the perturbative expansion of this kernel. The leading secular terms are
studied explicitly and it is shown that they are insensitive to the anomalous
damping of hard fermions as a result of a cancellation between self-energy and
vertex corrections. The resummation of the secular terms via the dynamical
renormalization group leads directly to a renormalization group equation in
real time, which is the Boltzmann equation for the (gauge invariant) fermion
distribution function. A direct correspondence between the perturbative
expansion and the linearized Boltzmann equation is established, allowing a
direct identification of the self energy and vertex contributions to the
collision term.We obtain a Fokker-Planck equation in momentum space that
describes the dynamics of the departure from equilibrium to leading logarithmic
order in the coupling.This determines that the transport time scale is given by
t_{tr}=(24 pi)/[e^4 T \ln(1/e)}]. The solution of the Fokker-Planck equation
approaches asymptotically the steady- state solution as sim e^{-t/(4.038

case, holomorphy and symmetries do not forbid non-planar contributions.
Nevertheless, only a special subset of the planar diagrams contributes to the
exact result. Some of the data of this subset can be computed from the large-N
limit of an associated multi-trace Matrix model. However, the prescription
differs in important respects from that of Dijkgraaf and Vafa for single-trace
superpotentials in that the field theory effective action is not the derivative
of a multi-trace matrix model free energy. The basic subtlety involves the
correct identification of the field theory glueball as a variable in the Matrix
model, as we show via an auxiliary construction involving a single-trace matrix
model with additional singlet fields which are integrated out to compute the
multi-trace results. Along the way we also describe a general technique for
computing the large-N limits of multi-trace Matrix models and raise the
challenge of finding the field theories whose effective actions they may
compute. Since our models can be treated as N = 1 deformations of pure N =2
gauge theory, we show that the effective superpotential that we compute also
follows from the N = 2 Seiberg-Witten solution. Finally, we observe an
interesting connection between multi-trace local theories and non-local field

result extends previous Lipschitzian regularity results to cover optimal

hypernuclei has been developed.It involves a partial wave expansion of the
emitted nucleon waves,preserves naturally the antisymmetrization between the
escaping particles and the residual core, and contains as a particular case the
weak Lambda-core coupling formalism. The hypernuclei are grouped having in view
their A-1 cores, that is in those with even-even, even-odd and odd-odd cores.It
is shown that in all three cases the nuclear structure manifests itself
basically through Pauli Principle, and very simple expressions are derived for
the neutron and proton induced decays rates, which does not involve the
spectroscopic factors.

interpretation of the PV quasielastic asymmetry is, thus, largely unaffected by
hadronic PV.

navigation receiver) is formulated based on electromagnetic theory. The model
shows that the phase of the open-circuit voltage induced in the receiver
antenna with respect to a local oscillator (in the receiver) depends on the
relative orientation of the receiving and transmitting antennas. The model
shows that using a {\it single} receiving antenna, and making carrier phase
measurements to seven satellites, the 3-axis attitude of a user platform (in
addition to its position and time) can be computed relative to an initial
point. This measurement model can also be used to create high-fidelity
satellite signal simulators that take into account the effect of platform
rotation as well as translation.

is shown to lead to amplitude fluctuations as large as 50 % for certain input

measurements and numerical simulations with a generalized stochastic nonlinear
Schroedinger equation, finding good quantitative agreement over a range of
input pulse energies and chirp values. This noise is shown to arise from
nonlinear amplification of two quantum noise inputs: the input pulse shot noise
and the spontaneous Raman scattering down the fiber.

The fit gives the first value for the bending stiffness of the overstretched
state as about 10 nm*kbt, a value quite different from either B-form or

channel for short distance quantum communications. The state to be transmitted
is placed on one spin of the chain and received later on a distant spin with
some fidelity. We first obtain simple expressions for the fidelity of quantum
state transfer and the amount of entanglement sharable between any two sites of
an arbitrary Heisenberg ferromagnet using our scheme. We then apply this to the
realizable case of an open ended chain with nearest neighbor interactions. The
fidelity of quantum state transfer is obtained as an inverse discrete cosine
transform and as a Bessel function series. We find that in a reasonable time, a
qubit can be directly transmitted with better than classical fidelity across
the full length of chains of up to 80 spins. Moreover, the spin-chain channel
allows distillable entanglement to be shared over arbitrarily large distances.
