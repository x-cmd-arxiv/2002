  Ser.), eds M. Bailes, D.J. Nice, & S.E.Thorsett",,,,"astro-ph gr-qc",,"  Recent theoretical work has made it plausible for neutron stars (NSs) to lose
angular momentum via gravitational radiation on long timescales (around Myrs)
while actively accreting. The gravitational waves (GWs) can either be emitted
via the excitation of r-modes or from a deformed crust. GW emission can thus
intervene to slow-down or halt the otherwise relentless spin-up from accretion.
Prior to this theoretical work (and the measurements of NS rotation rates in
LMXBs) the community was rather confident that an accreting NS would be spun-up
to rotation rates near breakup, motivating searches for sub-millisecond
objects. After only briefly describing the physics of the GW processes, I argue
that the limiting spin frequency might be appreciably lower than the breakup
frequency. Millisecond radio pulsar observers would likely discover the impact
of GW emission as a dropoff in the number of pulsars beyond 600 Hz, and I show
here that the millisecond pulsar inventory in 47 Tuc might already exhibit such
a cutoff. These theoretical ideas will be tested by GW searches with
ground-based interferometers, such as the advanced LIGO instrument proposed for
operation by 2008.

flat, but leaves open the question of whether it is simply or multiply
connected. Several authors have investigated whether the topology of a multiply
connect hyperbolic universe would be detectable when 0.9 < Omega < 1. However,
the possibility of detecting a given topology varies depending on the location
of the observer within the space. Recent studies have assumed the observer sits
at a favorable location. The present paper extends that work to consider
observers at all points in the space, and (for given values of Omega_m and
Omega_Lambda and a given topology) computes the probability that a randomly
placed observer could detect the topology. The computations show that when
Omega = 0.98 a randomly placed observer has a reasonable chance (~50%) of
detecting a hyperbolic topology, but when Omega = 0.99 the chances are low
(<10%) and decrease still further as Omega approaches one.

the literature which accurately approximate some general relativistic effects
important for studying accretion discs around a Schwarzschild black hole. Such

mimic the space-time around a non-rotating/slowly rotating compact object. In
this paper, we examine the validity of the application of some of these
potentials to study the spherically symmetric, transonic, hydrodynamic
accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole. By comparing the values of various
dynamical and thermodynamic accretion parameters obtained for flows using these
potentials with full general relativistic calculations, we have shown that
though the potentials discussed in this paper were originally proposed to mimic
the relativistic effects manifested in disc accretion, it is quite reasonable
to use most of the potentials in studying various dynamical as well as
thermodynamic quantities for spherical accretion to compromise between the ease
of handling of a Newtonian description of gravity and the realistic situations
described by complicated general relativistic calculations. Also we have shown
that depending on the chosen regions of parameter space spanned by specific
energy ${\cal E}$ and adiabatic index $\gamma$ of the flow, one potential may
have more importance than another and we could identify which potential is the
best approximation for full general relativistic flow in Scwarzschild
space-time for particular values of ${\cal E}$ and $\gamma$.

dynamical bosonic collective modes of the fermionic vacuum interact with the
chiral fermions as the effective gravity and gauge fields. The relativistic
invariance, the chirality of fermions, the gauge and gravity fields, the
relativistic spin, etc., are the emergent low-energy properties of the quantum

vacuum of superfluid 3He-A belong to this universality class and thus they are

affine Lie algebra $\ag$ corresponding to $\Gamma$. If we replace homology
groups by equivariant $K$-homology groups, we get a representation of the
quantum toroidal algebra $\Ut$. We also discuss a higher rank generalization
and character formulas in terms of intersection homology groups.

geometry and topology. The study of the Yang-Mills equation and its cousins

results for low dimensional manifolds, particularly, 4-manifolds. The theory of
Gromov-Witten invariants was established by using solutions of the
Cauchy-Riemann equation. These solutions are often refered as
pseudo-holomorphic maps which are special minimal surfaces studied long in
geometry. It is certainly not the end of applications of nonlinear partial
differential equations to geometry. In this talk, we will discuss some recent
progress on nonlinear partial differential equations in geometry. We will be

The Gaussian case can be treated algorithmically using the famous Kalman
filter. Similarly since the 1970s there has been extensive application of
Hidden Markov models in speech recognition with prediction being the most
important goal. The basic theoretical work here, in the case $X$ and $Y$ finite
(small) providing both algorithms and asymptotic analysis for inference is that
of Baum and colleagues. During the last 30-40 years these general models have
proved of great value in applications ranging from genomics to finance.
  Unless the $X,Y$ are jointly Gaussian or $X$ is finite and small the problem
of calculating the distributions discussed and the likelihood exactly are
numerically intractable and if $Y$ is not finite asymptotic analysis becomes
much more difficult. Some new developments have been the construction of
so-called ``particle filters'' (Monte Carlo type) methods for approximate
calculation of these distributions (see Doucet et al. [4]) for instance and
general asymptotic methods for analysis of statistical methods in HMM [2] and
other authors.
  We will discuss these methods and results in the light of exponential mixing
properties of the conditional (posterior) distribution of $(X_1,X_2,...)$ given
$(Y_1,Y_2,...)$ already noted by Baum and Petrie and recent work of the authors
Bickel, Ritov and Ryden, Del Moral and Jacod, Douc and Matias.

cumulative distribution function (CDF) from independent random variables. If
the variables are uniformly distributed then these centered CDFs converge in a
suitable sense to the sample paths of a Brownian Bridge. The so-called
Hungarian construction of Komlos, Major and Tusnady provides a strong form of
this result. In this construction the CDFs and the Brownian Bridge sample paths
are coupled through an appropriate representation of each on the same
measurable space, and the convergence is uniform at a suitable rate.
  Within the last decade several asymptotic statistical-equivalence theorems
for nonparametric problems have been proven, beginning with Brown and Low
(1996) and Nussbaum (1996). The approach here to statistical-equivalence is
firmly rooted within the asymptotic statistical theory created by L. Le Cam but
in some respects goes beyond earlier results.
  This talk demonstrates the analogy between these results and those from the
coupling method for proving stochastic process limit theorems. These two
classes of theorems possess a strong inter-relationship, and technical methods
from each domain can profitably be employed in the other. Results in a recent
paper by Carter, Low, Zhang and myself will be described from this perspective.

strong evidence for formation of a thermalized quark-gluon plasma at RHIC.
Strong radial flow reflects high thermal pressure in the reaction zone. Large
elliptic flow proves that the pressure builds up quickly and the system
thermalizes on a very short time scale of less than 1 fm/c. The observed hadron
yields are consistent with statistical hadron formation from a quark-gluon
plasma, followed by immediate chemical decoupling due to strong radial
expansion. The observed suppression of jets appears to confirm the predicted
large energy loss suffered by hard partons moving through a quark-gluon plasma;
more work is required to quantitatively understand this effect. Source size
measurements using two-particle correlations do not seem to fit into this
picture; the origin of this discrepancy (``HBT puzzle'') is presently not
understood.

designed and tested the first nuclear weapon (the gadget), had a lot of
