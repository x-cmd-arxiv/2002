UBVRIJHK. We confirm the finding of Li et al. regarding the unusually blue B-V
colors as SN 2000cx entered the nebular phase. Its I-band secondary hump was
extremely weak given its B-band decline rate. The V minus near infrared colors
likewise do not match loci based on other slowly declining Type Ia SNe, though
V-K is the least ``abnormal''. In several ways SN 2000cx resembles other slow
decliners, given its B-band decline rate (Delta m_15(B) = 0.93), the appearance
of Fe III lines and weakness of Si II in its pre-maximum spectrum, the V-K
colors and post-maximum V-H colors. If the distance modulus derived from
Surface Brightness Fluctuations of the host galaxy is correct, we find that the
rate of light increase prior to maximum, the characteristics of the bolometric
light curve, and the implied absolute magnitude at maximum are all consistent
with a sub-luminous object with Delta m_15(B) ~ 1.6-1.7 having a higher than

at 2.2 micron lies close to the power law extrapolation from radio frequencies,
showing that relativistic particle acceleration is likely an ongoing process;
the infrared emitting electrons were accelerated no longer than ~80 years ago.
There is a small but significant concave curvature to the spectrum, as expected
if the accelerating shocks have been modified by the back pressure of the
cosmic rays; given calibration uncertainties, this conclusion must be
considered tentative at present. The 2.2 micron polarization angles and the
emission-line filaments observed by HST are both offset from the local radial

moderately metal-rich stars, with a peak at [m/H] $\simeq$ -0.4 and with a very
small fraction of metal-poor ([m/H] $<$ -1.0) stars. In order to investigate
the physical processes which may have produced this metallicity distribution
function (MDF), we consider a model in which NGC 5128 is formed by merging of
two major spiral galaxies. We find that the halo of an elliptical formed this
way is predominantly populated by moderately metal-rich stars with [m/H] $\sim$
-0.4 which were initially within the outer parts of the two merging discs and
were tidally stripped during the merger. To match the NGC 5128 data, we find
that the progenitor spiral discs must have rather steep metallicity gradients
similar to the one defined by the Milky Way open clusters, as well as sparse
metal-poor haloes (5% or less of the disc mass). Very few stars from the
central bulges of the spiral galaxies end up in the halo, so the results are
not sensitive to the relative sizes (bulge-to-disc ratios) or metallicities of
the initial bulges. Finally, we discuss the effects on the globular cluster
system (GCS). The emergent elliptical will end up with metal-poor halo clusters
from the original spiral haloes, but with moderately metal-rich halo stars from
the progenitor discs, thus creating a mean offset between the MDFs of the halo
stars and the GCS.

distorted spiral or ring galaxy likely disrupted by a collision or close
encounter with a southern galaxy (A194S). There is evidence that a third galaxy
with similar recession velocity is projected on A194N but its role is likely
secondary. A194S is connected to A194N by a string of emission knots which
motivates our interpretation that the former was the intruder. Three of the
knots are easily discernible in B,R, and H-alpha images and are assumed to
trace the path of the intruder following the encounter, which we estimate
occurred a few 10^8 yr ago.
  Both A194S and N are experiencing strong bursts of star formation: the
H-alpha luminosity indicates a total star formation rate ~ 10 solar masses per
year. The lack of detectable J and K emission from the blobs, along with strong
H-alpha emission, indicates that an evolved stellar population is not likely to
be present. The brightest knot (closest to A194S) shows a star formation rate
of ~1.2 solar masses per year which, if sustained over a time ~ 7 10^7 yr,
could explain the spectral energy distribution. This suggests that the stripped
matter was originally predominantly gaseous. The brightest knot is detected as
a FIRST radio source and this is likely the signature of supernova remnants
related to enhanced star formation. Motions in the gas between the brightest
knot and A194S, traced by an emission line link of increasing radial velocity,
suggests infall toward the center of the intruder. Arp 194 is therefore one of

near 1/3 coverage. First, a phase is formed which is characterized by a
uniaxially compressed incommensurate solid with additional mass density
modulations along the same direction which can be viewed as an ordered
domain-wall solid with a characteristic domain-wall distance which depends on
the surface coverage. At low temperature and higher coverage there is a
transition to an incommensurate solid which is rotated relative to the
substrate commensurate lattice. As a function of temperature the domain-wall
ordering first melts into a fluid of domain-walls and at higher temperature the
solid melts into a uniform fluid. Regardless of the large amplitude of quantum
fluctuations, these phase transitions are analogous to those in classical
monolayer films. Our calculated values for the surface coverage and temperature
where these transitions occur, the calculated structure factors and specific

the anomalous Pioneer spacecraft acceleration, a spin-up of the Earth and an
apparent variation of G observed from analysis of the evolution of planetary
longitudes. These conundrums may be resolved in the theory of Self Creation
Cosmology, in which the Principle of Mutual Interaction subsumes both Mach's
Principle and the Local Conservation of Energy. The theory is conformally
equivalent to General Relativity in vacuo with the consequence that predictions
of the theory are identical with General Relativity in the standard solar
system experiments. Other observable local and cosmological consequences offer
an explanation for the anomalies above. The SCC universe expands linearly in
its Einstein Frame and it is static in its Jordan Frame; hence, as there are no
density, smoothness or horizon problems, there is no requirement for Inflation.
The theory determines the total density parameter to be one third, and the cold
dark matter density parameter to be two ninths, yet in the Jordan frame the
universe is similar to Einstein's original static cylindrical model and
spatially flat. Therefore there is no need for a 'Dark Energy' hypothesis. As
the field equations determine the false vacuum energy density to be a specific,
and feasibly small, value there is no 'Lambda Problem'. Finally certain
observations in SCC would detect cosmic acceleration.

manner. The holographic RG is based on the idea that the radial coordinate of a
space-time with asymptotically AdS geometry can be identified with the RG flow
parameter of the boundary field theory. After briefly discussing basic aspects
of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we explain how the notion of the holographic RG
comes out in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We formulate the holographic RG based
on the Hamilton-Jacobi equations for bulk systems of gravity and scalar fields,
as was introduced by de Boer, Verlinde and Verlinde. We then show that the
equations can be solved with a derivative expansion by carefully extracting
local counterterms from the generating functional of the boundary field theory.
The calculational methods to obtain the Weyl anomaly and scaling dimensions are
presented and applied to the RG flow from the N=4 SYM to an N=1 superconformal
fixed point discovered by Leigh and Strassler. We further discuss a relation
between the holographic RG and the noncritical string theory, and show that the
structure of the holographic RG should persist beyond the supergravity
approximation as a consequence of the renormalizability of the nonlinear sigma
model action of noncritical strings. As a check, we investigate the holographic
RG structure of higher-derivative gravity systems, and show that such systems
can also be analyzed based on the Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and that the
behaviour of bulk fields are determined solely by their boundary values. We
also point out that higher-derivative gravity systems give rise to new
multicritical points in the parameter space of the boundary field theories.

trace $T=T^{a}_a$ of energy momentum tensor of all the fields (including
itself). In the case of a shallow exponential potential, the presence of
coupling to the trace $T$ in the field equation makes the energy density of the
scalar field decrease faster thereby hastening the commencement of radiation
domination. This effect gradually diminishes at later epochs allowing the
scalar field to dominate the energy density again. We interpret this phase as
the current epoch of cosmic acceleration with $\Omega_{\phi}=0.7$. A variant of
this model can lead to accelerated expansion at the present epoch followed by a
$a(t)\propto t^{2/3}$ behaviour as $t\to \infty$, making the model free from
future event horizon. The main features of the model are independent of initial
conditions. However, fine tuning of parameters is necessary for viable
evolution.

layers. Thus the issue of adequate theoretical interpretation of the evolution
of localized vortices is again on the agenda.

  Relations Imply a General Physical Principle ?","4 pages, LaTeX, no figure",,,,"quant-ph",,"  It is explicitly shown that there exist physical states (normalized to 1) in
which the Robertson- Schr\""{o}dinger and Heisenberg uncertainty relations are
invalid, namely, the mean values of the physical operators are infinite.
Consequently, these relations cannot imply a general physical principle. The
explanation by the theory of functional analysis is given : for these states
even the definition of the uncertainty notion through the dispersion notion in
the probability theory is irrelevant.

  Quantum Information Science 2002 (September, 2002, Tokyo, Japan). Our idea is
  sketched in Section 1 for convenience","Quant. Info. Comp. 2 (Special), 540-555 (2002)",,,"quant-ph",,"  We classify multipartite entanglement in a unified manner, focusing on a
duality between the set of separable states and that of entangled states.
Hyperdeterminants, derived from the duality, are natural generalizations of
entanglement measures, the concurrence, 3-tangle for 2, 3 qubits respectively.
Our approach reveals how inequivalent multipartite entangled classes of pure
states constitute a partially ordered structure under local actions,
significantly different from a totally ordered one in the bipartite case.
Moreover, the generic entangled class of the maximal dimension, given by the
nonzero hyperdeterminant, does not include the maximally entangled states in
Bell's inequalities in general (e.g., in the 4 or more qubits), contrary to the
widely known bipartite or 3-qubit cases. It suggests that not only are they
never locally interconvertible with the majority of multipartite entangled
states, but they would have no grounds for the canonical n-partite entangled
states. Our classification is also useful for that of mixed states.
