  Astronomical Telescopes and Instrumentation",,"10.1117/12.459065",,"astro-ph",,"  The trend towards ever larger telescopes and more advanced adaptive optics
systems is driving the need for deformable mirrors with a large number of low
cost actuators. Liquid mirrors have long been recognized a potential low cost
alternative to conventional solid mirrors. By using a water or oil based
ferrofluid we are able to benefit from a stronger magnetic response than is
found in magnetic liquid metal amalgams and avoid the difficulty of passing a
uniform current through a liquid. Depositing a thin silver colloid known as a
metal liquid-like film (MELLF) on the ferrofluid surface solves the problem of
low reflectivity of pure ferrofluids. This combination provides a liquid
optical surface that can be precisely shaped in a magnetic field. We present
experimental results obtained with a prototype deformable liquid mirror based
on this combination.

signs of strong high-velocity components in O VI absorption along the Galactic
sight lines, which indicates the general absence of high velocity O VI within
2-5 kpc of the Galactic mid-plane. The correlation between the H I and O VI
intermediate velocity absorption is also poor. The O VI velocity dispersions
are much larger than the value of ~18 km/s expected from thermal broadening for
gas at T~300,000 K, the temperature at which O VI is expected to reach its peak
abundance in collisional ionization equilibrium. Turbulence, inflow, and
outflow must have an effect on the shape of the O VI profiles. Kinematical
comparisons of O VI with Ar I suggest the presence of two different types of O
VI-bearing environments toward the Galactic sight lines. Comparison of O VI

primarily by cooling hot gas in the Galactic fountain flow, and that turbulent

located within tens of parsecs of the GRB site long after the afterglow has
faded away. The scattered flux directly measures the typical density of the GRB
ambient medium. Furthemore, if the primary emission is beamed, the scattered
X-ray flux will be slowly decreasing for several months to years before falling
off rapidly. Therefore, it should be possible to estimate the collimation angle

gas phase, those occurring on the surfaces of dust grains play an essential
role. Chemical models based on rate equations including both gas phase and
grain surface reactions have been used in order to simulate the formation of
chemical complexity in interstellar clouds. For reactions in the gas phase and
on large grains, rate equations, which are highly efficient to simulate, are an
ideal tool. However, for small grains under low flux, the typical number of
atoms or molecules of certain reactive species on a grain may go down to order
one or less. In this case the discrete nature of the opulations of reactive
species as well as the fluctuations become dominant, thus the mean-field
approximation on which the rate equations are based does not apply. Recently, a
master equation approach, that provides a good description of chemical
reactions on interstellar dust grains, was proposed. Here we present a related
approach based on moment equations that can be obtained from the master
equation. These equations describe the time evolution of the moments of the
distribution of the population of the various chemical species on the grain. An
advantage of this approach is the fact that the production rates of molecular
species are expressed directly in terms of these moments. Here we use the
moment equations to calculate the rate of molecular hydrogen formation on small
grains. It is shown that the moment equation approach is efficient in this case
in which only a single reactive specie is involved. The set of equations for
the case of two species is presented and the difficulties in implementing this
approach for complex reaction networks involving multiple species are
discussed.

long-period (e.g. Mira) variables (LPV). The effect of a revised chromaticity
correction, which accounts for the color variations along the light cycle, was
then investigated. It is based on `instantaneous' $V-I$ color indices derived
from Hipparcos and Tycho-2 epoch photometry. Among the 188 LPVs flagged as VIM
in the Hipparcos catalogue, 89 (47%) are not confirmed as VIM after this
improved chromaticity correction is applied. This dramatic decrease in the
number of VIM solutions is not surprising, since the chromaticity correction
applied by the Hipparcos reduction consortia was based on a fixed $V-I$ color.
Astrophysical considerations lead us to adopt a more stringent criterion for
accepting a VIM solution (first-kind risk of 0.27% instead of 10% as in the
Hipparcos catalogue). With this more severe criterion, only 27 LPV stars remain
VIM, thus rejecting 161 of the 188 (86%) of the LPVs defined as VIMs in the

anisotropic alpha-effect (alpha_zz = 0) leads to the nonaxisymmetric solutions
as it is confirmed by the Karlsruhe dynamo experiment. However, one of the
antisymmetric parts of the alpha-tensor basically plays the role of a
differential rotation in the induction equation. Using for the radial profile
of this effect the results of anumerical simulation for the alpha-tensor of the

describe the ``coarse-grained'' dynamics. In a coarse-grained sense, the system
is expected to reach an equilibrium state of a Fermi-Dirac type within a few
dynamical times. We describe in detail the equilibrium phase diagram and the
nature of phase transitions which occur in self-gravitating systems. Then, we
introduce a small-scale parametrization of the Vlasov equation and propose a
set of relaxation equations for the coarse-grained dynamics. These relaxation
equations, of a generalized Fokker-Planck type, are derived from a Maximum

AWAXS measurements were performed at eight different incident photon energies,
including some close to the Ni and Zr K edges. From the measurements eight
total structure factor S(K,E) were derived. Using the AWAXS data four
differential structure factors DSFi(K,Em,En) were derived, two about the Ni and
Zr edges. The partial structure factors SNi-Ni(K), SNi-Zr(K) and SZr-Zr(K) were
estimated by using two different methods. First, the S(K,E) and DSFi(K,Em,En)
factors were combined and used in a matrix inversion process. Second, three
S(K,E) factors were used as input data in the RMC technique. The coordination
numbers and interatomic distances for the first neighbors extracted from the

By using the three-dimensional structure derived from the RMC simulations, the

distorted triangular-faced polyhedral units in the amorphous NiZr2 structure.
We have used the Warren chemical short-range order parameter to evaluate the

enhancement of fracture energy is due to far-field viscous dissipation in the

it feasible to generate keyphrases for the huge number of documents that do not
have manually assigned keyphrases. Good performance on this task has been
obtained by approaching it as a supervised learning problem. An input document
is treated as a set of candidate phrases that must be classified as either
keyphrases or non-keyphrases. To classify a candidate phrase as a keyphrase,
the most important features (attributes) appear to be the frequency and
location of the candidate phrase in the document. Recent work has demonstrated
that it is also useful to know the frequency of the candidate phrase as a
manually assigned keyphrase for other documents in the same domain as the given
document (e.g., the domain of computer science). Unfortunately, this
keyphrase-frequency feature is domain-specific (the learning process must be
repeated for each new domain) and training-intensive (good performance requires
a relatively large number of training documents in the given domain, with
manually assigned keyphrases). The aim of the work described here is to remove
these limitations. In this paper, I introduce new features that are derived by
mining lexical knowledge from a very large collection of unlabeled data,
consisting of approximately 350 million Web pages without manually assigned
keyphrases. I present experiments that show that the new features result in
improved keyphrase extraction, although they are neither domain-specific nor

designed to probe the network of cultural and perceptual associations that
humans naturally develop as we live, embodied and embedded in the world. In
this paper, I show how it is possible for a disembodied computer to answer
subcognitive questions appropriately, contrary to French's claim. My approach
to answering subcognitive questions is to use statistical information extracted
from a very large collection of text. In particular, I show how it is possible
to answer a sample of subcognitive questions taken from French, by issuing
queries to a search engine that indexes about 350 million Web pages. This
simple algorithm may shed light on the nature of human (sub-) cognition, but
the scope of this paper is limited to demonstrating that French is mistaken: a
disembodied computer can answer subcognitive questions.

non-negative Ricci scalar, which leads to a Penrose inequality if the apparent

of Malec, Mars and Simon which holds for general horizons and for data
satisfying the dominant energy condition, but imposes (in addition to smooth
inverse mean curvature flow) suitable restrictions on the data on a spacelike
surface. These conditions can, however, at least locally be fulfilled by a
suitable choice of the initial surface in a given spacetime. Remarkably, they
are also (formally) identical to ones employed earlier by Hayward in order to
define a 2+1 foliation on null surfaces, with respect to which the Hawking mass
is again monotonic.

flat direction to all orders in perturbation theory. We consider possible
perturbative corrections to the Kahler potential in inverse powers of $Re S$

  characteristic","16 pages, Example 1.3 added, minor modifications, to appear in IMRN",,,,"math.NT math.AG",,"  The weight-monodromy conjecture claims the coincidence of the weight
filtration and the monodromy filtration, up to shift, on the $l$-adic \'etale
cohomology of a proper smooth variety over a complete discrete valuation field.
Although it has been proved in some cases, the case of dimension $\geq 3$ in
mixed characteristic is still open so far. The aim of this paper is to give a
proof of the weight-monodromy conjecture for a threefold which has a projective
strictly semistable model such that, for each irreducible component of the
special fiber, the Picard number is equal to the second $l$-adic Betti number.
Our proof is based on a careful analysis of the weight spectral sequence of
Rapoport-Zink by the Hodge index theorem for surfaces. We also prove a $p$-adic
analogue by using the weight spectral sequence of Mokrane.
