resolve the fragmentation process down to the opacity limit. The simulation
follows the collapse and fragmentation of a large-scale turbulent molecular
cloud to form a stellar cluster and, simultaneously, the formation of
circumstellar discs and binary stars. This large range of scales enables us to
predict a wide variety of stellar properties for comparison with observations.
The calculation clearly demonstrates that star formation is a highly-dynamic
and chaotic process. Star-disc encounters form binaries and truncate discs.
Stellar encounters disrupt bound multiple systems. The cloud produces roughly
equal numbers of stars and brown dwarfs, with masses down to the opacity limit
for fragmentation (~5 Jupiter masses). The initial mass function is consistent
with a Salpeter slope (Gamma=-1.35) above 0.5 Msun, a roughly flat distribution
(Gamma=0) in the range 0.006-0.5 Msun, and a sharp cutoff below ~0.005 Msun.
This is consistent with recent observational surveys. The brown dwarfs form by
the dynamical ejection of low-mass fragments from dynamically unstable multiple
systems before the fragments have been able to accrete to stellar masses. Close
binary systems (with separations <10 AU) are not formed by fragmentation in
situ. Rather, they are produced by hardening of initially wider multiple
systems through a combination of dynamical encounters, gas accretion, and/or
the interaction with circumbinary and circumtriple discs. Finally, we find that
the majority of circumstellar discs have radii less than 20 AU due to
truncation in dynamical encounters. This is consistent with observations of the
Orion Trapezium Cluster and implies that most stars and brown dwarfs do not
form large planetary systems.

the weak transition. The stimulated emission opens a fast decay channel leading
to a fast radiative cycle in the atom (or ion). We apply this model by
explaining two unusually bright Fe II lines at 250.7 and 250.9 nm in the UV

exhibit circular polarisation (CP) with surprising temporal persistent
handedness. As a possible explanation we propose that the CP is due to Faraday
conversion (FC) of linear polarisation (LP) synchrotron light which propagates
along a line-of-sight (LOS) through twisted magnetic fields. The rotational
nature of accretion flows onto black holes naturally generates the required
magnetic twist in the emission region, independent of whether it is a jet or an
ADAF. The expected twist in both types of flows is of the order of what is
required for optimal CP generation. This scenario requires that Faraday
rotation (FR) is insignificant in the emission region. Although this is an
assumption, it relaxes constraints on the plasma parameters, that were given in
scenarios which rely on FR, since there the strength of FR can not be too far
from the optimum. The proposed mechanism works in electron-positron (e+-) as
well as electron-proton (e/p) plasma. In the latter case, the emission region
should consist of individual flux tubes with independent polarities in order to
suppress too strong FR. The predominant CP is expected to mostly counter-rotate
(rotation is measured here in sky-projection) with respect to the central
engine in all cases (jet or ADAF, e+- or e/p plasma). If the proposed mechanism
is indeed operating, it will allow to measure the sense of rotation of quasar
engines. The engine of SgrA* is then expected to rotate clockwise and therefore
counter-Galactic, as do the young hot stars in its vicinity, which are thought
to feed SgrA* by their winds. Similarly, we expect the microquasars SS 443 and
GRS 1915+105 to rotate clockwise. Generally, sources with Stokes-V<0 (V>0) are
expected to rotate clockwise (counter-clockwise) in this scenario.

considerable spectral complexity is apparent (e.g., reflection, partial
covering) and must be taken into account to model the data accurately.
Moreover, the choice of spectral model (i.e., free vs. fixed photon index) has
a pronounced effect on the derived N_H distribution and, to a lesser extent,
the X-ray luminosity distribution. Ten of the 136 AGN (~7%) show significant Fe
Kalpha emission-line features with equivalent widths in the range 0.1-1.3 keV.

spirals, in contrast, show a strong tendency to avoid galaxies with large-scale
bars. Comparison of the AGN and inactive samples shows that nuclear dust
spirals, which may trace shocks and angular momentum dissipation in the ISM,
occur with comparable frequency in both active and inactive galaxies. The only
difference between the active and inactive galaxies is that several inactive

nuclear spirals in active and inactive galaxies, combined with previous work
that finds no significant differences in the frequency of bars or interactions
between well-matched active and inactive galaxies, suggests that no universal
fueling mechanism for low-luminosity AGN operates at spatial scales greater
than ~100 pc radius from the galactic nuclei. The similarities instead suggest
that the lifetime of nuclear activity is less than the characteristic inflow

compare simulation results with the observational data directly and

simpler chemo-dynamical evolution code. We newly find that radiative cooling
becomes more efficient and thus the gas infall rate increases, with decreasing
mass of galaxies, which contributes to the slope of the CMR. In addition, the
sophisticated treatments of both SNe II and SNe Ia in GCD+ show that feedback
from SNe Ia plays a crucial role in the evolution of elliptical galaxies. We
conclude that the feedback effect of SNe Ia should not be ignored in studying
the evolution of elliptical galaxies.

to demonstrate that close binary stellar systems (separations $\lsim 10$ AU)
need not be formed directly by fragmentation. Instead, a high frequency of
close binaries can be produced through a combination of dynamical interactions
in unstable multiple systems and the orbital decay of initially wider binaries.
Orbital decay may occur due to gas accretion and/or the interaction of a binary
with its circumbinary disc. These three mechanisms avoid the problems
associated with the fragmentation of optically-thick gas to form close systems
directly. They also result in a preference for close binaries to have roughly
equal-mass components because dynamical exchange interactions and the accretion
of gas with high specific angular momentum drive mass ratios towards unity.
Furthermore, due to the importance of dynamical interactions, we find that
stars with greater masses ought to have a higher frequency of close companions,
and that many close binaries ought to have wide companions. These properties
are in good agreement with the results of observational surveys.

of FeI and FeII, we remark that this gravity also satisfies the MgI/MgII,
TiI/TiII and MnI/MnII equilibria, within errors. The abundance analysis
indicates a metallicity, [Fe/H] = --2.7. A large overabundance of carbon

elements and in particular lead shows an extremely high abundance of
[Pb/Fe]=3.5, which makes this the star with the highest Pb/Fe ratio, up to

in systems with trivial static correlations. As an example we have chosen N
infinitely thin hard rods with length L, fixed with their centers on a periodic
lattice with lattice constant a. Starting from the N-rod Smoluchowski equation
we derive a coupled set of equations for fluctuations of reduced k-rod
densities. We approximate the influence of the surrounding rods onto the
dynamics of a pair of rods by introduction of an effective rotational diffusion
tensor D and in this way we obtain a self-consistent equation for D. This
equation exhibits a feedback mechanism leading to a slowing down of the
relaxation. It involves as an input the Laplace transform v_0(l/r) at z=0,
l=L/a, of a torque-torque correlator of an isolated pair of rods with distance
R=ar. Our equation predicts the existence of a continuous ergodicity-breaking
transition at a critical length l_c=L_c/a. To estimate the critical length we
perform an approximate analytical calculation of v_0(l/r) based on a
variational approach and obtain l_c^{var}=5.68, 4.84 and 3.96 for an sc, bcc
and fcc lattice. We also evaluate v_0(l/r) numerically exactly from a two-rod
simulation. The latter calculation leads to l_c^{num}=3.45, 2.78 and 2.20 for
the corresponding lattices. Close to l_c the rotational diffusion constant
decreases as D(l) ~ (l_c - l)^\gamma with \gamma=1 and a diverging time scale
t_\epsilon ~ |l_c - l|^{-\delta}, \delta=2, appears. On this time scale the t-
and l-dependence of the 1-rod density is determined by a master function
depending only on t/t_\epsilon. In contrast to present microscopic theories our
approach predicts a glass transition despite the absence of any static
correlations.

ground state that is separated from the excited states by a gap. The magnitude
of the gap is evaluated. The results are consistent with the recently observed
half-polarized states in the FQHE at a fixed filling factor. It is suggested
that similar anomalies exist for other spin configurations in degenerate

half filling of Landau levels and the interaction is incorporated into an

new interactions between the Composite Fermions. The effective interaction is

investigated by means of kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the three
dimensional slithering snake version of the bond-fluctuation model.
  Surprisingly, the slithering snake dynamics becomes inconsistent with
classical reptation predictions at high chain overlap (either chain length $N$
or volume fraction $\phi$) where the relaxation times increase much faster than
expected.
  This is due to the anomalous curvilinear diffusion in a finite time window
whose upper bound $\tau_+$ is set by the chain end density $\phi/N$. Density
fluctuations created by passing chain ends allow a reference polymer to break
out of the local cage of immobile obstacles created by neighboring chains.
  The dynamics of dense solutions of snakes at $t \ll \tau_+$ is identical to
that of a benchmark system where all but one chain are frozen. We demonstrate
that it is the slow creeping of a chain out of its correlation hole which
causes the subdiffusive dynamical regime.
  Our results are in good qualitative agreement with the activated reptation
scheme proposed recently by Semenov and Rubinstein [Eur. Phys. J. B, {\bf 1}
(1998) 87].
  Additionally, we briefly comment on the relevance of local relaxation
pathways within a slithering snake scheme. Our preliminary results suggest that
a judicious choice of the ratio of local to slithering snake moves is crucial
to equilibrate a melt of long chains efficiently.

in spacetime, temperature is the ratio between flow parameter and proper time.
An eternal accelerated Unruh observer has access to the local algebra
associated to a Rindler wedge. The flow defined by the Minkowski vacuum of a
field theory over this algebra is proportional to a flow in spacetime and the
associated temperature is the Unruh temperature. An observer with a finite
lifetime has access to the local observable algebra associated to a finite
spacetime region called a ""diamond"". The flow defined by the Minkowski vacuum
of a (four dimensional, conformally invariant) quantum field theory over this
algebra is also proportional to a flow in spacetime. The associated temperature
generalizes the Unruh temperature to finite lifetime observers.
  Furthermore, this temperature does not vanish even in the limit in which the
acceleration is zero. The temperature associated to an inertial observer with
lifetime T, which we denote as ""diamond's temperature"", is 2hbar/(pi k_b
T).This temperature is related to the fact that a finite lifetime observer does
not have access to all the degrees of freedom of the quantum field theory.

the energy density, the general solution of the field equations can be obtained
in an exact parametric form. The obtained solutions describe generally a
non-inflationary brane world. In the large time limit the brane Universe
isotropizes, ending in an isotropic and homogeneous state. The evolution of the

compactification of heterotic string with two Wilson lines, where three
families of particles of $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$, including
Higgses, are automatically present. In orbifold models, Yukawa couplings can be
calculated explicitly, and it is known that they get exponential supression
factors depending on the distance between the fixed points to which the fields
are attached. We find that in the $Z_3$ case, the quark and charged-lepton mass
hierarchies can easily be obtained for reasonable values of the three moduli
determining the radii of the compactified space, $T_i\sim 1$. For the
neutrinos, due to the smallness of their Dirac masses, the required scale for
the see-saw mechanism to give the correct masses is found to be within reach of
the electroweak scale. Finally, we find that one of the small number of
possibilities for quark and lepton mass matrices yields consistent results for
the mixing angles and the weak CP violation phase. Although our scheme relies
on the mixing between fields due to Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, it is
considerably more predictive than alternative models of flavour.

naturally in the study of flow equivalence for topological Markov chains.
  We prove that out-splittings give rise to isomorphic graph algebras, and
in-splittings give rise to strongly Morita equivalent $C^*$-algebras. We
generalise the notion of a delay as defined by Drinen to form in-delays and
out-delays. We prove that these constructions give rise to Morita equivalent

For values of the nonlinear parameter such that the uncoupled maps are chaotic,
time-delayed mutual coupling suppress the chaotic behavior by stabilizing a

reaction-diffusion systems where anomalous diffusion is due to the presence of
asymmetric Levy flights. Our approach consists of replacing the Laplacian
diffusion operator by a fractional diffusion operator, whose fundamental
solutions are Levy $\alpha$-stable distributions. Numerical simulation of the
fractional Fisher-Kolmogorov equation, and analytical arguments show that
anomalous diffusion leads to the exponential acceleration of fronts and a
universal power law decay, $x^{-\alpha}$, of the tail, where $\alpha$, the
index of the Levy distribution, is the order of the fractional derivative.

investigated at thermal equilibrium using a variety of theoretical and
numerical tools. The influence of temperature on the absorption spectra is
estimated using the quantum superposition method for a variety of cluster sizes
in the range 6<=n<=146. At the harmonic level of approximation, the absorption
intensity is calculated through an extension of the Gaussian theory by Wadi and
Pollak [J. Chem. Phys. vol 110, 11890 (1999)]. This theory is tested on simple,
few-atom systems in both the classical and quantum regimes for which highly
accurate Monte Carlo data can be obtained. By incorporating quantum anharmonic
corrections to the partition functions and respective weights of the isomers,
we show that the superposition method can correctly describe the
finite-temperature spectroscopic properties of CaAr_n systems. The use of the
absorption spectrum as a possible probe of isomerization or phase changes in
the argon cluster is discussed at the light of finite-size effects.

CaAr_6 and CaAr_10 simple relaxation is observed with a single time scale.
CaAr_13 exhibits much slower dynamics and the relaxation occurs over two
distinct time scales. CaAr_37 shows much slower relaxation with multiple
transients, reminiscent of glassy behavior due to competition between different
low-energy structures. We interpret these results in terms of the underlying
potential energy surfaces for these clusters.

terms of an effective diatomics molecule Ca-(Ar_n), in the framework of
semiclassical vertical transitions. We show how, upon choosing a suitable
reaction coordinate, the effective finite-temperature equilibrium properties
can be obtained for the ground- and excited-surfaces from the potential of mean
force (PMF). An extension of the recent multiple range random-walk method is
used to calculate the PMF over continuous intervals of distances. The
absorption spectra calculated using this single-coordinate description are
found to be in good agreement with the spectra obtained from high-statistics
Monte Carlo data, in various situations. For CaAr$_{13}$, we compare the
performances of two different choices of the reaction coordinate. For CaAr_37,
the method is seen to be accurate enough to distinguish between different
low-energy structures. Finally, the idea of casting the initial many-body
problem into a single degree of freedom problem is tested on the spectroscopy
of calcium in bulk solid argon.

systems. Typically, this happens gradually and asymptotically after a certain
characteristic decoherence time. For the Wigner-function, however, one can
prove that it evolves perfectly into a classical (non-negative) phase space
distribution after a finite time of decoherence.
