number of low-luminosity `starburst' radio-selected galaxies (SBRG) found by
Owen et. al. 1999 in Abell 2125 is not indicative of other rich clusters in our
sample. The average fraction of SBRG is <f(SBRG)> = 0.022+/-0.003. The A2125
fraction is f(SBRG) = 0.09+/-10.03 which is significantly different from the

x-ray brightness distribution and optical adaptively smoothed images of A1278

SBRG population. There is a significant spatial distribution difference between
the low and high-luminosity (HLRG) radio-selected populations. The HLRGs seem
to be a subclass of the cluster's massive red elliptical population, while the
SBRGs have a projected radial distribution more like the blue spiral
population. Our results indicate that most of the SBRGs are probably gas-rich

radiatively driven disk outflows in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) consisting of
a continuous wind with embedded clouds. The continuous outflow is launched from
the disk surface as a centrifugally driven wind, whereas the clouds are
uplifted from the disk by the ram pressure of the continuous outflow. In
addition, the continuous wind and clouds are subject to both line and continuum
radiative acceleration. We describe this model in detail, outline the tests
used to verify its accuracy, and compare it to other outflow models, showing
possible difficulties with some past line-driven models. We then perform a
comprehensive parameter study to explore the dependence of the continuous wind
on the relevant physical parameters. We find that clouds have a significant
impact on the geometry, density, and velocity in the continuous wind, changing
the terminal velocity by up to 50%. Furthermore, line driving is the dominant
acceleration mechanism for clouds; continuum driving can also become important
for dusty clouds. We find that radiative acceleration can have a significant
impact on the velocities in the continuous wind and note that the radiative
acceleration comes largely from continuum opacities, not from line driving as
in some previous models. When the continuous winds are dusty, their terminal
velocities change by approximately 20% to 30% (depending on the type of dust).

X-ray binaries (LMXBs) within a sample of 15 nearby early-type galaxies

given galaxy is remarkably similar from galaxy to galaxy when only sources with
X-ray luminosities less than 10^39 ergs/s (0.3-10 keV) are considered. Fitting
these lower luminosity sources in all galaxies simultaneously yielded a
best-fit power law exponent of Gamma = 1.56 +/- 0.02 (or kT_brem = 7.3 +/- 0.3
keV). This is the tightest constraint to date on the spectral properties of
LMXBs in external galaxies. There is no apparent difference in the spectral
properties of LMXBs that reside inside and outside globular clusters. We
demonstrate how the uniformity of the spectral properties of LMXBs can lead to
more accurate determinations of the temperature and metallicity of the hot gas
in galaxies. Although few in number in any given galaxy, sources with
luminosities of 1-2 x 10^39 ergs/s are present in 10 of the galaxies. The
spectra of these luminous sources are softer than the spectra of the rest of
the sources, and are consistent with the spectra of Galactic black hole X-ray
binary candidates when they are in their very high state. The spectra of these
sources are very different than those of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs)
found within spiral galaxies, suggesting that the two populations of X-ray
luminous objects have different formation mechanisms. The number of sources
with apparent luminosities above 2 x 10^39 ergs/s is equal to the number of
expected background AGN and thus appear to not be associated with the galaxy,
indicating that very luminous sources are absent or very rare in early-type
galaxies. (Abridged)

blue colors, and compare them to 80 field galaxies with similar colors and
luminosities. Our previous work (McIntosh et al. 2004, ApJ submitted) shows
that the blue galaxies in these local clusters are a recently infalling
population that has yet to encounter the dense core. We quantify galaxy
internal structure from 2D B/D decompositions using GIM2D. We observe
structural differences between blue galaxies in clusters, compared to the
field. Most blue cluster members are physically smaller and fainter than their
field counterparts. At a matched size and luminosity, recent arrivals are
smoother in appearance, yet their total light is as disk-dominated as in normal
field spirals. Moreover, 50% of blue cluster galaxies have blue cores or
globally blue color profiles, in contrast with field spirals that have
typically red color gradients. Without environment dependent evolution outside
of cluster cores, we expect blue disk galaxies in clusters and the field to
have similar morphologies, sizes, and color gradients. We show conclusively
that galaxy properties do reflect the environment in which the galaxy is found.
The data show that the transformation of accreted galaxies is not confined to
the dense cluster core. The overall properties of bluer cluster galaxies are
best explained by environment-driven transformation of accreted field spirals,
and our results suggest that the processes that govern color and morphological

recombination line emission for a wide range of physical conditions. The VLBA
has been used to search for the H65$\alpha$ hydrogen recombination line. The
line is only expected to be seen against the northern feature which contains a
small fraction of the total radio flux density. This spatial discrimination
significantly aids the search for a weak line. No line was seen, with upper
limits of roughly 15% of the continuum over a velocity range of 1486 km/s with
resolutions up to 6.6 km/s. In the absence of a strong radiation field, this
would imply that the free-free absorbing gas has a wide velocity width, is
moving rapidly relative to the systemic velocity, or is concentrated in a thin,
high density structure. All of these possibilities are reasonably likely close
to an AGN. However, in the intense radiation environment of the AGN, even
considering only the radiation we actually observe passing through the

well-known subgroup connected to NGC4839 in the South-West of the cluster, and
another substructure located between NGC 4839 and the centre of the Coma

temperature map we see that in front of this new structure the temperature is
significantly increased (higher or equal 10 keV). We interpret this temperature
enhancement as the result of heating as this structure falls onto the Coma
cluster. We furthermore reconfirm the filament-like structure South-East of the
cluster centre. This region is significantly cooler than the mean cluster
temperature. We estimate the temperature of this structure to be equal or below
1keV. A possible scenario to explain the observed features is stripping caused
by the infall of a small group of galaxies located around the two galaxies
NGC4921 and NGC4911 into the Coma cluster with a non-zero impact parameter. We
also see significant X-ray depressions North and South-East of NGC4921, which
might either be linked to tidal forces due to the merger with the Western

The complex phase diagrams of these materials, with a variety of
spin-charge-orbital ordering tendencies, is addressed using mean-field and
Monte Carlo simulation techniques. The stability of the charge-ordered states,
such as the CE-state at half-doping, appears to originate, in part, in the
topology of the zigzag chains present in those states. In addition, it is
argued that phase separation tendencies are notorious in realistic models for
Mn-oxides. They produce nanoscale clusters of competing phases, either through
an electronic separation tendency or through the influence of disorder on
first-order transitions. These inhomogeneities lead to a ``colossal''
magnetoresistance (CMR) effect, compatible with experiments. This brief review
is based on a more extensive work recently presented [E. Dagotto, T. Hotta, and
A. Moreo, Phys. Rep. {\bf 344}, 1 (2001)]. There, a comprehensive analysis of
the experimental literature can be found. In real manganites, the tendencies
toward inhomogeneous states are notorious in CMR regimes, in excellent
agreement with the theoretical description outlined here.

important consequence of the strong suppression of the one-triplet process due

below the energy gap of the one-triplet state, indicating the proximity to a

eight sharp and discrete levels, which indicates the contribution of distant

first-class generic functions that can traverse terms of any type while mixing

combinators. This is done without commitment to a specific functional language.
We analyse the design space for implementational models of functional

electromagnetic form factor: the anapole moment, that in the static limit
corresponds to the axial vector charge radius <r^2_A>. As is the case for the

physical quantity is non trivial. I will first describe briefly the origin of
the long standing controversy about the physical or non physical nature of the

electromagnetic form factors, for Majorana neutrinos cosmological and
astrophysical arguments do not provide useful informations on <r^2_A>, and
therefore this quantity has to be studied by means of terrestrial experiment.
Finally, I will discuss the constraints that can be derived on <r^2_A> for the
tau neutrino from a comprehensive analysis of the data on single photon
production off Z-resonance, and I will conclude with a few comments on

the absence of real mass poles simulates quark confinement. The analytic
continuation in the total momentum necessary to reach the mass shell for a
meson sufficiently heavier than 1 GeV leads to the quark poles being within the
integration domain for two variables in the standard approach. Through Feynman
integral techniques, we show how the analytic continuation can be implemented
in a way suitable for a practical numerical solution. We show that the would-be
qbar-q width to the meson generated from one quark pole is exactly cancelled by
the effect of the conjugate partner pole; the meson mass remains real and there
is no spurious qbar-q production threshold. The ladder kernel we employ is
consistent with one-loop perturbative QCD and has a two-parameter infrared

Since states of quantum spacetime are so far not observed directly, they ought
to be projected out from the overall Hilbert space (much like states of a
quantum medium in the optical model often constructed in nuclear physics).
Then, in the reduced Hilbert space only states of quantum matter and energy are
left, but now endowed with the energy width that enters through an
antiHermitian interaction-like operator, a remainder of their coupling to the
quantum spacetime. We postulate that such an energy width involves an averaged
coupling of quantum matter and energy to a classical field of time deviations
from the uniform time run (in the classical spacetime of special relativity).
The well known time-temperature analogy helps us to fix other postulates

understand central geometric objects like metric, torsion and curvature as
``tensors'' with (left) covariance properties. This ensures that tensor
components (with respect to a basis of the space of 1-forms) transform in the
familiar homogeneous way under a change of basis. There is a natural
compatibility condition for a metric and a linear connection. The resulting
(pseudo-) Riemannian geometry is explored in this work. It is demonstrated that
the components of the metric are indeed able to properly describe properties of
discrete geometries like lengths and angles. A simple geometric understanding
in particular of torsion and curvature is achieved. The formalism has much in
common with lattice gauge theory. For example, the Riemannian curvature is
determined by parallel transport of vectors around a plaquette (which
corresponds to a biangle, a triangle or a quadrangle).

extension of Voiculescu's random matrix result: Let X_1^(n),...,X_r^(n) be a
system of r stochastically independent n by n Gaussian self-adjoint random
matrices as in Voiculescu's random matrix paper [V4], and let (x_1,...,x_r) be

||p(x_1,...,x_r)||, for almost all omega in the underlying probability space.

to unitary evolution and a proper normalisation condition are introduced. Some
particular instances are analysed and parallel transport leading to the
off-diagonal mixed state geometric phase is delineated. A complete experimental
realisation of the off-diagonal mixed state geometric phases in the qubit case
using polarisation-entangled two-photon interferometry is proposed.

  (TH-2002), Paris, UNESCO, 22-27 July 2002",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The restricted-path-integral (RPI) theory of continuous quantum measurements
including the evolution of the measured systems and phenomenon of decoherence
is reviewed. The measured system is considered as an open quantum system but
without usage of any model of the measurement (of the measuring medium or the
system's environment). The propagator of a measured system (conditioned by the
measurement readout) is presented by RPI. In the important special case of
monitoring an observable the propagator and the system's wave function satisfy
Schroedinger equation with a complex Hamiltonian (depending on the measurement
readout). Going over to the non-selective description of the measurement leads
to the Lindblad master equation. In case of non-minimally disturbing
measurements this gives theory of dissipative systems avoiding difficulties of
other approaches. The whole theory is deduced from first principles of quantum
mechanics. This proves that quantum mechanics includes theory of measurements
and is therefore conceptually closed.

$\vec S_{1}$, $\vec S_{2}$ using the Peres-Horodecki criterion. Such density
matrices arise from thermal equilibrium states of isotropic spin systems. The
partial transpose of such a state has the same multiplet structure and
degeneracies as the original matrix with eigenvalue of largest multiplicity
being non-negative. The case $S_{1}=S$, $S_{2}=1/2$ can be solved completely
and is discussed in detail with respect to isotropic Heisenberg spin models.
Moreover, in this case the Peres-Horodecki ciriterion turns out to be a
sufficient condition for non-separability. We also characterize SU(2)-invariant
states of two spins of length 1.
