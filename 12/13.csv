the corresponding dark matter. The mass of the dark particles is of the order
of the condensation scale $\Lambda_c$ and the temperature is smaller then the

feedback can limit the mass of a forming star. For this we must understand the
rate at which primordial protostars accrete, how they and their feedback output
evolve, and how this feedback interacts with the infalling matter. We describe
the accretion rate with an ``isentropic accretion'' model: the rate is
initially very large (~0.03 M_sun/yr when m_* =1 M_sun) and declines as
m_*^{-3/7}. Protostellar evolution is treated with a model that tracks the
total energy of the star. A key difference compared to previous studies is
allowance for rotation of the infalling envelope. This leads to photospheric
conditions at the star and dramatic differences in the feedback. Two feedback
mechanisms are considered: HII region breakout and radiation pressure from
Lyman-alpha and FUV photons. Radiation pressure appears to be the dominant
mechanism for suppressing infall, becoming dynamically important around 20
M_sun.

thought to be the main source of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) characteristics
(luminosities of $L \approx 10^{12} L_{\odot}$). The release of gravitational
binding energy by the accretion of material on to an SMO in the range of $10^7
- 10^9 M_{\odot}$ has been suggested to be the primary powerhouse (Lynden-Bell
1969).
  That rather exotic idea in early time has become common sense nowadays. Not
only our own galaxy harbours a few million-solar mass black hole (Genzel 2001)
but also many of other non-active galaxies show kinematic and gas-dynamic
evidence of these objects (Magorrian et al. 1998) The concept of central
super-massive stars (SMSs henceforth) (${\cal M} \ge 5 \times 10^4 M_{\odot}$,
where ${\cal M}$ is the mass of the SMS) embedded in dense stellar systems was
suggested as a possible explanation for high- energy emissions phenomena
occurring in AGNs and quasars (Vilkoviski 1976, Hara 1978), such as X-ray
emissions (Bahcall and Ostriker, 1975). SMSs and super-massive black holes
(SMBHs) are two possibilities to explain the nature of SMOs, and SMSs may be an
intermediate step towards the formation of SMBHs (Rees 1984). In this paper we
give the equations that describe the dynamics of such a dense star-gas system
which are the basis for the code that will be used in a prochain future to
simulate this scenario. We also briefly draw the mathematical fundamentals of

Newtonian dynamics (MOND). I show that self-gravitating isothermal gas spheres
are not good representations of rich clusters with respect to the radial gas
density distribution as indicated by the X-ray surface brightness. Pure gas
spheres with a density distribution described by a ``beta'' model, as observed,
also fail because, with MOND, these objects are far from isothermal. These
problems may be resolved by adding an additional dark mass component in the
central regions; a constant density sphere contained within two core radii and
having a total mass of one to two times that in the gas. With this additional
component, the observed luminosity-temperature relation for clusters of
galaxies is reproduced. When the observed X-ray surface brightness distribution
in actual clusters is modeled by such a two-component structure, the typical
mass discrepancy is three to four times smaller than with Newtonian dynamics.
Thus while MOND significantly reduces the mass of the dark component in
clusters it does not remove it completely. I speculate on the nature of the
dark component and argue that this is not a fundamental problem for MOND.

the distribution of galaxy sizes as well as the distribution in the plane of

galaxy evolution is, it does not affect significantly the properties of bright
galaxies in the log(r_e) -- mi_e, plane at least since z=0.64. The evolution of
the zeropoint of the Kormendy relation is fully explained by the cosmological
dimming in an expanding universe plus the passive luminosity evolution of

a black hole formed in hypernovae and black hole-neutron star coalescence. The
torus is ab initio uniformly magnetized, represented by two counter oriented
current-rings, and develops a state of suspended accretion against a ""magnetic
wall"" around the black hole. Magnetic stability of the torus gives rise to a
new fundamental limit EB/Ek<0.1 for the ratio of poloidal magnetic field
energy-to-kinetic energy. The lifetime of rapid spin of the black hole is
effectively defined by the timescale of dissipation of black hole-spin energy
in the horizon, and satisfies T= 40s (MH/7MSun)(R/6MH)^4(0.03MH/MT) for a black
hole of mass MH surrounded by a torus of mass MT and radius R. The torus
converts a major fraction Egw/Erot=0.1 into gravitational radiation through a
finite number of multipole mass-moments, and a smaller fraction into MeV
neutrinos and baryon-rich winds. At a source distance of 100Mpc, these
emissions over N=2e4 periods give rise to a characteristic strain amplitude
\sqrt{N}hchar=6e-21. We argue that torus winds create an open magnetic
flux-tube on the black hole, which carries a minor and standard fraction
Ej/Erot=1e-3 in baryon-poor outflows to infinity. We identify this baryon poor
output of tens of seconds with GRBs with contemporaneous and strongly
correlated emissions in gravitational radiation, conceivably at multiple
frequencies. Ultimately, this leaves a black hole binary surrounded by a
supernova remnant.

absorption in GRBs without optical transient (dark GRBs) compared to GRBs with
optical transient (OTGRBs). Rather, we find that the 1.6-10 keV flux of OTGRBs
is on average about 5 times larger than that of the dark GRBs. A K-S test shows
that this difference is significant at 99.8% probability. Under the assumption
that dark and OTGRB have similar spectra, this could suggest that the first are
uncaught in the optical band because they are just faint sources. In order to
test this hypothesis, we have determined the optical-to-X ray flux ratios of
the sample. OTGRBs show a remarkably narrow distribution of flux ratios, which
corresponds to an average optical-to-x spectral index 0.794\pm 0.054. We find
that, while 75% of dark GRBs have flux ratio upper limits still consistent with
those of OT GRBs, the remaining 25% are 4 - 10 times weaker in optical than in
X-rays. The significance of this result is equal to or higher than 2.6 sigma.
If this sub-population of dark GRBs were constituted by objects assimilable to
OTGRBs, they should have shown optical fluxes higher than upper limits actually
found. We discuss the possible causes of their behaviour, including a possible
occurrence in high density clouds or origin at very high redshift and a
connection with ancient, Population III stars.

delta-m1 and delta-hk, both identify this cluster as the most metal-rich object
studied on either system to date. Simple extrapolation of the available
metallicity calibrations leads to [Fe/H] ranging from +0.7 to +0.9. Metal-rich
isochrones with overshoot imply an age between 2.5 and 3.5 Gyr, with an
apparent distance modulus between (m-M)= 11.6 and 12.2, depending upon the
isochrones used. The improvement in the fit using alpha-enhanced isochrones may
indicate that the cluster [Fe/H] is closer to +0.4, but the photometric indices
are distorted by an elemental distribution other than a scaled solar. The
galacto- centric position of the cluster, in conjunction with data for other
clusters and Cepheids, is consistent with the inner disk reaching and
maintaining a metallicity well above solar since the early history of the disk,

possible explanation for the nonthermal flux; however, additional evidence of
diffuse, nonthermal emission comes from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and the
Westerbork Northern Sky Survey radio measurements, in which excess diffuse,
radio flux is observed after point-source subtraction. The radio excess can be
fitted to a simple power law with a spectral index of ~1.8, which is consistent

entropy gas have been proposed to explain the deviation from self-similarity in
the cluster L_x-T_x relation and the observed entropy floor in these systems.
However, severe overcooling of gas in groups is necessary for radiative cooling
alone to explain the observations. Non-gravitational entropy injection must
therefore still be important in these systems. We point out that on scales of
groups and below, gas heated to the required entropy floor cannot cool in a
Hubble time, regardless of its subsequent adiabatic compression. Preheating
therefore shuts off the gas supply to galaxies, and should be an important
global feedback mechanism for galaxy formation. Constraints on global gas
cooling can be placed from the joint evolution of the comoving star formation
rate and neutral gas density. Preheating at high redshift can be ruled out;
however the data does not rule out passive gas consumption without inflow since
z~2. Since for preheated gas t_cool > t_dyn, we speculate that preheating could
play a role in determining the Hubble sequence: at a given mass scale, high
sigma peaks in the density field collapse early to form ellipticals, while low
sigma peaks collapse late and quiescently accrete preheated gas to form
spirals. The entropy produced by large scale shock-heating of the intergalatic
medium is significant only at late times, z<1, and cannot produce these
effects.

In this paper we calculate the lensing probability produced by such a compound

that the mass function of halos is given by the Press-Schechter function and
the Universe is described by an LCDM, OCDM, or SCDM model. The LCDM model is
normalized to the WMAP observations, OCDM and SCDM models are normalized to the

model is ruled out. The fit of the compound model to the observed correlation
between splitting angle and time delay is excellent but the fit to the number
vs splitting angle relation is only adequate using the small number of sources

great power in discriminating among cosmological models. Furthermore,
population C in an LCDM model has a unique signature in the time domain, an

distinguishable from variants of CDM scenarios, such as warm dark matter,

crucial for linking the stellar progenitors to the final remnants and for
predicting observable properties like explosion energies, neutron star and

kicks. Here we review different suggestions for the explosion mechanism and
discuss the constraints that can or cannot be deduced from observations. The
most refined and detailed hydrodynamical models are available for
neutrino-driven supernova explosions, although the viability of this mechanism
has yet to be demonstrated convincingly. Since spherical models do not explode,
the hope rests on the helpful effects of convection inside the nascent neutron
star and in the neutrino-heated region behind the stalled shock. We present the
first two-dimensional simulations of these processes which have been performed
with a Boltzmann solver for the neutrino transport and a state-of-the-art
description of neutrino-matter interactions. Our most complete models fail, but
convection brings them encouragingly close to a success. An explosion could be
obtained by just a minor modification of the neutrino transport, in which case
the exploding model fulfills important requirements from observations

Detailed observations of large scale radio emission and upper limits for hard,
non-thermal X-ray emission in the $2 - 10$ keV energy band have been also
reported. Here we show that all available observations can be accounted for by
the existence of two electron Populations (indicated as I and II) in the M87
Galaxy. The mildly relativistic Population I is responsible for the EUV excess
emission via IC scattering of CBR and starlight photons. Population II
electrons (with higher energy) are instead responsible for the radio emission
through synchrotron mechanism. The same electrons also give rise to hard
non-thermal X-ray emission (via IC scattering of CBR photons), but the
resulting power is always below the upper bounds placed by present
observations. The non-negligible energy budget of the two electron populations
with respect to that associated with thermal electrons indicates that the M87
galaxy is not today in a quiescent (relaxed) phase. Nuclear activity and
merging processes could have made available this energy budget that today is
released in the form of relativistic electrons.

massive stars demands theoretical explanations. Central of these is a
self-consistent model for the physical mechanism that provides the energy to
start and drive the disruption of the star. We give arguments why the delayed
neutrino-heating mechanism should still be regarded as the standard paradigm to
explain most explosions of massive stars and show how large-scale and even
global asymmetries can result as a natural consequence of convective overturn
in the neutrino-heating region behind the supernova shock. Since the explosion
is a threshold phenomenon and depends sensitively on the efficiency of the
energy transfer by neutrinos, even relatively minor differences in numerical
simulations can matter on the secular timescale of the delayed mechanism. To
enhance this point, we present some results of recent one- and two-dimensional
computations, which we have performed with a Boltzmann solver for the neutrino
transport and a state-of-the-art description of neutrino-matter interactions.
Although our most complete models fail to explode, the simulations demonstrate
that one is encouragingly close to the critical threshold because a modest
variation of the neutrino transport in combination with postshock convection
leads to a weak neutrino-driven explosion with properties that fulfill
important requirements from observations.

detected so far. This, and other recent results, appear however to indicate
that nearby radio galaxies are more often gas rich than commonly assumed. The

Molecular abundances are consistent with a model of ice evaporation in an
envelope with gradients in temperature and density for a chemical age of ~30000
yr. The high observed abundance of OCS, the fact that T_ex (OCS) >> T_ex (H2S),
and the data on solid OCS and H2S all suggest that the major sulphur carrier in
grain mantles is OCS rather than H2S. For most other sulphur-bearing molecules,
the source-to-source abundance variations by factors of up to 10 do not
correlate with previously established evolutionary trends in temperature
tracers. These species probe the chemically inactive outer envelope. Our data
set does not constrain the abundances of H2S and SO in the inner envelope,
which, together with SO2, are required to use sulphur as a clock.

NCs are found to form either by nucleation, growth and Ostwald ripening at low
Si concentrations. Or at higher concentrations, non-spherical, elongated Si
structures form by spinodal decomposition, which spheroidize by interface
minimization during longer annealing. In both cases, the close SiO2/Si
interface is a strong sink for diffusing Si atoms. The NCs align above a thin
NC free oxide layer at the SiO2/Si interface. Hence, the width of this zone
denuded of NCs has just the right thickness for NC charging by direct electron
tunneling, which is crucial for non-volatile memory applications. Moreover, the
competition of Ostwald ripening and Si loss to the interface leads at low Si
concentrations (nucleation regime) to a constant width of the denuded zone and
a constant mean NC size over a long period of annealing.

distribution depends not only on the density, but also on the measurement cross
section: The most probable netto time gap in congested traffic flow upstream of
a bottleneck is significantly increased compared to uncongested freeway
sections. Moreover, we identify different power-law scaling laws for the
relative variance of netto time gaps as a function of the sampling size. While
the exponent is -1 in free traffic corresponding to statistically independent
time gaps, the exponent is about -2/3 in congested traffic flow because of

While earlier analyses (Du et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 2944 (1993)) assumed
constant broadening for each sample, our results for the disorder broadening
depend on the filling fraction, and appear to scale with the charge of the
elementary excitations of the corresponding fractional state. This result is
consistent with quasiparticle mediated dissipative transport.

destroys the sharp phase transition by rounding because a static order

temperatures the static order on the rare regions is destroyed. This restores
the phase transition and leads to a double-exponential relation between
critical temperature and coupling strength. We discuss the behavior based on
Lifshitz-tail arguments and illustrate the results by simulations of a model

reassessment of the structural symmetries found near the morphotropic phase
boundary in PZT, as well as in the PbTiO3 (PT) doped systems PZN-PT, and
PMN-PT. All three systems are now known to have nearly identical phase diagrams

controlled by the unique nature of the so-called polar nanoregions (PNR), which
first appear at the Burns temperature Td as evidenced by the onset of diffuse

  Learning in Context-Sensitive Domains, Bari, Italy, (1996), 53-59",,"NRC-39222","cs.LG cs.CV",,"  A large body of research in machine learning is concerned with supervised
learning from examples. The examples are typically represented as vectors in a
multi-dimensional feature space (also known as attribute-value descriptions). A
teacher partitions a set of training examples into a finite number of classes.
The task of the learning algorithm is to induce a concept from the training
examples. In this paper, we formally distinguish three types of features:
primary, contextual, and irrelevant features. We also formally define what it
means for one feature to be context-sensitive to another feature.
Context-sensitive features complicate the task of the learner and potentially
impair the learner's performance. Our formal definitions make it possible for a
learner to automatically identify context-sensitive features. After
context-sensitive features have been identified, there are several strategies
that the learner can employ for managing the features; however, a discussion of
these strategies is outside of the scope of this paper. The formal definitions
presented here correct a flaw in previously proposed definitions. We discuss
the relationship between our work and a formal definition of relevance.

fact that significant non-spherical electric(E2) and Coulomb quadrupole(C2)
amplitudes have been observed will be demonstrated. These multipoles for the
N,Delta system as a function of Q^2 from the photon point through 4 GeV^2 have
been measured with modest precision. Their precise magnitude remains model
dependent due to the contributions of the background amplitudes, although rapid
progress is being made to reduce these uncertainties. A discussion of what is
required to perform a model independent analysis is presented. All of the data
to date are consistent with a prolate shape for the proton (larger at the
poles) and an oblate shape(flatter at the poles) for the Delta. It is suggested
here that the fundamental reason for this lies in the spontaneous breaking of
chiral symmetry in QCD and the resulting, long range(low Q^2), effects of the
pion cloud. This verification of this suggestion, as well as a more accurate
measurement of the deviation from spherical symmetry, requires further
experimental and theoretical effort.

exhibiting a special class of solutions, with ``spontaneous symmetry breaking''

a different LT derivation and a new ""synchronized"" space time transformation
(ST). While he has shown that his results could be expressed in a Lorentz
invariant form, the simplest (but perhaps most shocking) approach appears to be
the use of the ST. The simplicity of this formulation, which bypasses the well
known paradoxes from Relativity, along with the fact that phenomena like time
dilatation are still predicted, suggests the need for further investigation on
this subject. We briefly discuss this new space time approach, using ST, and
suggest two new methods for measuring absolute velocities which also provide a
way to test Special Relativity.

atoms quantum reflecting from the nanoscopically disordered surface of a quartz
crystal. The use of the light, stable and inert He atom not only opens the
unique possibility of measuring quantum reflectivity in the thusfar
inaccessible limit of high energies, but also allows the determination of the
gas-solid interaction potential. The specularly reflected intensity from the
rough surface shows a change of 5 orders of magnitude within an incident
angular range of less than 6 degrees. By separating out the influence of
surface disorder the quantum reflection coefficient for the smooth surface is
deduced. Firstly, the data confirm the high energy asymptotic behavior of the
reflection, defined by the non-retarded attractive van der Waals potential. The
experiment shows very good agreement with our calculations covering the entire
energy region, in which also Casimir forces play a role. Parameters for the
gas-solid interaction perfectly match those reported in literature in the
vicinity of the potential minimum.

problem. If space is a physical entity through which quantum information (QI)
must be transported, then one can define its speed. If not, QI exists apart
from space, making space in some sense `nonphysical'. But we can still assign a
`speed' of QI to such models based on their properties. In both cases,
classical information must still travel at $c$, though in the latter case the
origin of local spacetime itself is a puzzle. We consider the properties of
different regimes for this speed of QI, and relevant quantum interpretations.
For example, we show that the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) is nonlocal
because it is what we call `spatially complete'.

of an optical lattice, and gate operations are mediated by excitation of

A potential source of decoherence in this system derives from motional heating,
which occurs if the ground and Rydberg states of the atom move in different
optical lattice potentials. We propose to minimize this effect by choosing the
lattice photon frequency \omega so that the ground and Rydberg states have the
same frequency-dependent polarizability \alpha(omega). The results are
presented for the case of Rb.
