clusters from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. The LF spans the range
$-22.5<M_{b_{\rm J}}<-15$, and is well-fitted by a Schechter function with
${M_{b_{\rm J}}}^{*}=-20.07\pm0.07$ and $\alpha=-1.28\pm0.03$ ($H_0$=100 km
s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_M$=0.3, $\Omega_\Lambda$=0.7). It differs
significantly from the field LF of \cite{mad02}, having a characteristic
magnitude that is approximately 0.3 mag brighter and a faint-end slope that is
approximately 0.1 steeper. There is no evidence for variations in the LF across
a wide range of cluster properties. However the LF of early-type galaxies in
clusters is both brighter and steeper than its field counterpart. The
differences between the field and cluster LFs for the various spectral types
can be qualitatively explained by the suppression of star formation in the
dense cluster environment, together with mergers to produce the brightest
early-type galaxies.

loss by supernovae in formation of two-component spherical galaxies composed of
baryon and dark matter. Three-dimensional deprojected de Vaucouleurs-like and
exponential-like profiles for baryon, embedded in truncated singular isothermal
and homogeneous profiles for dark matter, are considered. As a more realistic
case, we also consider a dark matter profile proposed by Navarro, Frenk &
  White. For simplicity we assume that dark matter distribution is not affected
by mass loss and that the change of baryonic matter distribution is homologous.
We found that the degree of the response depends on the fraction of dark matter
in the region where baryon is distributed, so that dwarf spheroidal galaxies
would be affected even in a dark halo if they are formed by galaxy mergers in
the envelope of the dark halo. Our results suggest that this scenario, combined
with dynamical response, would make not only the observed trends but the
dispersed characteristics of dwarf spheroidals.

proposed that jets are launched from a layer, governed by a highly diffusive,
super-Keplerian rotating and thermally dominated by virial-hot and magnetized
ion-plasma. The launching layer is located between the accretion disk and the
corona surrounding the nucleus. The matter in the layer is causally connected
to both the disk and to the central engine. Moreover we find that coronae, in
the absence of heating from below, are dynamically unstable to thermal
ion-conduction, and that accretion disks become intrinsically
advection-dominated. We confirm the capability of this multi-layer model to
form jets by carrying out 3D axisymmetric quasi-stationary MHD calculations
with high spatial resolution, and taking into account turbulent and magnetic
diffusion. The new multi-layer topology accommodates several previously
proposed elements for jet-initiation, in particular the ion-torus, the
magneto-centrifugal and the truncated disk - advective tori models.

0.03 Msun to 0.48 Msun and yields 40 brown dwarf candidates (BDCs) of which 29
are new. The spatial distribution of BDCs is fitted by a King profile in order
to estimate the cluster substellar core radius. The Pleiades mass function is
then derived accross the stellar-substellar boundary and we find that, between
0.03 Msun and 0.48 Msun, it is well represented by a single power-law, dN/dM
\propto M^{-alpha}, with an index alpha=0.60 +/- 0.11. Over a larger mass
domain, however, from 0.03 Msun to 10 Msun, the mass function is better fitted
by a log-normal function. We estimate that brown dwarfs represent about 25% of
the cluster population which nevertheless makes up less than 1.5% of the
cluster mass. The early dynamical evolution of the cluster appears to have had
little effect on its present mass distribution at an age of 120 Myr. Comparison
between the Pleiades mass function and the Galactic field mass function
suggests that apparent differences may be mostly due to unresolved binary

the pion form factor extraction from experimental data and, as a consequence,
the evaluation of a_mu^had. In fact the O(alpha) FSR corrections should be
included to reach the precision we are aiming at. We argue that for an
extraction of the desired FSR--inclusive cross section sigma^(gamma)_had a
photon--inclusive scan measurement of the ``e+e- to pi+pi- + photons'' cross
section is needed. For exclusive scan and radiative return measurements in
contrast we have to rely on ad hoc FSR models if we want to obtain either
sigma^(gamma)_had or the FSR--exclusive cross section sigma^(0)_had. We thus
advocate to consider seriously precise photon--inclusive energy scan
measurements at present and future low energy e+e- facilities. Then together
with radiative return measurements from DAFNE and BABAR and forthcoming scan
measurements at VEPP-2000 we have a good chance to substantially improve the
evaluation of a_mu^had in the future.

16 exact superconformal fermionic moduli, here the effect of the set of
additional fermionic moduli associated with the embeddings of the SU(2)
instanton in SU(N) is considered. The presence of the extra fermionic modes is
essential for matching Yang-Mills instanton effects in various correlation
functions with D-instanton effects in type IIB string theory via the AdS/CFT
conjecture. The leading terms of this kind on the string side contribute at
order 1/(alpha'), which is the same order as the R^4 interaction. For example,
the instanton contributions to correlation functions of higher dimensional
chiral primary operators are seen to match amplitudes involving Kaluza-Klein
excitations of the supergravity fields, as expected. Another example is the
matching of certain multi-fermion correlation functions which correspond to
certain multi-fermion interactions required by supersymmetry of the IIB string
effective action. Careful analysis of a variety of competing effects makes it
possible to decipher contributions corresponding to higher derivative
interactions in the IIB effective action. In this manner it is possible to
check for the presence of terms of order alpha'. Comments are also made on the
structure of instanton contributions to near-extremal correlation functions of
chiral primary operators.

with an exponent ranging from 0 to 2. The standard time-domain partial
differential equation models can describe merely two extreme cases of frequency
independent and frequency-squared dependent attenuations. The otherwise
non-zeor and non-square frequency dependency occuring in many cases of
practical interest is thus often called the anomalous attenuation. In this
study, we developed a linear integro-differential equation wave model for the
anomalous attenuation by using the space fractional Laplacian operation, and
the strategy is then extended to the nonlinear Burgers, KZK, and Westervelt
equations. A new definition of the fractional Laplacian is also introduced
which naturally includes the boundary conditions and has inherent
regularization to ease the hyper-singularity in the conventional fractional
Laplacian. Under the Szabo's smallness approximation where attenuation is
assumed to be much smaller than the wave number, our linear model is found
consistent with arbitrary frequency dependencies. According to the fact that
the physical attenuation can be understood a statistic process, the empirical
range [0,2] of the power law exponent is explained via the Levy stable
distribution theory. It is noted that the power law attentuation underlies
fractal microstructures of anomalously attenuative media.

presented. In this model, t-channel vector meson exchanges are described in
terms of Regge trajectories to comply with the correct high energy behavior. We
compare this reggeized model with an isobar model (\eta-MAID), where the
t-channel exchanges are described by \rho and \omega poles. Both models contain
the same resonance contributions, and describe current \gamma p \to \eta p data
up to E_\gamma^{lab} = 2 GeV quite well, but only the reggeized model can be
successfully extended to higher energies. For the \gamma p \to \eta' p
reaction, the reggeized model is found to be able to give a satisfactory
description. For the differential cross section data from SAPHIR, we find that
the observed linear forward rise in cos(theta) near E_\gamma^{lab} = 1.6 GeV
can be well described by the interference of an S11 resonance and the Regge
trajectory exchanges without any need for an additional P-wave resonance.

case of purely absorptive final state interactions we deduce from our

This suggests that even very small perturbations resulting from weak coupling
of a quantum chaotic environment to the position of a system whose state is a
non-local superposition will lead to rapid decoherence. However, it is also
known that quantum counterparts of classically chaotic systems lose exponential
sensitivity to initial conditions, so this expectation of enhanced decoherence
is by no means obvious. We analyze decoherence due to a ""toy"" quantum
environment that is analytically solvable, yet displays the crucial phenomenon
of exponential sensitivity to perturbations. We show that such an environment,
with a single degree of freedom, can be far more effective at destroying
quantum coherence than a heat bath with infinitely many degrees of freedom.
This also means that the standard ""quantum Brownian motion"" model for a
decohering environment may not be as universally applicable as it once was
conjectured to be.

Casimir force between dispersing and absorbing multilayered plates in the
zero-temperature limit has been studied within a 1D quantization scheme for the
electromagnetic field in the presence of causal media [R. Esquivel-Sirvent, C.
Villarreal, and G.H. Cocoletzi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 64, 052108 (2001)]. In the
present paper a rigorous 3D analysis is given, which shows that for complex
heterostructures the 1D theory only roughly reflects the dependence of the
Casimir force on the plate separation in general. Further, an extension of the
very recently derived formula for the Casimir force at zero temperature [M.S.
Toma\v{s}, Phys. Rev. A 66, 052103 (2002)] to finite temperatures is given, and
analytical expressions for specific distance laws in the zero-temperature limit
are derived. In particular, it is shown that the Casimir force between two
single-slab plates behaves asymptotically like $d^{-6}$ in place of $d^{-4}$
($d$, plate separation).

quantum mechanically. As a generic model we use a point-contact detector
coupled to an electron in a quantum dot and tunneling into the continuum.
Transition to the classical description and the mechanism of decoherence are
investigated. We concentrate on the influence of the measurement on the
electron decay rate to the continuum. We demonstrate that the Zeno (or the
anti-Zeno) effect requires a nonuniform density of states in the continuum. In
this case we show that the anti-Zeno effect relates only to the average decay
rate, whereas for sufficiently small time the Zeno effect always takes place.
We discuss the experimental consequences of our results and the role of the
projection postulate in a measurement process.
