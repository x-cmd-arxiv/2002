approximately 5 and 9 days after explosion. We parameterize the outer supernova
envelope as a power-law density profile in homologous expansion. In order to
extract information on the value of the parameters a large number of models was
required. We show that very early spectra combined with detailed models can
provide constraints on the value of the power law index, the ratio of hydrogen
to helium in the surface of the progenitor, the progenitor metallicity and the
amount of radioactive nickel mixed into the outer envelope of the supernova.
The spectral fits reproduce the observed spectra exceedingly well. The spectral
results combined with the early photometry predict that the explosion date was
4.7 \pm 0.7 days before the first spectrum was obtained. The ability to obtain
the metallicity from early spectra make SN IIP attractive probes of chemical
evolution in the universe and by showing that we have the ability to pin down
the parameters of the progenitor and mixing during the supernova explosion, it
is likely to make SN IIP useful cosmological distance indicators which are at
the same time complementary to SNe Ia.

galaxy's inclination is on the low end of the range given by Chaves & Irwin
(2001) and that the HI disk is thin (z_e = 188 pc), showing no evidence for
halo. Numerous discrete disk-halo features are observed, however, achieving z
heights up to 28 kpc from mid-plane. One prominent feature in particular, of
mass, 8X10^7 Msun and height, 22 kpc, is seen on the advancing side of the
galaxy at a projected galactocentric radius of 15.5 kpc. If this feature
achieves such high latitudes because of events in the disk alone, then input
energies of order ~ 10^{56} ergs are required. We have instead investigated the
feasibility of such a large feature being produced via buoyancy (with drag)
within a hot, pre-existing X-ray corona. Reasonable plume densities,
temperatures, stall height (~ 11 kpc), outflow velocities and ages can indeed
be achieved in this way. The advantage of this scenario is that the input
energy need only be sufficient to produce blow-out, a condition which requires
a reduction of three orders of magnitude in energy. If this is correct, there

magnitude M_814~10-10.5, approximately 5 magnitudes below the main sequence
(MS) turn-off. The MS of the two clusters are sharp and well defined and their
fiducial lines overlap almost exactly throughout this range. Their colour is,
however, more than 0.1 mag redder than the MS fiducial line of the prototype
metal-rich globular cluster 47 Tuc, after proper correction for the relative
distances and reddening. This provides solid empirical evidence of a higher
metal content, which is not surprising if these objects belong indeed to the
bulge as their present location suggests. A good fit to the upper part of the
MS of both clusters is obtained with a 10 Gyr-old theoretical isochrone from
Baraffe et al. (1998) for a metallicity of [M/H]=-0.5, but at lower luminosity
all models depart considerably from the observations, probably because of a
deficiency in the treatment of the TiO opacity. The luminosity functions
obtained from the observed CMD are rather similar to one another and show a
peak at M_814~9. The present day mass functions (PDMF) are derived down to
m~0.2 Msolar and are consistent with power-law indices alpha=0.7 for NGC6496

mass range (alpha=1.4). We investigate the origin of this discrepancy and show
that it can be understood if the two clusters contain a considerably higher
fraction of primordial binaries amongst their MS population, similar to that
expected in the bulge. We briefly discuss the implications of this finding on
the process of star and binary formation and on the universality of the IMF.

is studied in a small local patch of the disk: this is usually referred as to a
one-zone model. To take account of the low ionization fraction of the disk, the
induction equation includes both ohmic dissipation and the Hall effect. We
induce a transition from outburst to quiescence by an instantaneous decrease of
the temperature. The evolution of the MRI during the transition is found to be
very sensitive to the temperature of the quiescent disk. As long as the
temperature is higher than a critical value of about 2000 K, MHD turbulence and
angular momentum transport is sustained by the MRI. However, MHD turbulence
dies away within an orbital time if the temperature falls below this critical
value. In this case, the stress drops off by more than 2 orders of magnitude,
and is dominated by the Reynolds stress associated with the remnant motions
from the outburst. The critical temperature depends slightly on the distance

that vacuum polarization softens the high energy tail of the thermal spectrum.

galactic radius. Most of these galaxies contain a nuclear star cluster, as
discussed in a separate paper. The main goal of the present work is to
constrain the properties of stellar bulges at these extremely late Hubble
types. We find that the surface brightness profiles of the latest-type spirals
are complex, with a wide range in shapes. We have sorted our sample in a
sequence, starting with ``pure'' disk galaxies (approximately 30% of the
sample). These galaxies have exponential stellar disks that extend inwards to
within a few tens of pc from the nucleus, where the light from the nuclear
cluster starts to dominate. They appear to be truly bulge-less systems.
Progressing along the sequence, the galaxies show increasingly prominent
deviations from a simple exponential disk model on kpc scales. Traditionally,
such deviations have prompted ``bulge-disk'' decompositions. Indeed, the
surface brightness profiles of these galaxies are generally well fit by adding
a second (exponential) bulge component. However, we find that most surface
brightness profiles can be fit equally well (or better) with a single
Sersic-type R^{1/n} profile over the entire radial range of the galaxy, without
requiring a separate ``bulge'' component. We warn in a general sense against

similarity. What variations do exist in the average spectra as a function of
luminosity and environment are found to form a nearly one-parameter family in
spectrum space. We present a high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of the
variation. We measure the properties of the variation with a modified version
of the Lick index system and compare to model spectra from stellar population
syntheses. The variation may be a combination of age and chemical abundance
differences, but the conservative conclusion is that the quality of the data
considerably exceeds the current state of the models.

4536 and NGC 3664, two late-type galaxies located, respectively, at 16 and 11
Mpc. Here, we study the applicability of the SFM to HST images of galaxies in
the Local Group, and show that background galaxies cannot be easily identified
through these nearby objects, even with the best resolution available today. In
the case of M 31, each pixel in the HST images contains 50 to 100 stars, and
the background galaxies cannot be seen because of the intrinsic granularity due
to strong surface brightness fluctuations. In the LMC, on the other hand, there
is only about one star every six linear pixels, and the lack of detectable
background galaxies results from a ``secondary'' granularity, introduced by
structure in the wings of the point spread function. The success of the SFM in
NGC 4536 and NGC 3664 is a natural consequence of the reduction of the
intensity of surface brightness fluctuations with distance. When the dominant
confusion factor is structure in the PSF wings, as is the case of HST images of
the LMC, and would happen in M 31 images obtained with a 10-m diffraction-
limited optical telescope, it becomes in principle possible to improve the
detectability of background galaxies by subtracting the stars in the foreground
object. However, a much better characterization of optical PSFs than is
currently available would be required for an adequate subtraction of the wings.
Given the importance of determining the dust content of Local Group galaxies,
efforts should be made in that direction.

of the total flux density detected with the VLA at arcsecond resolution. For
this galaxy, we derive a massive star formation rate of ~84pm13 M{_\odot}

multiple components with optical depths ranging between 0.3 and 2.5, and

exist degeneracies among the various cosmological parameters constrained by the
Cosmic Microwave Background. We found that there is a degeneracy in a
combination of the Hubble parameter H_0 and of the dark energy equation of
state parameter w_Q, but that w_Q is not correlated with the primordial index n
of scalar fluctuations and the baryon content Omega_b h^2. Preferred primordial
index is n = 0.95 \pm 0.05 (68%) and baryon content Omega_b h^2 = 0.021 \pm
0.003. Adding constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations on small
scales, sigma_8, obtained from clusters abundance or weak lensing data may
allow to break the degenaracies, although present-day systematics uncertainties
do not allow firm conclusions yet. The further addition of the Hubble Space
Telescope measurements of the local distance scale and of the high redshift
supernovae data allows to obtain tight constraints. When these constraints are
combined together we find that the amount of dark energy is 0.7^{+0.10}_{-0.07}
(95% C.L.) and that its equation of state is very close to those of the vacuum:
w_Q < -0.75 (> 95% C.L.). In no case do we find that quintessence is prefered

behaviour of the Randall-Sundrum models. The data indicates that, under the
assumption that we admit zero pressure dust matter on the brane, the
cosmological constant is still needed to explain current observations. The
observations from supernovae give a large value of the density parameter for
brane matter $\Omega_{\lambda,0} \simeq 0.01$ as the best fit. For high
redshifts $z > 1.2$, the difference between the brane model and the
$\Lambda$CDM (Perlmutter) model becomes detectable observationally. From the
maximum likelihood method we obtained the favored value of $\Omega_{\lambda,0}
= 0.004 \pm 0.016$ for $\Omega_{k,0}=0$ and $\Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}=0.3$. This
gives the limit $\Omega_{\lambda,0} < 0.02$ at $1 \sigma$ level. While the
model with brane effects is preferred by the supernovae type Ia data, the model
without brane fluid is still statistically admissible. For comparison the limit
on brane effects which comes from CMB anisotropies and BBN is also obtained.
The uncertainty in the location of the first peak gives a stronger limit
$\Omega_{\lambda,0} < 1.0 \cdot 10^{-12}$, whereas from BBN we obtain that
$\Omega_{\lambda,0} < 1.0 \cdot 10^{-27}$. However, both very strict limits are
obtained with the assumption that brane effects do not change the physics in
the pre-recombination era, while the SN Ia limit is model independent.We
demonstrate that the fit to supernovae data can also be obtained if we admit
the phantom matter $p = - (4/3) \varrho$ on the brane, where this matter mimics
the influence of the cosmological constant. Finally, we propose to check for
dark radiation and brane tension by the application of the angular diameter of

I+-, I-+, I-- at $H_a \approx + 370$ Oe, where the Co magnetic spins were
mostly reversed. They show a striking behavior in the total reflection region:
while the nonspin-flip scattering exhibits no diffuse reflectivity, the
spin-flip scattering shows strong diffuse scattering at incident angles which
satisfy the resonance conditions. Moreover the spin-flip off-specular part of
the reflectivity is asymmetric. The I-+ intensity occurs at higher exit angles
than the specularly reflected neutrons, and the I+- intensity is shifted to
lower angles. Their intensities are noticeably different and there is a
splitting of the resonance positions for the up and down neutron spins
($\alpha_{n} ^{+} \ne \alpha_{n} ^{-}$) . Additionally, a strong influence of
the stray fields from magnetic domains to the resonance splitting is observed.

turns, moving along one edge at a time within a graph G=(V,E). The set of
customers is given by a subset V_C V of the vertices. At any given time, both
players know of their opponent's position. A player wins if he is able to reach
a majority of the vertices in V_C before the opponent does. We prove that the
CSP is PSPACE-complete, even if the graph is bipartite, and both players start

the absence of independent flat time. This can in principle be cured by going
out to higher dimensions. The modern paradigm assumes that the fundamental
theory of everything is some form of string theory living in space of more than
four dimensions. We advocate another possibility that the fundamental theory is
a form of D=4 higher-derivative gravity. This class of theories has a nice
feature of renormalizability so that perturbative calculations are feasible.
There are also finite N=4 supersymmetric conformal supergravity theories. This
possibility is particularly attractive. Einstein's gravity is obtained in a
natural way as an effective low-energy theory. The N=1 supersymmetric version
of the theory has a natural higher-dimensional interpretation due to Ogievetsky
and Sokatchev, which involves embedding of our curved Minkowsky space-time
manifold into flat 8-dimensional space. Assuming that a variant of the finite
N=4 theory also admit a similar interpretation, this may eventually allow one
to construct consistent quantum theory of gravity. We argue, however, that even
though future gravity theory will probably use higher dimensions as
construction scaffolds, its physical content and meaning should refer to 4
dimensions where observer lives.

initial conditions in inflation is obtained. Based on the physical conditions
before inflation, the possibility exists that the initial state of scalar
perturbations is not only the Bunch-Davies state, but also a more general state
(a squeezed state). For example, the derived formula for the power spectrum is
calculated using simple toy cosmological models. When there exists a
radiation-dominated period before inflation, the behavior of the scalar
perturbation is revealed not to vary greatly; however, from large scales to
small scales the power spectrum of the curvature perturbations oscillates
around the normal value. In addition, when inflation has a large break and the
breaking time is a radiation- dominated period, a large enhancement is revealed
to occur which depends on the length of the breaking time.

varieties first appeared in a problem in commuting matrices. We show that when
$r = m$, the varieties are irreducible, but when $r < m$, these varieties have
at least $\lfloor {k/2}\rfloor + 1$ components. In fact, when $r=2$ (for any
$k$), or when $k=2$ (for any $r$), there are exactly $\lfloor {k/2}\rfloor + 1$
components. We give formulas for the dimensions of these components in terms of
$k$, $m$, and $n$. In the case of square matrices with $r=m$, we show that the
ideals of our varieties are prime and that the coordinate rings are complete
intersection rings, and we compute the degree of our varieties via the
combinatorics of a suitable simplicial complex.

a local gain and an attractive perturbation of the refractive index, is

absence of loss and gain. In the presence of the loss and localized gain, an
instability threshold of the zero solution is found. If the loss and gain are
small, it is predicted what soliton is selected by the energy-balance
condition. Direct simulations demonstrate that only one pinned soliton is
stable in the conservative model: solitons with a larger energy relax to it via
emission of radiation, while those with a smaller energy decay. In the model
with the loss and gain, stable pinned pulses demonstrate persistent internal
vibrations and emission of radiation. If these solitons are nearly stationary,
the prediction based on the energy balance underestimates the necessary gain by
10% to 15% (due to radiation loss). If the loss and gain are larger, the
intrinsic vibrations of the pinned soliton become chaotic. The local gain
alone, without the attractive perturbation of the local refractive index,
cannot maintain a stable pinned soliton. For collisions of moving solitons with
the ""hot spot"", passage and capture regimes are identified, the capture
actually implying splitting of the soliton.

perturbation theory expansion for the relative correction for a $p_{1/2}$-state
starts from $\alpha\ln(1/Z\alpha)$-term, while for $s_{1/2}$-states it starts
from $Z\alpha^2$ term. Here $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant and $Z$ is

$(8\alpha/9\pi)[\ln(1/(Z\alpha)^2)+0.710]$. Even more interesting are

are generally expected to display similar behaviors whatever the direction of
propagation of the exciting laser beam is. In the present experiment we find
this expectation to be borne out, as long as the cw laser illumination is
moderate in strength. However, as a striking contrast in the case of high field
strengths, we find that either a large stable tether can be formed, or else
that a break-up of the interface can occur, depending on whether the laser beam
is upward or downward directed. Physically, the reason for this asymmetry can
be traced to whether total reflection can occur or not. We also present two
simple theoretical models, one based on geometrical optics, the other on wave
optics, that are able to illustrate the essence of the effect. In the case
leading to interface disruption our experimental results are compared with
those obtained by Zhang and Chang for water droplets under intense laser pulses
[Opt. Lett. \textbf{13}, 916 (1988)]. A key point in our experimental
investigations is to work with a near-critical liquid/liquid interface. The
surface tension becomes therefore significantly reduced, which thus enhances
the magnitude of the stationary deformations induced.

using intermediate-energy (mesoscopic) coherent states is possible. Our scheme
is different from previous quantum cryptographic schemes in that a short secret
key is explicitly used and in which quantum noise hides both the bit and the
key. This encryption scheme can be optically amplified. New avenues are open to
secure communications at high speeds in fiber-optic or free-space channels.

information loss and irreversibility. Here, a protocol is demonstrated allowing
one to make these transformations reversible. The pure states are diluted with
a random noise source. Using this protocol one can study optimal
transformations between states, and from this derive the unique measure of
information. This is compared to irreversible transformations where one does
not have access to noise. The ideas presented here shed some light on attempts
to understand entanglement manipulations and the inevitable irreversibility
encountered there where one finds that mixed states can contain ""bound
entanglement"".

reproduction of the statistics of the measurement outcomes for all initial
states. We first demonstrate that any POVM with separable elements can be
implemented by a separable super-operator, and develop techniques for
calculating the extreme points of POVMs under a certain class of constraint
that includes separability and PPT-ness. As examples we consider measurements
that are invariant under various symmetry groups (Werner, Isotropic,
Bell-diagonal, Local Orthogonal), and demonstrate that in these cases
separability of the POVM elements is equivalent to implementability via LOCC.
We also calculate the extrema of these classes of measurement under the groups
that we consider, and give explicit LOCC protocols for attaining them. These
protocols are hence optimal methods for locally discriminating between states
of these symmetries. One of many interesting consequences is that the best way
to locally discriminate Bell diagonal mixed states is to perform a 2-outcome
POVM using local von Neumann projections. This is true regardless of the cost
function, the number of states being discriminated, or the prior probabilities.
Our results give the first cases of local mixed state discrimination that can
be analysed quantitatively in full, and may have application to other problems
such as demonstrations of non-locality, experimental entanglement witnesses,
and perhaps even entanglement distillation.

atom in free space interacting exclusively with broadband squeezed light. We
consider atoms in a three or four-level Lambda-configuration coupled to a
high-finesse optical cavity which is driven by a squeezed light field. Raman
transitions are induced between a pair of stable atomic ground states via the
squeezed cavity mode and coherent driving fields. An analysis of the reduced
master equation for the atomic ground states shows that a three-level atomic
system has insufficient parameter flexibility to act as an effective two-level
atom interacting exclusively with a squeezed reservoir. However, the inclusion
of a fourth atomic level, coupled dispersively to one of the two ground states
by an auxiliary laser field, introduces an extra degree of freedom and enables
the desired interaction to be realised. As a means of detecting the reduced
quadrature decay rate of the effective two-level system, we examine the
transmission spectrum of a weak coherent probe field incident upon the cavity.

foundations of theoretical physics. The acquisition of information from a
quantum system is the interface of classical and quantum physics. Essential
tools for its description are Kraus matrices and positive operator valued
measures (POVMs). Special relativity imposes severe restrictions on the
transfer of information between distant systems. Quantum entropy is not a
Lorentz covariant concept. Lorentz transformations of reduced density matrices
for entangled systems may not be completely positive maps. Quantum field
theory, which is necessary for a consistent description of interactions,
implies a fundamental trade-off between detector reliability and
localizability. General relativity produces new, counterintuitive effects, in
particular when black holes (or more generally, event horizons) are involved.
Most of the current concepts in quantum information theory may then require a
reassessment.
