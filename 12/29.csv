  Journal","Astrophys.J. 587 (2003) 625-638","10.1086/368256",,"astro-ph",,"  There is evidence that cosmic rays were present in galaxies at moderately
high redshift. This suggests that magnetic fields were also present. If cosmic
rays and magnetic fields must always be close to equipartition, as they are to
an order of magnitude within the local universe, this would provide a powerful
constraint on theories of the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in
galaxies. We evaluate current theories of cosmic ray acceleration and
confinement at very low magnetic fieldstrength, and find that the properties of
small scale turbulence are fundamentally changed in the presence of cosmic
rays. As a result, magnetic fields several orders of magnitude weaker than
present galactic fields can accelerate and retain a population of relativistic
cosmic rays, provided that the fields are coherent on lengthscales greater than
a cosmic ray gyroradius.

the degeneracy of antiparallel tunneling trajectories is important. Thus, four,
six, twelve, etc., pairs of the trajectories should be taken into account (a
cascade of bifurcations). For the parallel particle tunneling the bifurcation
resembles phase transition of a first kind, while for the antiparallel transfer
it behaves as second order phase transition. The proposed theory allows for the
explanation of experimental data on quantum fluctuations in two-proton

the quasiparticle effective mass $M^*$ diverges as $M^*\propto 1/|x-x_{FC}|$

FCQPT occurs. Such a behavior is of general form and takes place in both three
dimensional (3D) systems and two dimensional (2D) ones. Since the effective
mass $M^*$ is finite, the system exhibits the Landau Fermi liquid behavior. At
$|x-x_{FC}|/x_{FC}\ll 1$, the behavior can be viewed as a highly correlated
one, because the effective mass is large and strongly depends on the density.
In case of electronic systems the Wiedemann-Franz law is held and
Kadowaki-Woods ratio is preserved. Beyond the region $|x-x_{FC}|/x_{FC}\ll 1$,
the effective mass is approximately constant and the system becomes
conventional Landau Fermi liquid.

which it is enough to provide only concentration and mobility of charge

segments representing any two adjacent nodes of $G$ are vertically visible to

representation of $G$. Given a canonical ordering of the triangulated $G$, our
algorithm draws the graph incrementally in a greedy manner. We show that one of
three canonical orderings obtained from Schnyder's realizer for the
triangulated $G$ yields a visibility representation of $G$ no wider than
$\frac{22n-40}{15}$. Our easy-to-implement O(n)-time algorithm bypasses the
complicated subroutines for four-connected components and four-block trees
required by the best previously known algorithm of Kant. Our result provides a
negative answer to Kant's open question about whether $\frac{3n-6}{2}$ is a
worst-case lower bound on the required width. Also, if $G$ has no degree-three
(respectively, degree-five) internal node, then our visibility representation
for $G$ is no wider than $\frac{4n-9}{3}$ (respectively, $\frac{4n-7}{3}$).
Moreover, if $G$ is four-connected, then our visibility representation for $G$
is no wider than $n-1$, matching the best known result of Kant and He. As a
by-product, we obtain a much simpler proof for a corollary of Wagner's Theorem

interactions is applied to study the low lying quadrupole and octupole states
in some S isotopes and giant resonances in some spherical nuclei. It is shown
that characteristics calculated within the suggested approach are in a good
agreement with available experimental data.

electron-proton scattering are analyzed in the framework of the Standard Model.
We include the complete set of one-loop contributions to one quark current
amplitudes. The contribution of soft photon emission to the asymmetry is also
calculated, giving final results free of infrared divergences. The one quark
radiative corrections, when combined with previous work on many quark effects
and recent SAMPLE experimental data, are used to place some new constraints on
electroweak form factors of the nucleon.

work in vacuum. This case can be observed by Young type double slit experiment
to be carried out. Since field-field interaction is carried through charged
particles, in the absence of charged particles linear superposition of two
fields is not possible and interference will not be observed.

(granites) imported in Cyprus for use in the building industry was measured,
employing high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy. The rock samples were
pulverized, sealed in 1 litre plastic Marinelli beakers, and measured in the
laboratory with an accumulating time between 10 and 14 hours each. From the
measured gamma-ray spectra, activity concentrations were determined for Th-232
(range from 1 to 906 Bq/kg), U-238 (from 1 to 588 Bq/kg) and K-40 (from 50 to
1606 Bq/kg). The total absorbed dose rates in air calculated from the
concentrations of the three radionuclides, Th-232 and U-238 series and K-40,
ranged from 7 to 1209 nGy/h for full utilization of the materials, from 4 to
605 nGy/h for half utilization and from 2 to 302 nGy/h for one quarter
utilization. The total effective dose rates per person indoors were determined
to be between 0.02 to 2.97 mSv/y for half utilization of the materials.
Applying dose criteria recently recommended by the EU for superficial
materials, 25 of the samples meet the exemption dose limit of 0.3 mSv/y, two of
them meet the upper dose limit of 1 mSv/y and only one exceeds clearly this
limit.

the Rn-222 concentration was registered in sampling intervals of 2 to 4 hours

were found to be in the range of 6.2 to 102.8 Bq/m**3, with an overall
arithmetic mean value of (19.3 +- 14.7) Bq/m**3. This value is by a factor of

features to the classical counterpart could lead to new quantum algorithms. In
this paper, we propose a feasible scheme to implement quantum random walks on a
line using only linear optics elements. With current single-photon interference
technology, the steps that could be experimentally implemented can be extended
to very large numbers. We also show that, by decohering the quantum states, our
scheme for quantum random walk tends to be classical.
