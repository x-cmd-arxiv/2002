galaxies is studied in a variety of physical regimes, with the aim of resolving
the ``final parsec problem,'' i.e., how black hole binaries manage to shrink to
separations at which emission of gravity waves becomes efficient. A binary
ejects stars by the gravitational slingshot and carves out a loss cone in the
host galaxy. Continued decay of the binary requires a refilling of the loss
cone. We show that the standard treatment of loss cone refilling, derived for
collisionally relaxed systems like globular clusters, can substantially
underestimate the refilling rates in galactic nuclei. We derive expressions for
non-equilibrium loss-cone dynamics and calculate time scales for the decay of
massive black hole binaries following galaxy mergers, obtaining significantly
higher decay rates than heretofore. Even in the absence of two-body relaxation,
decay of binaries can persist due to repeated ejection of stars returning to
the nucleus on eccentric orbits. We show that this recycling of stars leads to
a gradual, approximately logarithmic dependence of the binary binding energy on
time. We derive an expression for the loss cone refilling induced by the
Brownian motion of a black hole binary. We also show that numerical N-body
experiments are not well suited to probe these mechanisms over long times due
to spurious relaxation.

is focused on the question of the existence of the molecular ion $H_2^{+}$ in a
magnetic field. As a tool, a variational method with an optimization of the
form of the vector potential (optimal gauge fixing) is used. It is shown that
in the domain of applicability of the non-relativistic approximation the system
$(ppe)$ in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation has a well-pronounced minimum in
the total energy at a finite interproton distance for $B \lesssim 10^{11} G$,
thus manifesting the existence of $H_2^{+}$. For $B \gtrsim 10^{11} G$ and
large inclinations (of the molecular axis with respect to the magnetic line)
the minimum disappears and hence the molecular ion $H_2^{+}$ does not exist. It
is shown that the most stable configuration of $H_2^{+}$ always corresponds to
protons situated along the magnetic line. With magnetic field growth the ion
$H_2^{+}$ becomes more and more tightly bound and compact, and the electronic
distribution evolves from a two-peak to a one-peak pattern. The domain of
inclinations where the $H_2^{+}$ ion exists reduces with magnetic field
increase and finally becomes $0^o - 25^o$ at $B = 4.414 \times 10^{13} G$.
Phase transition type behavior of variational parameters for some interproton
distances related to the beginning of the chemical reaction $H_2^{+}
\leftrightarrow H + p$ is found.

Our result for the Coulomb logarithm appears to be independent of the number of

starts from a subsonic state at infinity, smoothly passes the fast critical
point, then supersonically falls into the horizon of the black hole. The
solutions always have the following features: 1) The specific energy of fluid
particles remains constant but the specific angular momentum is effectively
removed by the magnetic field. 2) At large radii, where the disk motion is
dominantly rotational, the energy density of the magnetic field is
equipartitioned with the rotational energy density of the disk. 3) Inside the
fast critical point, where radial motion becomes important, the ratio of the
electromagnetic energy density to the kinetic energy density drops quickly. The
results indicate that: 1) Disk accretion does not necessarily imply energy
dissipation since magnetic fields do not have to transport or dissipate a lot
of energy as they effectively transport angular momentum. 2) When resistivity
is small, the large-scale magnetic field is amplified by the shearing rotation
of the disk until the magnetic energy density is equipartitioned with the
rotational energy density, ending up with a geometrically thick disk. This is
in contrast with the evolution of small-scale magnetic fields where if the
resistivity is nonzero the magnetic energy density is likely to be
equipartitioned with the kinetic energy density associated with local random
motions (e.g., turbulence), making a thin Keplerian disk possible.

$\epsilon =10^{-6}$, the optimal frequency is around 450 Hz for interferometers
of the first generation (LIGO or VIRGO) and shifts toward 85 Hz for advanced

significant narrowing of the distribution when improving the sensitivity: with
an advanced detector, it is possible to have 90% of detection probability while
exploring less than 20% of the parameter space (7.5% in the case of $\epsilon

all the observed properties of this disk. We propose that this disk contains
three separate layers: two thin outer surfaces which contain dust grains that
are very similar to those of the ISM, and a disk interior which is relatively
massive and/or has experienced limited grain growth with the largest grains
significantly smaller than 1mm. Such a structure could naturally result from
dust settling in a protoplanetary disk.

For the case $\theta_v=0$, we can obtain the analytical results, for

the histogram can have two peaks. The percolation threshold for the
multifractal is lower than for the square lattice.
  The percolation in the multifractal differs from the percolation in the
regular lattice in two points. The first is related with the coordination
number that changes along the multifractal. The second comes from the way the
weight of each cell in the multifractal affects the percolation cluster. We
compute the fractal dimension of the percolating cluster. Despite the
differences, the percolation in a multifractal support is in the universality
class of standard percolation.

finite density and temperature, introducing a chemical potential to describe
the finite pion number density. Such description is particularly important
during the hadronic phase of a relativistic heavy-ion collision, between
chemical and thermal freeze-out, where the pion number changing processes,
driven by the strong interaction, can be considered to be frozen. We make use
of an effective Lagrangian that explicitly respects chiral symmetry through the
enforcement of the chiral Ward identities. The pion dispersion relation is
computed through the computation of the pion self-energy in a non-perturbative
fashion by giving an approximate solution to the Schwinger-Dyson equation for
this self-energy. The dispersion relation is described in terms of a density
and temperature dependent mass and an index of refraction which is also
temperature, density as well as momentum dependent. The index of refraction is
larger than unity for all values of the momentum for finite \mu and T. Given
the strong coupling between \rho vectors and pions, we argue that the
modification of the pion mass due to finite pion density effects has to be
taken into account self-consistently for the description of the in-medium

  school",,,"RUNHETC-2002-51","hep-th",,"  These talks present an overview of a tentative theory of large distance
physics. For each large distance L (in dimensionless units), the theory gives
two complementary descriptions of spacetime physics: quantum field theory at
distances larger than L, string scattering amplitudes at distances smaller than
L. The mechanism of the theory is a certain 2d nonlinear model, the
lambda-model, whose target manifold is the manifold of general nonlinear models
of the worldsurface, the background spacetimes for string scattering. So far,
the theory has only been formulated and its basic working described, in general
terms. The theory's only claims to interest at present are matters of general
principle. It is a self-contained nonperturbative theory of large distance
physics, operating entirely at large distance. The lambda-model constructs an
actual QFT at large distance, a functional integral over spacetime fields. It
constructs an effective background spacetime for string scattering at
relatively small distances. It is background independent, dynamically. Nothing
is adjustable in its formulation. It is a mechanical theory, not an S-matrix
theory. String scattering takes place at small distances within a mechanical
large distance environment. The lambda-model constructs QFT in a way that
offers possibilities of novel physical phenomena at large distances. The task
now is to perform concrete calculations in the lambda-model, to find out if it
produces a physically useful QFT.

considered anew for a conventional parallel-plate configuration, in the light
of current discussions in the literature. In the case of an ""ideal"" metal,
characterized by a refractive index equal to infinity for all frequencies, we
recover, via a somewhat unconventional method, conventional results for the
temperature dependence, meaning that the zero-frequency transverse electric
mode contributes the same as the transverse magnetic mode. For a real metal,
however, approximately obeying the Drude dispersive model at low frequencies,
we find that the zero-frequency transverse electric mode does not contribute at
all. This would appear to lead to an observable temperature dependence and a
violation of the third law of thermodynamics. It had been suggested that the
source of the difficulty was the behaviour of the reflection coefficient for
perpendicular polarization but we show that this is not the case. By
introducing a simplified model for the Casimir interaction, consisting of two
harmonic oscillators interacting via a third one, we illustrate the behavior of
the transverse electric field. Numerical results are presented based on the
refractive index for gold. A linear temperature correction to the Casimir force
between parallel plates is indeed found which should be observable in
room-temperature experiments, but this does not entail any thermodynamic
inconsistency.
