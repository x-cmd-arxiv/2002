their connection is identified. The first is important for large scale dynamo
theory: what prevents the magnetic backreaction forces from shutting down the
dynamo cycle? The second question is: what determines the handedness of twist
and writhe in magnetized coronal ejecta? Magnetic helicity conservation is
important for answering both questions. Conservation implies that dynamo
generation of large scale writhed structures is accompanied by the oppositely
signed twist along these structures. The latter is associated with the
backreaction force. We suggest that coronal mass ejections (CME's)
simultaneously liberate small scale twist and large scale writhe of opposite
sign, helping to prevent the cycle from quenching and enabling a net magnetic
flux change in each hemisphere. Observations and helicity spectrum measurements
from a simulation of a rising flux ribbon support this idea. We show a new
pictorial of dynamo flux generation that includes the backreaction and magnetic
helicity conservation by characterizing the field as a 2-D ribbon rather than a
1-D line.

which allows a set of models to be fitted exactly to the observations. Taking
our cue from the strong body of evidence that early-type galaxies are close to
isothermal, we assume that the lens is scale-free with a flat rotation curve.
However, our algorithm allows full flexibility as regards the angular structure
of the lensing potential. Importantly, all the free parameters enter linearly
into the model and so the lens and flux ratio equations can always be solved by
straightforward matrix inversion. We use this new algorithm to examine some of
the claims made for substructure on the basis of ""anomalous flux ratios"". We
demonstrate by explicit construction that some of the lenses for which
substructure has been claimed can be well-fit by smooth lens models. This is
especially the case when the systematic errors in the flux ratios (caused by
microlensing or differential extinction or scatter-broadening) are taken into
account. However, there is certainly one system (B1422+231) for which the
existing smooth models are definitely inadequate and for which substructure may
be implicated. Within a few tens of kpc of galaxy centres, dynamical friction
is efficient at dissolving any substructure. So, little substructure lies
projected within the Einstein radius of most strong lenses. The numbers of
strong lenses for which substructure is currently being claimed may be so large
that this contradicts rather than supports cold dark matter theories.

sources, satisfactory fits can be obtained. The derived model parameters show
that some group Ia sources can only be fit with radially increasing surface
densities, indicating the presence of depleted inner disk regions. The
steep-sloped SEDs of group IIa sources can be fit with very compact disks,
probably representing disks with collapsed outer regions. The largest
difficulties arise from sources that do not show significant silicate emission
features. Our attempts to explain these objects with a pure geometric effect
are only partially successful. It seems that these stars indeed require a
strong depletion of small silicate grains.

Its main feature is to acquire three simultaneous images at three wavelengths
(simultaneous differential imaging) across the methane absorption bandhead at
1.6 micron, enabling an accurate subtraction of the stellar point spread
function (PSF) and the detection of faint close methanated companions. The
instrument has no coronagraph and features a fast (1 MHz) data acquisition
system without reset anomaly, yielding high observing efficiencies on bright
stars. The performance of the instrument is described, and it is illustrated by
CFHT images of the nearby star Ups And. TRIDENT can detect (3 sigma) a
methanated companion with DeltaH=10 at 0.5 arcsec from the star in one hour of
observing time. Non-common path aberrations between the three optical paths are
the limiting factors preventing further PSF attenuation. Reference star
subtraction and instrument rotation improve the detection limit by one order of
magnitude.

the generalized time-reversal condition (with an arbitrary time shift). Such

invoking symmetries, which suppress the soft masses and non-renormalizable
terms in the potential. Other constraints on the curvaton model come from
nucleosynthesis, gravitino overproduction, and thermal evaporation. The
curvaton coupling to matter should be very small to satisfy these constraints
({\it e.g.} $h \lesssim 10^{-8}$ for typical soft masses $m \sim \TeV$).

calculations show that the inhomogeneities generated by cosmic string wakes can
strongly affect nucleosynthesis calculations. A comparison with observational
data suggests that such baryon inhomogeneities should not have existed at the
nucleosynthesis epoch. If this disagreement holds with more accurate
observations, then it will lead to the conclusions that cosmic string formation
scales above $10^{14} - 10^{15}$ GeV may not be consistent with nucleosynthesis
and CMBR observations. Alternatively, some other input in our calculation
should be constrained, for example, if the average string velocity remains
sufficiently small so that significant density perturbations are never produced
at the QCD scale, or if strings move ultra-relativistically so that string
wakes are very thin, trapping negligible amount of baryons. Finally, if

the space-time manifold admits a metric of constant curvature the propagator is
not affected by terms with higher derivatives. More generally, certain
lagrangian terms are not turned on by renormalization, if they are absent at
the tree level. This restricts the form of the action of a non-renormalizable
theory, and has applications to quantum gravity. The new action contains
infinitely many couplings, but not all of the ones that might have been
expected. In quantum gravity, the metric of constant curvature is an extremal,
but not a minimum, of the complete action. Nonetheless, it appears to be the
right perturbative vacuum, at least when the curvature is negative, suggesting
that the quantum vacuum has a negative asymptotically constant curvature. The
results of this paper give also a set of rules for a more economical use of
effective quantum field theories and suggest that it might be possible to give
mathematical sense to theories with infinitely many couplings at high energies,
to search for physical predictions.

  The spectacular failure of the Strong Energy Condition in cosmology has,
however, led many astrophysicists and cosmologists to consider models of dark
energy which violate {\em all} of the energy conditions, and indeed the current
data do not completely rule out such models. The NEC also has a questionable
status in brane cosmology: it is probably necessary to violate the NEC in the
bulk in order to obtain a ""self-tuning"" theory of the cosmological constant. In
order to investigate these proposals, we modify the Karch-Randall model by
introducing NEC-violating matter into $AdS_5$ in such a way that the brane
cosmological constant relaxes to zero. The entropy on lightsheets remains
finite. However, we still find that the spacetime is fundamentally incompatible
with the Covariant Entropy Bound machinery, in the sense that it fails the
Bousso-Randall consistency condition. We argue that holography probably forbids
all {\em cosmological} violations of the NEC, and that holography is in fact
the fundamental physical principle underlying the cosmological version of the
NEC.

is very efficient for integrating through this outer region. The second method
is a direct numerical solution of the radial Schr\""{o}dinger equation using a
discrete variable representation of the kinetic energy operator and a scaled

These mappings are constrained to provide homeomorphic structures serving as
frames of reference in order to account for the successive positions of any

morphisms of the general structures. Discrete properties of the lattice allow
the prediction of scales at which microscopic to cosmic structures should

cell to be mapped into an image cell in the next section as far as mapped cells
remain homeomorphic. If a deformation involves a fractal transformation to
objects, there occurs a change in the dimension of the cell and the
homeomorphism is not conserved. The fractal kernel stands for a ""particle"" and
the reduction of its volume is compensated by morphic changes of a finite
number of surrounding cells. Quanta of distances and quanta of fractality are
demonstrated. The interaction of a moving particle-like deformation with the
surrounding lattice involves a fractal decomposition process that supports the
existence and properties of previously postulated inerton clouds as associated

is supports the conclusion from recent neutron diffraction experiments that
there is no hydrophobic hydration around small hydrophobic groups. Analysis of
the electronic charge distribution using Wannier functions shows that the
dipole moment of ethanol increases from 1.8 D to 3.1 D upon solvation, while
the apolar ethylene molecule attains an average dipole moment of 0.5 D. For
ethylene, we identified configurations with $\pi$-H bonded water molecules,
that have rare four-fold hydrogen-bonded water coordination, yielding
instantaneous dipole moments of ethylene of up to 1 D. The results provide
valuable information for the improvement of empirical force fields, and point
out that for an accurate description of the aqueous solvation of ethanol, and
even of the apolar ethylene, polarizable force fields are required.

interacting with the quantized field in a standing-wave cavity. They
constitute, in general, an infinite-dimensional set of equations with an
infinite number of integrals of motion which may be reduced to a dynamical
system with four degrees of freedom if the quantized field is supposed to be
initially prepared in a Fock state. This system is found to produce semiquantum
chaos with positive values of the maximal Lyapunov exponent. At large values of
detuning $|\delta|\gg 1$, the Rabi atomic oscillations are usually shallow, and
the dynamics is found to be almost regular. The Doppler -- Rabi resonance, deep
Rabi oscillations that may occur at any large value of $|\delta|$ to be equal
to $|\alpha p_0|$, is found numerically and described analytically (with
$\alpha$ to be the normalized recoil frequency and $p_0$ the initial atomic
momentum). Two gedanken experiments are proposed to detect manifestations of
semiquantum chaos in real experiments. In the chaotic regime values of the
population inversion $z_{out}$, measured with atoms after transversing a
cavity, are so sensitive to small changes in the initial inversion $z_{in}$
that the probability of detecting any value of $z_{out}$ in the admissible
interval becomes almost unity in a short time. Chaotic wandering of a two-level
atom in a quantized Fock field is shown to be fractal. Fractal-like structures,
typical for chaotic scattering, are numerically found in the dependence of the
time of exit of atoms from the cavity on their initial momenta.
