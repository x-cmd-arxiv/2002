this question, we have simulated GNSS ionospheric TEC data as it would be
measured from a polar LEO (exploiting Navigation, Occultation and Reflection

model (we have explored both NeQuick and PIM). We have then developed a new
tomographic approach inspired on the physics of the hydrogen atom, which has
been compared to previous successful but somewhat awkward methods (using a
voxel representation) and employed to retrieve the Electronic Density field
from the simulated TEC data. These tomographic inversion results using
simulated data demonstrate the significant impact of GNSS-R and GNSS-NO data:
3D ionospheric Electron Density fields are retrieved over the oceans quite
accurately, even as, in the spirit of this initial study, the simulation and

to be considered as the foundation of quantum mechanics. In particular in this
approach any finite-dimensional Hilbert space describes a quantum system.
Though such a treatment might be a convenient approximation it can not be
considered as a fundamental description of a quantum system and moreover it
leads to some paradoxes like Bell's theorem.
  I present a list from seven basic postulates of axiomatic quantum mechanics.
In particular the list includes the axiom describing spatial properties of
quantum system. These axioms do not admit a nontrivial realization in the
finite-dimensional Hilbert space. One suggests that the axiomatic quantum
mechanics is consistent with local realism.

"quant-ph/0212127","Andrei Khrennikov","Andrei Khrennikov and Igor Volovich","Local Realism, Contextualism and Loopholes in Bell`s Experiments",,,,,"quant-ph gr-qc hep-th",,"  It is currently widely accepted, as a result of Bell's theorem and related
experiments, that quantum mechanics is inconsistent with local realism and
there is the so called quantum non-locality. We show that such a claim can be
justified only in a simplified approach to quantum mechanics when one neglects
the fundamental fact that there exist space and time. Mathematical definitions
of local realism in the sense of Bell and in the sense of Einstein are given.
We demonstrate that if we include into the quantum mechanical formalism the
space-time structure in the standard way then quantum mechanics might be
consistent with Einstein's local realism. It shows that loopholes are
unavoidable in experiments aimed to establish a violation of Bell`s
inequalities. We show how the space-time structure can be considered from the
contextual point of view. A mathematical framework for the contextual approach
is outlined.

Cirkovic, Dejan Rakovic","On a Possible Physical Metatheory of Consciousness",,"Open Systems & Information Dynamics Volume 9, Number 2, 153 (2002)",,,"quant-ph",,"  We show that the modern quantum mechanics, and particularly the theory of
decoherence, allows formulating a sort of a physical metatheory of
consciousness. Particularly, the analysis of the necessary conditions for the
occurrence of decoherence, along with the hypothesis that consciousness bears
(more-or-less) well definable physical origin, leads to a wider physical
picture naturally involving consciousness. This can be considered as a sort of
a psycho-physical parallelism, but on very wide scales bearing some
cosmological relevance.

the final state of a qubit, which is an object of the so-called nonideal
quantum measurement of the first kind. We show that the fidelity of a nonideal
measurement can be greater than the fidelity of the corresponding ideal
measurement. This result is somewhat counterintuitive, and can be traced back
to the quantum parallelism in quantum operations, in analogy with the quantum
parallelism manifested in the quantum computing theory. In particular, while
the quantum parallelism in quantum computing underlies efficient quantum
algorithms, the quantum parallelism in quantum information theory underlies
this, classically unexpected, increase of the fidelity.
