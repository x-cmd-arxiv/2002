could form an eccentric disk, following tidal disruption by a massive black
hole in the center of a galaxy. As a function of central black hole mass, we
constrain the core radii and central densities of cluster progenitors capable
of becoming nearly Keplerian disks which can support lopsided slow modes. We
find that progenitor stellar clusters with core radii less than a pc and
densities above a few times 10^5 Msol/pc^3 are likely eccentric disk
progenitors near a massive black hole of mass 10^7 to 10^8 Msol. Lower density
and larger progenitor cores are capable of causing eccentric stellar disks near
more massive black holes. Our constraints on the progenitor cores are
consistent with existing N-body simulations, which in one case has produced an
eccentric disk. For M31 and NGC 4486B, the estimated progenitor cluster cores
are dense and compact compared to Galactic globular clusters, however the cores
of nearby galaxies such as M33, M32 and M31 itself are in the right regime. If
galaxy mergers can create eccentric disks, then they would be a natural
consequence of hierarchical galaxy formation.

from ESA has similar goals. The motivation for both of these space missions is
the detection and spectroscopic characterization of extrasolar terrestrial
planet atmospheres. Of special interest are atmospheric biomarkers--such as O2,
O3, H2O, CO and CH4--which are either indicative of life as we know it,
essential to life, or can provide clues to a planet's habitability. A mission
capable of measuring these spectral features would also obtain sufficient
signal-to-noise to characterize other terrestrial planet properties. For
example, physical characteristics such as temperature and planetary radius can
be constrained from low- resolution spectra. In addition, planet
characteristics such as weather, rotation rate, presence of large oceans or
surface ice, and existence of seasons could be derived from photometric
measurements of the planet's variability. We will review the potential to
characterize terrestrial planets beyond their spectral signatures. We will also
discuss the possibility to detect strong surface biomarkers--such as Earth's
vegetation red edge near 700 nm--that are different from any known atomic,

(Lynden-Bell's) bars and common fast bars are given. This mechanism consists in
a certain instability that is akin to the well-known radial orbit instability;
it is caused by the mutual attraction and alignment of axes of precessing star
orbits (up to now, such a way of formation was considered only for slow bars).
  The general theory of the low-frequency modes of a disk consisting of
precessing orbits (at different angular velocities) is presented. The problem
of determining these modes is reduced to the integral equations of a rather
simple structure. The characteristic pattern speeds ($\Omega_p$) of the
low-frequency modes are of order of the mean orbit precession speeds
($\bar\Omega_{pr}$). The bar-modes also belong to this type of modes. The slow
bars have $\Omega_p \approx \bar\Omega_{pr}$; for the fast bars, $\Omega_p$ may
far exceed even the maximum precessing speed of disk orbits (however,
$\Omega_p$ remains to be of order of these precessing speeds). The possibility
of such an excess of $\Omega_p$ over $\Omega_{pr}^{\max}$ is connected with the
effect of ``repelling'' orbits that tend to move in the direction opposite to
that they are being pushed.
  The preliminary analysis of the orbit precession patterns for a number of
typical potentials is given. It is noted that the maximum radius of the
``attracting'' circular orbits ($r_c$) may be used as a reasonable estimate of
a bar length.

within the context of simple closure considerations for models of strong

closure models will necessarily introduce a suite of transport coefficients,
all of which are to some degree model-dependent. One of the most important
coefficients is the relaxation time for the turbulent Maxwell stress, which
until recently has been relatively ignored. We discuss this relaxation within
the context of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in steady high Reynolds-number,
high magnetic-Reynolds-number shearing flows. The relaxation time for the
turbulent Maxwell stress is not limited by the shear time scale, in contrast
with Reynolds-stress closure models for purely hydrodynamical turbulence. The
anisotropy of the turbulent stress tensor for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,
even for the case of zero mean-field considered here, can therefore not be
neglected. This shear-generated anisotropy can be interpreted as being due to
an effective turbulent elasticity, in analogy to the Boussinesq turbulent
viscosity. We claim that this turbulent elasticity should be important for any
astrophysical problem in which the turbulent stress in quasi-steady shear has
been treated phenomenologically with an effective viscosity.

  http://picard.ups-tlse.fr/~schlenker v2: no major change but many corrections",,,,"math.GT math.DG",,"  Let $(M, \dr M)$ be a 3-manifold with incompressible boundary that admits a
convex co-compact hyperbolic metric. We consider the hyperbolic metrics on $M$
such that $\dr M$ looks locally like a hyperideal polyhedron, and we
characterize the possible dihedral angles.
  We find as special cases the results of Bao and Bonahon on hyperideal
polyhedra, and those of Rousset on fuchsian hyperideal polyhedra. Our results
can also be stated in terms of circle configurations on $\dr M$, they provide
an extension of the Koebe theorem on circle packings.
  The proof uses some elementary properties of the hyperbolic volume, in
particular the Schl\""afli formula and the fact that the volume of (truncated)
hyperideal simplices is a concave function of the dihedral angles.

real-time data acquisition and control requirements of fast feedback loops,
machine protection systems, pulse-to-pulse sequencing, and machine-experiment
communications at next-generation pulsed accelerators such as the Next Linear
Collider (""NLC""). The fabric is constructed from ""platform"" or
""system-on-a-chip"" field programmable gate arrays (""FPGAs"") containing embedded
processors, block memory, and multi-gigabit serial transceivers interconnected
via an array of point-to-point fiber-optic physical links for standard networks
such as gigabit Ethernet. The FPGA-based link hardware segments messages of
varying priorities into a continuous sequence of fixed-length data cells,
interrupting the cell stream of lower priority messages with those comprising
higher priority traffic. A high level of noise-tolerance is provided by
dedicating almost half the contents of each cell to Reed-Solomon forward error
correcting code (""ECC"") data. Further reliability is achieved by hardware
implementation of algorithms for cell-by-cell receipt acknowledgment, receipt
timeout and retransmission after a tunable round-trip propagation delay, and
separate backpressure flow control for each priority.
