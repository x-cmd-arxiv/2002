adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations. The baryon and cold dark matter
isocurvature modes differ only by an observationally null mode in which the two
perturbations almost exactly compensate, and therefore have proportional
effects at linear order. We discuss the CMB anisotropy in general mixed models,
and give a simple approximate analytic result for the large scale CMB
anisotropy. Working numerically we use the latest WMAP observations and a
variety of other data to constrain the curvaton model. We find that models with
an isocurvature contribution are not favored relative to simple purely
adiabatic models. However a significant primordial totally correlated baryon
isocurvature perturbation is not ruled out. Certain classes of curvaton model
are thereby ruled out, other classes predict enough non-Gaussianity to be
detectable by the Planck satellite. In the appendices we review the relevant
equations in the covariant formulation and give series solutions for the
radiation dominated era.

0.3pc) and consists of at least four dense cores which are likely to be
prestellar in nature. To study the dust properties of the ridge and its
embedded cores, we combined the dust emission data with dust extinction data
obtained by Lada et al. (1999) from the NIR colors of background giant stars.
The ridge shows dust extinctions above ~10mag, rising up to 35mag in the cores.
  A map of dust temperatures, constructed from the continuum flux ratios, shows
significant temperature gradients: we find temperatures of up to ~20K in the
outskirts and between the cores, and down to ~10K in the cores themselves. The
cores themselves are almost isothermal. We used the extinction data to derive
in addition a map of the dust emissivity. Its average value agrees well with
the canonical value of Mathis (1990). We find that the dust emissivity
parametrized by kappa_850/kappa_V increases by a factor of about 4 when the
dust temperature decreases from ~20K to ~12K. A Monte Carlo simulation shows
that this change is significant with regard to the estimated calibration
uncertainties. This is consistent with models of dust evolution in prestellar
cores by Ossenkopf & Henning (1994) and with the previous detection of
gas-phase depletion of CO in one of the IC5146 cores by Kramer et al. 1999.

the noise expected in the reconstructed gravitational field, taking into
account the uncertainties associated with a finite survey, photometric redshift
uncertainty, redshift-space distortions, and multiple scattering events. In
order to implement this approach for future data analysis, we simulate the
lensing distortion fields due to various mass distributions. We create
catalogues of galaxies sampling this distortion in three dimensions, with
realistic spatial distribution and intrinsic ellipticity for both ground-based
and space-based surveys. Using the resulting catalogues of galaxy position and
shear, we demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct the lensing and
gravitational potentials with our method. For example, we demonstrate that a
typical ground-based shear survey with redshift limit z=1 and photometric
redshifts with error Delta z=0.05 is directly able to measure the 3-D
gravitational potential for mass concentrations >10^14 M_\odot between
0.1<z<0.5, and can statistically measure the potential at much lower mass
limits. The intrinsic ellipticity of objects is found to be a serious source of
noise for the gravitational potential, which can be overcome by Wiener
filtering or examining the potential statistically over many fields. We examine
the use of the 3-D lensing potential to measure mass and position of clusters
in 3-D, and to detect clusters behind clusters.

conditions. Comparison of the CO line intensities with a large velocity
gradient, escape probability model indicates that the bulk of the 2-5 x 10^7
solar masses of molecular gas in the central 180 pc is highly excited. A model
with T ~ 120 K, n_H_2 ~ 4.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 is consistent with the observed CO
intensities as well as the rotational H2 lines observed with ISO.
  The inferred mass of warm, dense molecular gas is 10--30 times the atomic gas
mass as traced through its [CII] and [OI] line emission. This large mass ratio
is inconsistent with photodissociation region models where the gas is heated by
far-UV starlight. It is also not likely that the gas is heated by shocks in
outflows or cloud-cloud collisions. We conclude that the best mechanism for
heating the gas is cosmic rays, which provide a natural means of uniformly
heating the full volume of molecular clouds. With the tremendous supernova rate
in the nucleus of NGC 253, the CR heating rate is at least ~800 times greater
than in the Galaxy, more than sufficient to match the cooling observed in the
CO lines.

that the universe is currently dominated by a low density vacuum energy, leads
to at least two potential problems which modern cosmology must address. First,
there is the old cosmological constant problem, with a new twist: the
coincidence problem. Secondly, cosmology still lacks a model to predict the
observed current cosmic acceleration and to determine whether or not there is a
future exit out of this state (as previously in the inflationary case). This
constitutes (what is called here) a dynamical problem. In this article a
framework is proposed to address these two problems, based on treating the
cosmic background vacuum (dark) energy as both dynamical and interacting. The
universe behaves as a vacuum-driven cosmic engine which, in search of
equilibrium, always back-reacts to vacuum-induced accelerations by increasing
its inertia (internal energy) through vacuum energy dissipation. The process
couples cosmic vacuum (dark) energy to matter to produce future-directed
increasingly comparable amplitudes in these fields by setting up oscillations
in the decaying vacuum energy density and corresponding sympathetic ones in the
matter fields. By putting bounds on the relative magnitudes of these coupled
oscillations the model offers a natural and conceptually simple channel to
discuss the coincidence problem, while also suggesting a way to deal with the
dynamical problem. A result with useful observational implications is an
equation of state w(t) which specifically predicts a variable, quasi-periodic,
acceleration for the current universe. This result can be directly tested by
future observational techniques such as SNAP.

the next decade the precision of these tests, most of which involve
measurements of CMB anisotropy and polarization, will improve 30 fold or

distinct dynamical components are identified on the basis of the orbital
parameters of stars in the galaxy: a slowly rotating, centrally concentrated
spheroid and a disk-like component largely supported by rotation. These
components are also recognized in the surface brightness profile of the galaxy,
which can be very well approximated by the superposition of an R^{1/4} spheroid
and an exponential disk. However, neither does the dynamically-identified
spheroid follow de Vaucouleurs' law nor is the disk purely exponential, a
resultwhich calls for caution when estimating the importance of the disk from
traditional photometric decomposition techniques. The disk may be further
decomposed into a thin, dynamically cold component with stars on nearly
circularorbits and a hotter, thicker component with orbital parameters
transitional between the thin disk and the spheroid. The spheroid is old, and
has essentiallyno stars younger than the time elapsed since the last major
accretion event ~8 Gyr ago. The majority of thin disk stars, form after the
merging activity is over, although a significant fraction ~15% of thin-disk
stars are old enough to predate the last major merger event. This unexpected
population of old disk stars consists mainly of the tidal debris of satellites
whose orbital plane was coincident with the disk and whose orbits were
circularized by dynamical friction prior to full disruption. Our results
highlight the role of satellite accretion events in shaping the disk and the
spheroidal component and reveal some of the clues to the assembly process of a
galaxy preserved in the detailed dynamics of old stellar populations.

hydrodynamic gas simulations, which predict the 2D gas dynamics arising in
response to empirical gravitational potentials, which are combinations of
differing stellar disk and dark halo contributions. The gravitational potential
of the stellar disk was derived from near-infrared photometry, color-corrected
to constant (M/L); the dark halo was modelled by an isothermal sphere with a
core. Hydrodynamic gas simulations were performed for each galaxy for a
sequence of five different mass fractions of the stellar disk and for a wide
range of spiral pattern speeds. These two parameters mainly determine the
modelled gas distribution and kinematics. The agreement between the
non-axisymmetric part of the simulated and observed gas kinematics permitted us
to conclude that the galaxies with the highest rotation velocities tend to
possess near-maximal stellar disks. In less massive galaxies, with v_max<200
km/s, the mass of the dark halo at least equals the stellar mass within 2-3
R_disk. The simulated gas morphology provides a powerful tool to determine the
dominant spiral pattern speed. The corotation radius for all galaxies was found
to be constant at R_corotation ~ 3 R_disk and encloses the strong part of the

is a $p-wave$ superconductor where mid-gap surface states play an important
role in the tunneling processes and help the formation of Kondo resonance. The
novel physics in these systems beyond that encountered in quantum dots coupled
only to to normal leads is that electron transport at finite bias $eV$ in $SKN$

occurrence of dissipative current even when the bias $eV$ is smaller than the
superconducting gap $\Delta$. Using the slave boson mean field approximation
the current, shot-noise power and Fano factor are calculated as functions of
the applied bias voltage in the sub-gap region $eV < \Delta$ and found to be
strongly dependent on the ratio $t_K$ between the Kondo temperature $T_{K}$ and
the superconducting gap $\Delta$. In particular, for large values of $t_K$ the
attenuation of current due to the existence of the superconducting gap is
compensated by the Kondo effect. This scenario is manifested also in the

of algorithms for supervised learning from examples. It is assumed that the
examples are described by attribute-value pairs, where the values are symbolic.
Cross-validation requires a set of training examples and a set of testing
examples. The value of the attribute that is to be predicted is known to the
learner in the training set, but unknown in the testing set. The theory
demonstrates that cross-validation error has two components: error on the
training set (inaccuracy) and sensitivity to noise (instability). This general
theory is then applied to voting in instance-based learning. Given an example
in the testing set, a typical instance-based learning algorithm predicts the
designated attribute by voting among the k nearest neighbors (the k most
similar examples) to the testing example in the training set. Voting is
intended to increase the stability (resistance to noise) of instance-based
learning, but a theoretical analysis shows that there are circumstances in
which voting can be destabilizing. The theory suggests ways to minimize
cross-validation error, by insuring that voting is stable and does not

involves several tasks, including rapid and accurate interpretation of patterns
in engine sensor data. We have investigated contextual normalization for the
development of a software tool to help engine repair technicians with
interpretation of sensor data. Contextual normalization is a new strategy for
employing machine learning. It handles variation in data that is due to
contextual factors, rather than the health of the engine. It does this by
normalizing the data in a context-sensitive manner. This learning strategy was
developed and tested using 242 observations of an aircraft gas turbine engine
in a test cell, where each observation consists of roughly 12,000 numbers,
gathered over a 12 second interval. There were eight classes of observations:
seven deliberately implanted classes of faults and a healthy class. We compared
two approaches to implementing our learning strategy: linear regression and
instance-based learning. We have three main results. (1) For the given problem,
instance-based learning works better than linear regression. (2) For this
problem, contextual normalization works better than other common forms of
normalization. (3) The algorithms described here can be the basis for a useful
software tool for assisting technicians with the interpretation of sensor data.

the evolutionary computation community. The misunderstandings appear to fall
into two general categories. Firstly, it is commonly believed that the Baldwin
effect is concerned with the synergy that results when there is an evolving
population of learning individuals. This is only half of the story. The full
story is more complicated and more interesting. The Baldwin effect is concerned
with the costs and benefits of lifetime learning by individuals in an evolving
population. Several researchers have focussed exclusively on the benefits, but
there is much to be gained from attention to the costs. This paper explains the
two sides of the story and enumerates ten of the costs and benefits of lifetime
learning by individuals in an evolving population. Secondly, there is a cluster
of misunderstandings about the relationship between the Baldwin effect and
Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics. The Baldwin effect is not
Lamarckian. A Lamarckian algorithm is not better for most evolutionary
computing problems than a Baldwinian algorithm. Finally, Lamarckian inheritance
is not a better model of memetic (cultural) evolution than the Baldwin effect.

tetrahedra are space-like. Recently, Livine and Oriti proposed to introduce a
causal structure into the Lorentzian Barrett--Crane model from which one can
construct a path integral that corresponds to the causal (Feynman) propagator.
We show how to obtain convergent integrals for the 10j-symbols and how a
dimensionless constant can be introduced into the model. We propose a `Wick
rotation' which turns the rapidly oscillating complex amplitudes of the Feynman
path integral into positive real and bounded weights. This construction does
not yet have the status of a theorem, but it can be used as an alternative
definition of the propagator and makes the causal model accessible by standard
numerical simulation algorithms. In addition, we identify the local symmetries
of the models and show how their four-simplex amplitudes can be re-expressed in
terms of the ordinary relativistic 10j-symbols. Finally, motivated by possible
numerical simulations, we express the matrix elements that are defined by the
model, in terms of the continuous connection variables and determine the most
general observable in the connection picture. Everything is done on a fixed
two-complex.

Here, we introduce the alternative Janet-Riquier theory and use it to consider
the Riemann-Lanczos problem in 2 and 3 dimensions. We find that in 2
dimensions, the Riemann-Lanczos problem is a differential system in involution.
It depends on one arbitrary function of 2 independent variables when no
differential gauge condition is imposed but on 2 arbitrary functions of one
independent variable when the differential gauge condition is imposed. For each
of the two possible signatures we give the general solution in both instances
to show that the occurrence of characteristic coordinates need not affect the
result. In 3 dimensions, the Riemann-Lanczos problem is not in involution as a
identity occurs. This does not prevent the existence of singular solutions. A
prolongation of this problem, where an integrability condition is added, leads
to an involutory prolonged system and thereby generates non-singular solutions
of the prolonged Riemann-Lanczos problem. We give a singular solution for the
unprolonged Riemann-Lanczos problem for the 3-dimensional reduced Goedel
spacetime.

dimension. We model the brane as the ""plane"" of collision of waves propagating
in opposite directions along the extra dimension. This plane is a jump
discontinuity which presents the usual ${\bf Z}_2$ symmetry of brane models.
The model reproduces the {\em generalized} Friedmann equation for the evolution
on the brane, regardless of the specific details in $5D$. Model solutions with
spacelike extra coordinate show the usual {\em big-bang} behavior, while those
with timelike extra dimension present a {\em big bounce}. This bounce is an

the extra dimension is small today, but it is {\em increasing} if the universe

of color dipole states of the photon and collective Weizs\""acker-Williams (WW)
gluon structure function of a nucleus. The point that all observables for DIS
off nuclei are uniquely calculable in terms of the nuclear WW glue amounts to a
new form of factorization in the saturation regime.
  We start with the theory of multichannel propagation of color dipoles in a
nuclear medium including the color-singlet to color-octet to color-octet
transitions. We show how the Glauber-Gribov formulas are recovered from the
multichannel formalism. Then we derive the two-plateau momentum distribution of
final state (FS) quarks produced in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) off nuclei
in the saturation regime. Then we comment on the signatures of saturation in
exclusive diffractive DIS. A large body of these lectures is on the recent
theory of jet-jet inclusive cross sections. We show that for hard dijets the
decorrelation momentum is of the order of the nuclear saturation momentum
$Q_A$. For minijets with the transverse momentum below the saturation scale we
predict a complete disappearance of the azimuthal jet-jet correlation. We
conclude with comment on a possible relevance of the decorrelation of jets to
the experimental data from the STAR-RHIC Collaboration.

example, a black hole of mass ${\rm few} \times M_\odot$ would shed most of its
mass in $\sim 10^4 - 10^5$ years if the AdS radius is $L \sim 10^{-1}$ mm,
currently the upper bound from table-top experiments. Since this is within the
mass range of X-ray binary systems containing a black hole, the evaporation
enhanced by the hidden sector CFT modes could cause the disappearance of X-ray
sources on the sky. This would be a striking signature of RS2 with a large AdS
radius. Alternatively, for shorter AdS radii, the evaporation would be slower.
In such cases, the persistence of X-ray binaries with black holes already
implies an upper bound on the AdS radius of $L \la 10^{-2}$ mm, an order of
magnitude better than the bounds from table-top experiments. The observation of
primordial black holes with a mass in the MACHO range $M \sim 0.1 - 0.5
M_\odot$ and an age comparable to the age of the universe would further
strengthen the bound on the AdS radius to $L \la {\rm few} \times 10^{-6} $ mm.

contributions in the small momentum expansion one obtains already a very good
equation of state of isospin symmetric nuclear matter. We find that in the
region below nuclear matter saturation density the effective nucleon mass
$\widetilde M^*(\rho)$ deviates by at most 15% from its free space value $M$,
with $0.89M<\widetilde M^*(\rho)<M$ for $\rho < 0.11 {\rm fm}^{-3}$ and
$\widetilde M^*(\rho)>M$ for higher densities. The parameterfree strength of
the $(\vec\nabla \rho)^2$-term, $F_\nabla(k_f)$, is at saturation density
comparable to that of phenomenological Skyrme forces. The magnitude of
$F_J(k_f)$ accompanying the squared spin-orbit density $\vec J ^2$ comes out
somewhat larger. The strength of the nuclear spin-orbit interaction,
$F_{so}(k_f)$, as given by iterated one-pion exchange is about half as large as
the corresponding empirical value, however, with the wrong negative sign. The
novel density dependencies of $\widetilde M^*(\rho)$ and $F_{\nabla,so,J}(k_f)$
as predicted by our parameterfree calculation should be examined in nuclear
structure calculations (after introducing an additional short range spin-orbit
contribution constant in density).
