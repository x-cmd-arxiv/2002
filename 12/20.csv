including the RCS survey results raises sigma8 significantly and forces other

accretion discs have often been treated as resulting from an isotropic
effective viscosity, related to the pressure through the alpha parametrization
of Shakura & Sunyaev. This simple approach may be adequate for the simplest
aspects of accretion disc theory, and was necessitated historically by an
incomplete understanding of the origin of the turbulence. More recently, Balbus
& Hawley have shown that the magnetorotational instability provides a robust
mechanism of generating turbulent Reynolds and Maxwell stresses in sufficiently
ionized discs. The alpha viscosity model fails to describe numerous aspects of
this process. This paper introduces a new analytical model that aims to
represent more faithfully the dynamics of magnetorotational turbulent stresses
and bridge the gap between analytical studies and numerical simulations.
Covariant evolutionary equations for the mean Reynolds and Maxwell tensors are
presented, which correctly include the linear interaction with the mean flow.
Non-linear and dissipative effects, in the absence of an imposed magnetic flux
and in the limit of large Reynolds number and magnetic Reynolds number, are
modelled through five non-linear terms that represent known physical processes
and are strongly constrained by symmetry properties and dimensional
considerations. The resulting model should be particularly useful in
understanding the dynamics of warped, eccentric and tidally distorted discs,
non-Keplerian accretion flows close to black holes, and a variety of
time-dependent accretion phenomena.

show that there is an instability of the Oldroyd-B fluid that is physically
distinct from both the inertial and elastic instabilities described previously
in the literature, but is directly equivalent to the magnetorotational
instability in MHD. It occurs even when the specific angular momentum increases
outwards, provided that the angular velocity decreases outwards; it derives
from the kinetic energy of the shear flow and does not depend on the curvature
of the streamlines. However, we argue that the elastic instability of
viscoelastic Couette flow has no direct equivalent in MHD.

curve alone. There currently exists enough information to calibrate luminosity
distances and independent redshifts for nine bursts. From these, a GRB Hubble
diagram can be constructed, where the observed shape of the curve provides a
record of the expansion history of our Universe. The current nine burst diagram
is sparse, yet formal limits can be placed on the mass density of a flat
Universe. This first GRB Hubble diagram provides a proof of concept for a new
technique in cosmology at very high redshifts. With the launch of the SWIFT

> 60% of the baryonic content of the universe is not observed at z=0 and ii)
that the properties of small clusters do not agree with simple expectations,
could be closely related. As shown by recent studies, the shock-heating
associated with the formation of large-scale structures heats the intergalactic
medium (IGM) and leads to a ``warm IGM'' component for the gas. In the same
spirit, we suggest the intracluster medium (ICM) to be a mixture of
galaxy-recycled, metal enriched gas and intergalactic gas, shock-heated by the
collapsing much larger scales. This could be obtained through two processes: 1)
the late infalling gas from the external warm IGM is efficiently mixed within
the halo and brings some additional entropy, or 2) the shocks generated by
larger non-linear scales are also present within clusters and can heat the ICM.
We show that if assumption (1) holds, the entropy brought by the warm IGM is
sufficient to explain the observed properties of clusters, in particular the
entropy floor and the LX-T relation. On the other hand, we briefly note that
the scenario (2) would require a stronger shock-heating because of the larger
density of the ICM as compared with filaments. Our scenario of clusters being
""born warm"" can be checked through the predicted redshift evolution of the
entropy floor.

spectral parameter is E_p, the energy of the maximum E^2 N_E propto nu f_nu.
Thus F_T vs. E_p is a useful description of a detector's sensitivity. I find
that Swift will be marginally more sensitive than BATSE for E_p>100 keV, but
significantly more sensitive for E_p<100 keV. Because of its low energy
sensitivity, the FREGATE on HETE-2 is surprisingly sensitive below E_p=100 keV.
Both the WFC on BeppoSAX and the WXM on HETE-2 are/were sensitive for low E_p.

will be significantly more sensitive than Swift. The BeppoSAX GRBM was less

remarkably narrow distribution for bursts of similar peak flux, with values
between 150 and 600 keV for most faint bursts. This result is surprising within
the framework of internal shock models, since spectral shifts associated with
the jet's blue shift (by a Lorentz factor of Gamma) and the cosmological red
shift (by a factor of 1+z) should cause substantial smearing in the
distribution of the spectral peak in the jet's co-moving frame, E_rest. For the
general case where the luminosity (L) varies as Gamma^N and E_rest varies as
Gamma^M, then the observed E_peak will vary as L^{(M+1)/N}(1+z)^{-1}. For two
independent set of 20 and 84 bursts, E_peak(1+z) varies as a power law of the
luminosity with an index of (M+1)/N=0.36+-0.03. With this measured value, the
above functional dependence of E_peak on L and z results in E_peak being
roughly constant for bursts of similar peak flux, P_256. Thus, the kinematic
smearing will be small, hence allowing the E_peak distribution to be narrow.
This model also predicts that bright bursts will have high E_peak values
because they all have some combination of high luminosity (and hence a large
blue shift Gamma) and a nearby distance (and hence a small cosmological red
shift). Quantitatively, E_peak should vary roughly as P_256^0.36, and this
model prediction is strikingly confirmed with BATSE data by Mallozzi et al. A
prediction of this model is that GRBs at very high red shift z~10 should all
appear with E_peak at ~200 keV. A further prediction of this model is that
normal bursts with P_256 below the BATSE trigger threshold will appear as x-ray
flashes with E_peak~70 keV; just as is reported by Kippen et al. and Heise et
al.

fluid around a Kerr black hole is investigated. We focus on the plunging region
between the black hole horizon and the marginally stable circular orbit in the
equatorial plane. Adopting the kinematic approximation where the dynamical
effects of magnetic fields are ignored, we exactly solve Maxwell's equations
with the assumptions that the geodesic motion of the fluid is stationary and
axisymmetric, the magnetic field has only radial and azimuthal components and
depends only on time and radial coordinates. We show that the stationary state
of the magnetic field in the plunging region is uniquely determined by the
boundary conditions at the marginally stable circular orbit. If the magnetic
field at the marginally stable circular orbit is in a stationary state, the
magnetic field in the plunging region will quickly settle into a stationary
state if it is not so initially, in a time determined by the dynamical time
scale. The radial component of the magnetic field at the marginally stable
circular orbit is more important than the toroidal component in determining the
structure and evolution of the magnetic field in the plunging region. Even if
at the marginally stable circular orbit the toroidal component is zero, in the
plunging region a toroidal component is quickly generated from the radial
component by the shear motion of the fluid. Finally, we show that the dynamical
effects of magnetic fields are unimportant in the plunging region if they are
negligible on the marginally stable circular orbit. This supports the
``no-torque inner boundary condition'' of thin disks, contrary to the claim in
the recent literature.

results highlight the effects of stellar feedback and photoionization on the
baryon content and star formation of galaxies with virial temperatures of
approximately 10^4K. Dwarf sized dark matter halos that assemble prior to
reionization are able to form stars. Most halos of similar mass that assemble
after reionization do not form stars by redshift of three. Dwarf galaxies that
form stars show large variations in their gas content because of stellar
feedback and photoionization effects. Baryon-to-dark matter mass ratios are
found to lie below the cosmic mean as a result of stellar feedback. The
supposed substructure problem of CDM is critically assessed on the basis of
these results. The star formation histories modulated by radiative and stellar

matter halos with embedded misaligned disks. This issue is of particular
interest at the present time since most of the observed multiple lens systems
have magnification ratios and image geometries that are not well-fit by
standard mass models. The presence of substructure exterior to the lens has
been invoked by several authors in the context of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models
in order to explain the anamolous magnification ratios. We emphasize that the
anomalous magnification ratios may be an artifact of the simple one-component
mass models currently in use; the inclusion of a misaligned disk may be able to
mimic the effect of substructure. These slight spatial offsets between the dark
matter halo and the disk, which are likely to occur during or as a consequence
of interactions or mergers, lead to complex image configurations and
non-standard magnification ratios. We investigate two illustrative lens models:
a spiral disk embedded within a dark matter halo, and a compact disk-like
component within an elliptical galaxy. The expected fraction of galaxies with a
misaligned disk is estimated to be of the order of 10%. In such cases we find
that the resultant lensing geometries are unusual, with high image
multiplicities. The caustic structures - both radial and tangential - are
drastically modified and the magnification ratios differ compared to
expectations from standard lens models. The additional parameters required to
specify the relative alignment of the mass components in the primary lens
introduce yet another source of uncertainty in the mass modeling of
gravitational lens systems.

properties of early-type galaxies. Statistical properties, like magnification
cross sections and the expected number of quad (four-image) lens systems, are
not affected greatly by the inclusion of discs that contain less than about 10
per cent of the total stellar mass. However, the properties of individual lens
systems are affected. We estimate that 10-30 per cent of all quad lens systems,
with early-type deflector galaxies, would be affected measurably by the
presence of disc components. Intriguingly, the image magnification ratios are
altered significantly. The amplitude of the predicted change is sufficient to
explain the observed magnification ratios in systems like B1422+231 without
requiring compact substructure. Furthermore, time delays between images also
change; fitting a bulge-only model to early-type lenses that in fact contain a
disc would yield a value of the Hubble constant H_0 that is systematically too

mass 3.8Msun and temperature 22K, located downstream of the bright optical HH
knots. However, a compact emission peak lies within ~0.01pc of the
low-excitation H2-prominent shocks, with a luminosity consistent with local
heating by the outflow.
  The HCO+ emission shows two velocity components: firstly, ambient-velocity
gas lying in a region roughly corresponding to the dust clump, with abundance
enhanced by a factor of a few close to the H2-prominent knots. Secondly a
component of high-velocity emission (20 km/s linewidth), found mainly in a
collimated jet linking the low-excitation HH objects. In this high-velocity
jet, the line wings show an abundance ratio HCO+/CO proportional to v^2, with
an HCO+ enhancement compared with ambient gas of up to 10^3 at the most extreme
velocities. Such high abundances are consistent with models of shock chemistry
in turbulent mixing layers at the interaction boundaries of jets. Extrapolating
this effect to low velocities suggests that the more modest HCO+ enhancement in
the clump gas could be caused by low velocity shocks. A UV precursor may not,
therefore be necessary to explain the elevated HCO+ abundance in this gas.

covered up to four months with almost daily spectra. Our spectra typically
cover most of the visual spectral range with a high spectral resolution (about
20,000 or more). This allows us to investigate the variability in many lines
and on many time scales from days to years. We find a correlation between the
photospheric HeI lines and the brightness of the star, both on a time scale of
months and on a time scale of years. The short-term variations are smaller and

energies up to 1 EeV, the features of muon arrival time distributions and their
correlations with other observable EAS quantities have been scrutinised on
basis of high-energy EAS, simulated with the Monte Carlo code CORSIKA and using
in general the QGSJET model as generator. Methodically various correlations of
adequately defined arrival time parameters with other EAS parameters have been
investigated by invoking non-parametric methods for the analysis of
multivariate distributions, studying the classification and misclassification
probabilities of various observable sets. It turns out that adding the arrival
time information and the multiplicity of muons spanning the observed time
distributions has distinct effects improving the mass discrimination. A further
outcome of the studies is the feature that for the considered ranges of primary
energies and of distances from the shower axis the discrimination power of
global arrival time distributions referring to the arrival time of the shower
core is only marginally enhanced as compared to local distributions referring
to the arrival of the locally first muon.

to the primary cosmic ray spectrum a steepening of the power-law falls off at
around 3-5 PeV, known as the {\em knee} has been identified. Different
experimental techniques are used to deduce mass- and energy-sensitive
observables of EAS experiments. The experiments involve measurements of
secondary particle distributions at various observation levels and of muons
deep underground as well as of observables reconstructed by measuring the air
Cherenkov light emitted with the shower development in the atmosphere. Recently
methods for analysing multidimensional distributions get favoured since they
are able to take into account the correlations between different observables
and the influence of large intrinsic fluctuations of the air-shower
development. Additionally the use of a larger set of observables provides the
possibility to test simultaneously the consistency of the Monte-Carlo models
underlying the reconstruction procedures. By many experiments the existence of
the knee in the primary energy spectrum is confirmed and a tendency of an
increasing mean mass above the knee energy is indicated. Recent results show
that the knee originates from a decrease of the flux of light primary
particles, whereas heavy cosmic ray particles seem to miss a kink in the energy
range of 1 and 10 PeV.

approximation. The specific heat is presented as a functional of the
superconducting gap on the Fermi surface. The obtained formula interpolates
between the correct low coupling jump at T_c and the low temperature behavior

the specific heat and the superconducting gap. For anisotropic superconductors,
the interpolation formula incorporates averaging of powers of the gap
anisotropy function over the Fermi surface and provides a suitable set for

formula is illustrated by (i) the Pokrovsky formula for the specific heat jump,

take into account vertex corrections due to impurity scattering calculated in
the Born approximation. The function gamma_s(H)/gamma_n increases from zero and
becomes approximately linear above H/H_{c2} \sim 0.1. The dependence on
impurity scattering is substantially reduced by the vertex corrections. The
upward curvature of kappa_{es}(H)/kappa_{en}, which is caused by decreasing
Andreev scattering for increasing field, is reduced for increasing impurity
scattering. We also calculate the temperature dependence of the scattering
rates 1/tau_{ps}(H) of a phonon and 1/tau_{es}(H) of a quasiparticle due to
quasiparticle and phonon scattering, respectively. At low temperatures the
ratio tau_{pn}/tau_{ps}(H) increases rapidly to one as H tends to H_{c2} which

evolution of structural relaxation in binary mixtures of hard spheres with size

a slight extension of the glass regime. For larger size disparity, a
plasticization effect is obtained, leading to a stabilization of the liquid due

the region $Qv_F \ll k_BT \ll \Delta_0$, (low temperature regime) where ${\bf

We explicitly evaluate these terms, for parameters appropriate to the cuprates,
for ${\bf Q}$ along the nodal and the antinodal directions and compare it with
the contribution from processes considered earlier(I.Vekhter et al {\it Phys.

(FM-superconductivity) was developed to explain in a natural way the fact that
the superconductivity in $UGe_2$, $ZrZn_2$ and $URhGe$ is confined to the
ferromagnetic phase.The order parameter is a spin anti-parallel component of a
spin-1 triplet with zero spin projection. The transverse spin fluctuations are
pair forming and the longitudinal ones are pair breaking. In the present paper,
a superconducting solution, based on the magnon exchange mechanism, is obtained
which closely matches the experiments with $ZrZn_2$ and $URhGe$. The onset of
superconductivity leads to the appearance of complicated Fermi surfaces in the
spin up and spin down momentum distribution functions. Each of them consist of
two pieces, but they are simple-connected and can be made very small by varying
the microscopic parameters. As a result, it is obtained that the specific heat
depends on the temperature linearly, at low temperature, and the coefficient
$\gamma=\frac {C}{T}$ is smaller in the superconducting phase than in the
ferromagnetic one. The absence of a quantum transition from ferromagnetism to
ferromagnetic superconductivity in a weak ferromagnets $ZrZn_2$ and $URhGe$ is
explained accounting for the contribution of magnon self-interaction to the
spin fluctuations' parameters. It is shown that in the presence of an external
magnetic field the system undergoes a first order quantum phase transition.

prove the natural generic collapse for Z-embeddable databases over any linearly
ordered context structure with arbitrary monadic predicates, and for
N-embeddable databases over the context structure (R,<,+,Mon_Q,Groups). Here,
N, Z, R, denote the sets of natural numbers, integers, and real numbers,
respectively. Groups is the collection of all subgroups of (R,+) that contain
Z, and Mon_Q is the collection of all subsets of a particular infinite subset Q
of N. Restricting the complexity of the formulas that may be used to formulate
queries to Boolean combinations of purely existential first-order formulas, we
even obtain the collapse for N-embeddable databases over any linearly ordered
context structure with arbitrary predicates. Finally, we develop the notion of
N-representable databases, which is a natural generalization of the classical
notion of finitely representable databases. We show that natural generic
collapse results for N-embeddable databases can be lifted to the larger class
of N-representable databases. To obtain, in particular, the collapse result for

intricate dynamics than their ordinary fluid counterparts. Superfluidity allows
different superfluid (and superconducting) species of particles to have
independent fluid flows, a consequence of which is that the fluid equations of
motion contain as many fluid element velocities as superfluid species. Whenever
the particles of one superfluid interact with those of another, the momentum of
each superfluid will be a linear combination of both superfluid velocities.
This leads to the so-called entrainment effect whereby the motion of one
superfluid will induce a momentum in the other superfluid. We have constructed
a fully relativistic model for entrainment between superfluid neutrons and
superconducting protons using a relativistic $\sigma - \omega$ mean field model
for the nucleons and their interactions. In this context there are two notions
of ``relativistic'': relativistic motion of the individual nucleons with
respect to a local region of the star (i.e. a fluid element containing, say, an
Avogadro's number of particles), and the motion of fluid elements with respect
to the rest of the star. While it is the case that the fluid elements will
typically maintain average speeds at a fraction of that of light, the
supranuclear densities in the core of a neutron star can make the nucleons
themselves have quite high average speeds within each fluid element. The
formalism is applied to the problem of slowly-rotating superfluid neutron star
configurations, a distinguishing characteristic being that the neutrons can
rotate at a rate different from that of the protons.

presence of the boundary terms. In particular, for natural choices of the
parameters, these fermionic couplings can be substantially suppressed compared
to those in the conventional Randall-Sundrum scenario. This results in a
significant relaxation of the bound on the lightest gauge KK mass obtained from
precision electroweak data; we demonstrate that this bound can be as low as a
few hundred GeV. Due to the relationship between the lightest gauge KK state
and the electroweak scale in this model, this weakened constraint allows for
the electroweak scale to be near a TeV in this minimal extension of the
Randall-Sundrum model with bulk gauge fields, as opposed to the conventional
scenario.

is much larger than the hadronic entropy obtained in all the RMF models. We
also find that almost all of these models present a strong entropy enhancement
in the hadronic sector coming from the baryonic phase transition to a
nucleon-antinucleon plasma. This result is in agreement with the recent data

and the evaluation of the hadronic matrix elements, i.e. the relevant hadronic

spectator contributions, etc. are discussed next. The second section we started
with non-leptonic decays, typically $B \to \pi\pi, K\pi, \rho\pi,...$ We
describe in more detail our prediction for decays dominated by the $b\to s

and gauge invariance, and due to the violation of the angular moment
conservation, generally called the Standard Model-forbiden decays. However, the
non-commutative QED and/or non-commutative Standard Model (NCSM), developed in
a series of works in the last few years allow some of those decay modes. These
are, in the gauge sector, $Z\to \gamma\gamma, gg$, and in the hadronic sector,
flavour changing decays of the type $K\to \pi \gamma$, $B\to K\gamma$, etc. We
shall see, for example, that the flavour changing decay $D^+_s\to \pi^+ \gamma$
dominates over other modes, because the processes occur via charged currents,
i.e. on the quark level it arises from the point-like photon $\times$ current
$\times$ current interactions. In the last section we present the transition
rate of ``transverse plasmon'' decay into a neutrino--antineutrino pair via
noncommutative QED, i.e. $\gamma_{\rm pl}\to \nu\bar\nu$. Such decays gives
extra contribution to the mechanism for the energy loss in stars.

Q(Ms, Gs) is the main scenario. It is then described the Sp(2) algebra for

quantize gravity. It is also more predictive than conventional quantum field
theory, one aspect of this being the way that it contributed to the emergence
of the concept of ``supersymmetry'' of particle interactions. There are hints
from the successes of supersymmetric unified theories of particle interactions
that supersymmetry is relevant to elementary particles at energies close to
current accelerator energies; if this is so, it will be confirmed
experimentally and supersymmetry is then also likely to be important in
cosmology, in connection with dark matter, baryogenesis, and/or inflation.
Magnetic monopoles play an important role in the structure of string theory,
and thus should certainly exist, if string theory is correct, though they may
have been diluted by inflation to an unobservable level. The monopole mass in
many attractive models is near the Planck mass, but, if unification of
elementary particle forces with gravity occurs near TeV energies through large
or warped extra dimensions, as in some recent models, then monopoles should be
below 100 TeV and in an astrophysical context would be ultrarelativistic. In
such models, supersymmetry would definitely be expected at TeV energies.

a hyperboloid. For the former the diagonal solution is stable, but not so for

simple rescaling of the pair $(S_D,S)$ which makes them dual variables with
$\Gamma(2)$ monodromy. We then show that, thanks to a crucial scaling property
of the free energy derived perturbatively by Dijkgraaf, Gukov, Kazakov and
Vafa, this redefinition corresponds to a rescaling of the free energy which in
turn fixes the rescaling of the coupling constant. Next, we show that in terms
of the rescaled free energy one obtains a nonperturbative relation which is the
matrix model counterpart of the relation between the $u$--modulus and the
prepotential of N=2 SYM. This suggests considering a dual formulation of the
matrix model in which the expansion of the prepotential in the strong coupling
region, whose QFT derivation is still unknown, should follow from perturbation
theory. The investigation concerns the SU(2) gauge group and can be generalized

for this work was to find an explicit formula for a ""Szego-regularized""
determinant of a zeroth order pseudodifferential operator (PsDO) on a Zoll
manifold. The idea of the Szego-regularization was suggested by V. Guillemin
and K. Okikiolu. They have computed the second term in a Szego type expansion
on a Zoll manifold of an arbitrary dimension. In the present work we compute
the third asymptotic term in any dimension. In the case of dimension 2, our
formula gives the above mentioned expression for the Szego-redularized
determinant of a zeroth order PsDO. The proof uses a new combinatorial
identity, which generalizes a formula due to G.A.Hunt and F.J.Dyson. This
identity is related to the distribution of the maximum of a random walk with
i.i.d. steps on the real line. The proof of this combinatorial identity
together with historical remarks and a discussion of probabilistic and
algebraic connections has been published separately.

the case when the matrix of the linearized system in x0 is diagonalizable. This
technique is based on the gradual extension of the ""embryo"" of an analytic
function of several complex variables. The analytic function is the transformed
of a Lyapunov function whose natural domain of analyticity is the DA and which
satisfies a linear non-homogeneous partial differential equation. The equation
permits to establish an ""embryo"" of the transformed function and a first
approximation of DA. The ""embryo"" is used for the determination of a new
""embryo"" and a new part of the DA. In this way, computing new ""embryos"" and new
domains, the DA is gradually approximated. Numerical examples are given for
polynomial systems. For systems considered recently in the literature the

systems, we illustrate a wavelet-accelerated Monte Carlo (WAMC) algorithm,
which hierarchically coarse-grains a lattice model by computing the probability
distribution for successively larger block spins. We demonstrate that although
the method perturbs the system by changing its Hamiltonian and by allowing
block spins to take on values not permitted for individual spins, the results
obtained agree with the analytical results in the preceding paper, and
``converge'' to exact results obtained in the absence of coarse-graining.
Additionally, we show that the decorrelation time for the WAMC is no worse than
that of Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC), and that scaling laws can be constructed
from data performed in several short simulations to estimate the results that
would be obtained from the original simulation. Although the algorithm is not
asymptotically faster than traditional MMC, because of its hierarchical design,
the new algorithm executes several orders of magnitude faster than a full
simulation of the original problem. Consequently, the new method allows for
rapid analysis of a phase diagram, allowing computational time to be focused on
regions near phase transitions.

as they do in the classical game, they are found to virtually cooperate due to
the quantum entanglement between them. We also find that the original
Einstein-Podolksy-Rosen state contributes to the best profits that the two
firms could ever attain. Moreover, we propose a practical experimental setup
for the implementation of such quantum games.

driving the pursuit for its practical realization by various physical
techniques. Currently Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has been the forerunner
by demonstrating a majority of quantum algorithms. In NMR, spin systems
consisting of coupled nuclear spins are utilized as qubits. In order to carry
out QIP, a spin system has to meet two major requirements: (i) qubit
addressability and (ii) mutual coupling among the qubits. It has been
demonstrated that the magnitude of the mutual coupling among qubits can be
increased by orienting the spin-systems in a liquid crystal matrix and
utilizing the residual dipolar couplings. While utilizing residual dipolar
couplings may be useful to increase the number of qubits, nuclei of same
species (homonuclei) might become strongly coupled. In strongly coupled
spin-systems, spins loose their individual identity of being qubits. We propose
that even such strongly coupled spin-systems can be used for QIP and the
qubit-manipulation can be achieved by transition-selective pulses. We
demonstrate experimental preparation of pseudopure states, creation of
maximally entangled states, implementation logic gates and implementation of
Deutsch-Jozsa (DJ) algorithm in strongly coupled 2,3 and 4 spin systems. The
energy levels of the strongly coupled 3 and 4 spin systems were obtained by
using a Z-COSY experiment.
