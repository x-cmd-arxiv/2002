<= t_P = (hbar G/c^5)^0.5 ~ 5.4E-44 s, the Planck time. If the phenomenon
exists, the energy and momentum of a photon (quantities which are independently
measured) will be subject to ultimate uncertainties of the form dE/E ~ dp/p ~
(E/E_P)^a, where E=h/t_P and a~1, because surpassing these will lead to
`super-clocks' and `super-rulers'. A well-known consequence is random
perturbation of the photon dispersion equation by a correction term which to
lowest order modifies the equation to the form p^2 = E^2[1 +/- a_o(E/E_P)^a],
where a_o ~ 1 and c=1. As a result, the two wave velocities will fluctuate by
different amounts, so that after propagating a sufficiently large distance the
phase of the radiation will no longer be well-defined. Now, at optical
frequencies, the technique of stellar interferometry readily ascertains whether
light from an astronomical object retains is phase information upon arrival.
Currently the furthest star from which interference fringes were seen, S Ser,
is at ~ 1 kpc, implying that all models with a <= 13/15 are to be rejected. The

world volume theory with heavy Nc quarks on the Nf D6 supergravity background.
After a sequence of T- and S-dualities, we obtain the (generalized) 2-forms in
the configuration with Nc D5-branes wrapping on the vanishing two-cycle under
the influence of the background. These 2-forms shows the same behavior as the
gauge coupling constant of the 4D N=2 super QCD. The background reduces to the
Z_{Nf} orbifold in the twelve-dimensional space-time formally realized by
introducing the two parameters as the additional space coordinates. The 10D
gravity dual is suggested as the 2D flip in this twelve-dimensional space-time.
In the case of Nf=2Nc, this gravity dual becomes AdS_5 \times S^5/Z_2 with
D3-charge which depends on the constant generalized NSNS 2-form. This is the
result expected from the M-theory QCD configuration. Based on the known exact
result, we also discuss this configuration after including the nonperturbative
effect.

remains unknown until it is reconstructed. Next, we propose the framework for
automatic sharing of a known secret. In this case the dealer does not know the
secret and the secret owner does not know the shares. We present opportunities
for joining ASGS with other extended capabilities, with special emphasize on

and interacting through the nonlinear effect known as ``cascading'' in
nonlinear optics.
  The perturbative method mixes a multi-scale expansion with a power series
expansion of the susceptibility, and must be carefully adapted to the physical

the model is valid: the order of magnitude of the walk-off, phase-mismatch,and

through the cavity. The atomic state gets first correlated to the photon number
parity. The wrong parity results in an atom in the upper state. The atom in
this state is then used to inject a photon in the mode via adiabatic transfer,
correcting the field parity. By solving numerically the exact master equation
