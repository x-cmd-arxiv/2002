microjansky radio sources detected in ultradeep 1.4GHz maps centered on the
Hubble Deep Field-North (HDF-N) and the Hawaii Survey Fields SSA13 and SSA22.
Our spectroscopic redshifts for 169 radio sources reveal a flat median redshift
distribution, and these sources are hosted by similarly luminous optical L*
galaxies, regardless of redshift. This is a serious concern for radio estimates
of the local star formation rate density, as a substantial fraction of the
ultraviolet luminosity density is generated by sub-L* galaxies at low
redshifts. From our submillimeter measurements for 278 radio sources, we find
error-weighted mean 850micron fluxes of 1.72$\pm$0.09 mJy for the total sample,
2.37$\pm$0.13 mJy for the optically-faint (I>23.5) subsample, and 1.04$\pm$0.13
mJy for the optically-bright (I<23.5) subsample. We significantly (>3\sigma)
detect in the submillimeter 50 of the radio sources, 38 with I>23.5.
Spectroscopic redshifts for three of the I<23.5 submillimeter-detected radio
sources are in the range z=1.0-3.4, and all show AGN signatures. Using only the
submillimeter mapped regions we find that 69\pm9% of the submillimeter-detected
radio population are at I>23.5. We also find that 66\pm7% of the S850>5 mJy
(>4\sigma) sources are radio-identified. We find that millimetric redshift
estimates at low redshifts are best made with a FIR template intermediate
between a Milky Way type galaxy and a starburst galaxy, and at high redshifts
with an Arp220 template.

with an analysis of the 87 ksec Chandra X-ray observations of GRB 021004 taken

GRB. We find an intrinsic spectral slope at optical wavelengths of beta_UH =
0.39 +/- 0.12 and an X-ray slope of beta_X = 0.94 +/- 0.03. There is no
evidence for colour evolution between 8.5 hours and 5.5 days after the burst.
The optical decay becomes steeper approximately five days after the burst. This
appears to be a gradual break due to the onset of sideways expansion in a
collimated outflow. Our data suggest that the extra-galactic extinction along
the line of sight to the burst is between A_V = 0.3 and A_V = 0.5 and has an
extinction law similar to that of the Small Magellanic Cloud. The optical and
X-ray data are consistent with a relativistic fireball with the shocked
electrons being in the slow cooling regime and having an electron index of p =
1.9 +/- 0.1. The burst occurred in an ambient medium that is homogeneous on
scales larger than approximately 10e18 cm but inhomogeneous on smaller scales.
The mean particle density is similar to what is seen for other bursts (0.1 < n
< 100 cm^{-3}). Our results support the idea that the brightening seen
approximately 0.1 days was due to interaction with a clumpy ambient medium
within 10^{17} and 10^{18} cm of the progenitor. The agreement between the
predicted optical decay and that observed approximately ten minutes after the
burst suggests that the physical mechanism controlling the observed flux
approximately ten minutes is the same as the one operating at t > 0.5 days.

important attributes of a galaxy cluster, such as velocity dispersion, mass,
radius, and X-ray temperature and luminosity. We find that the scaling
relations of these quantities with richness are entirely consistent with those
derived by assuming a simple mass density profile at 0.5 Mpc of rho~r^{-1.8}.
The excellent correlations between B_gc and velocity dispersion and X-ray
temperature allow one to use richness, an easily measurable quantity using
relatively shallow optical imaging data alone, as a predictor of these
quantities at moderate redshifts. The B_gc parameter can be used to estimate
the velocity dispersion of a cluster to a precision of approximately 15%
(~+/-100 km/s), and X-ray temperature to about 20%. Similar correlations, but
with larger scatter, are also obtained between richness and the characteristic
radius and mass of the clusters. We compare the relative merits of B_gc, T_x,
and L_x as predictors of the dynamical mass, and find that they are comparable,
providing estimates at an accuracy of ~30%. We also perform similar analyses of
correlations between richness and velocity dispersion, T_x and L_x with a

Observed mass can only account for 30% of this mass density. Recently, an
outstanding observation revealed that cosmos is accelerating. This motivated
some astronomers to explain the missing 70% as some exotic dark energy called
quintessence. In this essay, we present an alternative explanation to these

accretion disks orbiting black holes is an important issue for most models of
cosmic gamma-ray bursts. To this aim we investigate this phenomenon by means of
time-dependent, hydrodynamical simulations of black hole plus torus systems in
general relativity. The evolution of the central black hole is assumed to be
that of a sequence of Kerr black holes of increasing mass and spin, whose
growth rate is controlled by the transfer of mass and angular momentum from the
material of the disk spiralling in through the event horizon of the black hole.
The self-gravity of the disk is neglected. We find that when the black hole
mass and spin are allowed to increase, constant angular momentum disks undergo
a runaway instability on a dynamical timescale (a few orbital periods).
However, our simulations show that a slight increase of the specific angular
momentum of the disk outwards has a dramatic stabilizing effect. Our results,
obtained in the framework of general relativity, are in broad agreement with
earlier studies based both on stationary models and on time-dependent
simulations with Newtonian and pseudo-Newtonian gravitational potentials.

passbands are determined for the bright long duration GRB 021004 afterglow from
2002 October 4 to 16 starting $\sim$ 3 hours after the $\gamma-$ray burst.
Light curves of the afterglow emission in $B$,$V$,$R$ and $I$ passbands are
obtained by combining these measurements with other published data. The
earliest optical emission appears to originate in a revese shock. Flux decay of
the afterglow shows a very uncommon variation relative to other well-observed
GRBs. Rapid light variations, especially during early times ($\Delta t < 2$
days) is superposed on an underlying broken power law decay typical of a jetted
afterglow. The flux decay constants at early and late times derived from least
square fits to the light curve are $0.99\pm0.05$ and $2.0\pm0.2$ respectively,
with a jet break at around 7 day. Comparison with a standard fireball model
indicates a total extinction of $E(B-V)=0.20$ mag in the direction of the
burst. Our low-resolution spectra corrected for this extinction provide a
spectral slope $\beta = 0.6\pm0.02$. This value and the flux decay constants
agree well with the electron energy index $p\sim 2.27$ used in the model. The
derived jet opening angle of about $7^{\circ}$ implies a total emitted
gamma-ray energy $E_{\gamma} = 3.5\times10^{50}$ erg at a cosmological distance
of about 20 Gpc. Multiwavelength observations indicate association of this GRB
with a star forming region, supporting the case for collapsar origin of long

behavior of rodlike particles, using the Onsager theory of hard rods. Our aim
is to establish whether ``unusual'' effects such as isotropic-nematic-nematic
(I-N-N) phase separation can occur even for length distributions with a single
peak. We focus on the onset of I-N coexistence. For a log-normal distribution
we find that a finite upper cutoff on rod lengths is required to make this
problem well-posed. The cloud curve, which tracks the density at the onset of
I-N coexistence as a function of the width of the length distribution, exhibits
a kink; this demonstrates that the phase diagram must contain a three-phase
I-N-N region.
  Theoretical analysis shows that in the limit of large cutoff the cloud point
density actually converges to zero, so that phase separation results at any
nonzero density; this conclusion applies to all length distributions with
fatter-than-exponentail tails. Finally we consider the case of a Schulz
distribution, with its exponential tail. Surprisingly, even here the long rods
(and hence the cutoff) can dominate the phase behaviour, and a kink in the
cloud curve and I-N-N coexistence again result. Theory establishes that there
is a nonzero threshold for the width of the length distribution above which
these long rod effects occur, and shows that the cloud and shadow curves
approach nonzero limits for large cutoff, both in good agreement with the
numerical results.

framework of a minimal lattice model, we can distinguish between sequences
obeying to one or to the other mechanism on the basis of the partition of the
ground state energy between bulk than for interface contacts. The topology of
contacts is very different for the bulk than for the interface: while the bulk
displays a rich network of interactions, the dimer interface is built up a set
of essentially independent contacts. Consequently, the two sets of interactions
play very different roles both in the the folding and in the evolutionary
history of the protein. Three--state dimers, where a large fraction of the
energy is concentrated in few contacts buried in the bulk, and where the
relative contact energy of interface contacts is considerably smaller than that
associated with bulk contacts, fold according to a hierarchycal pathway
controlled by local elementary structures, as also happens in the folding of
single--domain monomeric proteins. On the other hand, two--state dimers display
a relative contact energy of interface contacts which is larger than the
corresponding quantity associated with the bulk. In this case, the assembly of
the interface stabilizes the system and lead the two chains to fold. The
specific properties of three--state dimers acquired through evolution are
expected to be more robust than those of two--state dimers, a fact which has
consequences on proteins connected with viral diseases.

for improving accuracy of automatic recognition of continuous coverbal

visual signal to learn the prior probability of co-occurrence of the prominent

found that the above co-analysis helps in detecting and disambiguating visually

  ""SPIN 2002"", Brookhaven National Laboratory",,"10.1063/1.1607118",,"hep-ph",,"  Experiment E950 at AGS, BNL has provided data with high statistics for the
left-right asymmetry of proton-carbon elastic scattering in the Coulomb-nuclear
interference region of momentum transfer. It allows to access information about
spin properties of the Pomeron and has practical implications for polarimetry
at high energies. Relying on Regge factorization the results for the parameter
r_5, ratio of spin-flip to non-flip amplitudes, is compared with the same
parameter measured earlier in pion-proton elastic and charge exchange
scattering. While data for Im r_5 agree (within large systematic errors), there
might be a problem for Re r_5. The \pi N data indicate at a rather small
contribution of the f-Reggeon to the spin-flip part of the iso-scalar amplitude
which is dominated by the Pomeron. This conclusion is supported by direct
analysis of data for elastic and charge exchange pp and pn scattering which
also indicate at a vanishing real part of the hadronic spin-flip amplitude at
energies 20 GeV and higher. This is a good news for polarimetry, since the E950
results enhanced by forthcoming new measurements at AGS can be safely used for
polarimetry at RHIC at higher energies.

data into account. Focusing on minimal supergravity models, we find that for a
large range of MSSM parameters suggested by the relic abundance of neutralino
dark matter and that is consistent with Higgs boson mass and other constraints,
these radiative decays are in the range accessible to planned experiments. We
compare these predictions with lepton flavor violation in the second class of
models arising entirely from the Dirac Yukawa couplings. We study the
dependence of the ratio r \equiv B(\mu -> e+\gamma)/B(\tau ->\mu +\gamma) on
the MSSM parameters and show that measurement of r can provide crucial insight

Hermitean metric in the embedding space and it is found that this can be

supermultiplet explaining a recently discovered degeneracy of anomalous
dimensions on the sphere and torus. The lowest dimensional component is an
operator of naive dimension J+2 transforming in the [0,J,0] representation of

the point view of vacuum pairs, considered as ground states of a
Yang-Mills-Higgs gauge theory. We treat a vacuum as a section in an appropriate
bundle that is naturally associated with a minimum of a (general) Higgs
potential. Such a vacuum spontaneously breaks the underlying gauge symmetry if
the invariance group of the vacuum is a proper subgroup of the gauge group. We
show that each choice of a vacuum admits to geometrically interpret the bosonic
mass matrices as ``normal'' sections. The spectrum of these sections turns out
to be constant over the manifold and independent of the chosen vacuum. Since
the mass matrices commute with the invariance group of the chosen vacuum one
may decompose the Hermitian vector bundles which correspond to the bosons in
the eigenbundles of the bosonic mass matrices. This decomposition is the
geometrical analogue of the physical notion of a ``particle multplet''. In this
sense the basic notion of a ``free particle'' also makes sense within the
geometrical context of a gauge theory, provided the gauge symmetry is
spontaneously broken by some vacuum.
  We also discuss the Higgs-Kibble mechanism (``Higgs Dinner'') from a
geometrical point of view. It turns out that the ``unitary gauge'', usually
encountered in the context of discussing the Higgs Dinner, is of purely
geometrical origin. In particular, we discuss rotationally symmetric Higgs
potentials and give a necessary and sufficient condition for the unitary gauge
to exist. As a specific example we discuss in some detail the electroweak
sector of the standard model of particle physics in this context.

degeneration of Calabi-Yau manifolds, which we call toric degenerations. For
these, the degenerate fibre is a union of toric varieties meeting along toric
strata. In addition, the total space must look locally toric outside of some
singular set. This is a generalisation of both Mumford-type degenerations of
abelian varieties and degenerations of Calabi-Yau hypersurfacesin toric
varieties. From such a degeneration, we construct a dual intersection graph
along with a singular affine structure. We also explain how to reverse this
procedure, using logarithmic structures. We then use a discrete Legendre
transform on these affine manifolds to recover mirror symmetry. Finally, we
discuss the relationship between this construction and more classical forms of

extensions are provided and improvements are given for some aspects. Stability
by tensor products, convolution, and bounded perturbations are addressed. We
show that under simple convexity assumptions on Phi, such inequalities hold in
a lot of situations, including hyper-contractive diffusions, uniformly strictly
log-concave measures, Wiener measure (paths space of Brownian Motion on

separation of activation and deactivation processes that potentially results in
precipitous gradients of activated proteins. The classical Metabolic Control
Analysis (MCA), which quantifies the influence of an individual process on a
system variable as the control coefficient, cannot be applied to spatially
separated protein networks. The present paper unravels the principles that
govern the control over the fluxes and intermediate concentrations in spatially
heterogeneous reaction networks. Our main results are two types of the control
summation theorems. The first type is a non-trivial generalization of the
classical theorems to systems with spatially and temporally varying
concentrations. In this generalization, the process of diffusion, which enters
as the result of spatial concentration gradients, plays a role similar to other
processes such as chemical reactions and membrane transport. The second
summation theorem is completely novel. It states that the control by the
membrane transport, the diffusion control coefficient multiplied by two, and a
newly introduced control coefficient associated with changes in the spatial
size of a system (e.g., cell), all add up to one and zero for the control over
flux and concentration. Using a simple example of a kinase/phosphatase system
in a spherical cell, we speculate that unless active mechanisms of
intracellular transport are involved, the threshold cell size is limited by the
diffusion control, when it is beginning to exceed the spatial control
coefficient significantly.

holomorphic submersion of X to C^q. It follows that every complex subbundle E
in the tangent bundle TX with trivial quotient bundle TX/E is homotopic to the
tangent bundle of a holomorphic foliation of X. If X is parallelizable, it
admits a submersion to C^{n-1} and nonsingular holomorphic foliations of any

spectroscopy of odd nuclei in terms of the properties of neighboring even
nuclei and of single-particle properties, that are the input parameters of the

corresponding formalism for odd-odd nuclei that relates their properties to
those of four neighboring even nuclei, all of which enter if one is to include
both multipole and pairing forces. We treat these equations in two ways. In the

by operating on Fermi-gas states by a symmetrized product of pair correlation
operators determined from variational calculations with the Argonne v18 and
Urbana IX two- and three-nucleon interactions. The squares of the charge
current matrix elements are found to be quenched by 20 to 25 % by the
short-range correlations in nucleon matter. Most of the quenching is due to
spin-isospin correlations induced by the pion exchange interactions which
change the isospins and spins of the nucleons. A large part of it can be
related to the probability for a spin up proton quasi-particle to be a bare
spin up/down proton/neutron. We also calculate the matrix elements of the
nuclear Hamiltonian in the same correlated basis. These provide relatively mild
effective interactions which give the variational energies in the Hartree-Fock
approximation. The calculated two-nucleon effective interaction describes the
spin-isospin susceptibilities of nuclear and neutron matter fairly accurately.
However $\geq$ 3-body terms are necessary to reproduce the compressibility. All

are the main motivation for developing a polarized rf gun. However there are
both technical and physics issues in generating highly polarized electron beams
using rf guns that remain to be resolved. The PWT design offers promising
features that may facilitate solutions to technical problems such as field
emission and poor vacuum. Physics issues such as emission time now seem to be
satisfactorily resolved. Other issues, such as the effect of magnetic fields at
the cathode-both those associated with the rf field and those imposed by
schemes to produce flat beams-are still open questions. Potential solution of
remaining problems will be discussed in the context of the PWT design.

being determined by shared classical randomness. In the first part of this
paper, we propose a simple game for n players demonstrating this non-local
property of quantum mechanics: While, on the one hand, it is immediately clear
that classical players will lose the game with substantial probability, it can,
on the other hand, always be won by players sharing an entangled quantum state.
The simplicity of the classical analysis of our game contrasts the often quite
involved analysis of previously proposed examples of this type.
  In the second part, aiming at a quantitative characterization of the
non-locality of n-partite quantum states, we consider a general class of
n-player games, where the amount of communication between certain (randomly
chosen) groups of players is measured. Comparing the classical communication
needed for both classical players and quantum players (initially sharing a
given quantum state) to win such a game, a new type of separation results is
obtained. In particular, we show that in order to simulate two separated qubits
of an n-partite GHZ state at least (roughly) log(log(n)) bits of information
are required.

introduce a concept of an entangled structure (graph) such that each qubit of a
multipartite system is associated with a point (vertex) while a bi-partite
entanglement between two specific qubits is represented by a connection (edge)
between these points. We prove that any such entangled structure can be
associated with a pure state of a multi-qubit system. Moreover, we show that a
pure state corresponding to a given entangled structure is a superposition of
vectors from a subspace of the $2^N$-dimensional Hilbert space, whose dimension
grows linearly with the number of entangled pairs.

universally valid and query whether classical physics is really intuitive and

quantum mechanics where the classical ontology is relaxed by reducing
metaphysical hypotheses. On the basis of this weak ontology a formal logic of
quantum physics can be established which is given by an orthomodular lattice.
By means of the Soler condition and Piron's result one obtains the classical
Hilbert spaces. - However, this approach is not fully convincing. There is no
plausible justification of Soler's law and the quantum ontology is partly too
weak and partly too strong. We propose to replace this ontology by an ontology
of unsharp properties and conclude that quantum mechanics is more intuitive
than classical mechanics and that classical mechanics is not the macroscopic
limit of quantum mechanics.

considerations provide us with a qualitative difference between the W state and
GHZ state in the situation when they are separately sent via depolarizing

the GHZ states cannot produce a distillable state between two qubits, whereas
the W states can still produce a distillable state in a similar situation.

in that two different problems have been mixed: the problem of Pauli (being
more general and more important) and non-unitarity of exponential phase
