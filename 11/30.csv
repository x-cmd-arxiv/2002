ground state of hadronic matter for a much wider range of the parameters of the

equation of state (EOS) of CFL strange matter and study the structure of
stellar objects made up of this phase, highlighting the novel features of the
latter. Although the effects of pairing on the equation of state are thought to
be small, we find that CFL stars may be in fact much more compact than strange

  Letters","Astrophys.J.585:L1-L4,2003","10.1086/374208",,"astro-ph",,"  Threshold biasing of a Gaussian random field gives a linear amplification of
the reduced two point correlation function at large distances. We show that for
standard cosmological models this does not translate into a linear
amplification of the power spectrum (PS) at small k. For standard CDM type
models this means that the``turn-over'' at small k of the original PS
disappears in the PS of the biased field for the physically relevant range of
the threshold parameter. In real space this difference is manifest in the
asymptotic behaviour of the normalised mass variance in spheres of radius R,
which changes from the ``super-homogeneous'' behaviour to a Poisson-like
behaviour.This qualitative change results from the intrinsic stochasticity of
the threshold sampling. While our quantitative results are specific to the
simplest threshold biasing model, we argue that our qualitative conclusions
should be valid generically for any biasing mechanism involving a
scale-dependent amplification of the correlation function. One implication is
that the real-space correlation function will be a better instrument to probe
for the underlying Harrison Zeldovich spectrum in the distribution of visible
matter, as the characteristic asymptotic negative power-law \xi (r) \sim
-r^{-4} tail is undistorted by biasing.

is achieved by the integration of the governing set of differential equations,
established from a few reasonable assumptions that account for the distinct

in such accretion episodes, the fall of matter onto the black hole is achieved

scenario proposed earlier called CPX, which has been designed to showcase the
effects of CP violation in the MSSM, and on several variant benchmarks. In most
of the CPX parameter space, these hadron colliders will find one of the neutral
MSSM Higgs bosons. However, there are small regions of parameter space in which
none of the neutral Higgs bosons can be detected in the standard channels at
the Tevatron and the LHC. This occurs because the neutral Higgs boson with the
largest coupling to W and Z bosons decays predominantly into either two lighter
Higgs bosons or a Higgs boson and a gauge boson, whilst the lighter Higgs boson
has only small couplings to the W and Z bosons and the top quark. For other
choices of CP-violating parameters, all three neutral Higgs bosons can have
significant couplings to W and Z bosons, producing overlapping signatures:
these may or may not be distinguishable from backgrounds. The existence of
these regions of parameters provides a strong motivation for a detailed

a power of the light-cone time u. We show that: (i) This spacetime is a
Lorentzian homogeneous space. In particular, like Minkowski space, it admits a
boost isometry in u,v. (ii) It is an exact solution of string theory when
supplemented by a u-dependent dilaton such that its exponent (i.e. effective
string coupling) goes to zero at u=infinity and at the singularity u=0,
reducing back-reaction effects. (iii) The classical string equations in this
background become linear in the light-cone gauge and can be solved explicitly
in terms of Bessel's functions; thus the string model can be directly
quantized. This allows one to address the issue of singularity at the
string-theory level. We examine the propagation of first-quantized
point-particle and string modes in this time-dependent background. Using

consider three special families of metrics with this property: metrics with
conical defects, Aichelburg-Sexl type metrics generated by rotating particles,
and metrics generated by giant gravitons. We find that the first two of these
are special cases of the complete family of chiral primary metrics which can be
written down using the general solution in hep-th/0109154, but they correspond
to two extreme limits - the conical defect metrics map to CFT states generated
by twist operators that are all identical, while the Aichelburg-Sexl metrics
yield a wide dispersion in the orders of these twists. The giant graviton
solutions in contrast do not represent configurations of the D1-D5 bound state;
they correspond to fragmenting this system into two or more pieces. We look at
the large distance behavior of the supergravity fields and observe that the
excitation of these fields is linked to the existence of dispersion in the
orders and spins of the twist operators creating the chiral primary in the CFT.

biological population $N(x,t)$ is derived from a hierarchical random deposition
process previously studied in statistical physics. Two biologically relevant
parameters, the probabilities of birth, $B$, and of death, $D$, determine the
carrying capacity $K$. Due to the randomness the population depends strongly on
position, $x$, and there is a distribution of carrying capacities, $\Pi (K)$.
This distribution has self-similar character owing to the imposed hierarchy.
The most probable carrying capacity and its probability are studied as a
function of $B$ and $D$. The effective growth rate decreases with time, roughly
as in a Verhulst process. The model is possibly applicable, for example, to
bacteria forming a ""towering pillar"" biofilm. The bacteria divide on randomly
distributed nutrient-rich regions and are exposed to random local bactericidal
agent (antibiotic spray). A gradual overall temperature change away from
optimal growth conditions, for instance, reduces bacterial reproduction, while
biofilm development degrades antimicrobial susceptibility, causing stagnation
into a stationary state.

quantum algorithms which achieve exponential advantage over classical
computation and lies at the heart of the solution to the abelian hidden
subgroup problem, of which Shor's celebrated factoring and discrete log
algorithms are a special case. We begin by addressing various computational
issues surrounding the QFT and give improved parallel circuits for both the QFT
over a power of 2 and the QFT over an arbitrary cyclic group. These circuits
are based on new insight into the relationship between the discrete Fourier
transform over different cyclic groups. We then exploit this insight to extend
the class of hidden subgroup problems with efficient quantum solutions. First
we relax the condition that the underlying hidden subgroup function be distinct
on distinct cosets of the subgroup in question and show that this relaxation
can be solved whenever G is a finitely-generated abelian group. We then extend
this reasoning to the hidden cyclic subgroup problem over the reals, showing
how to efficiently generate the bits of the period of any sufficiently
piecewise-continuous function on R. Finally, we show that this problem of
period-finding over R, viewed as an oracle promise problem, is strictly harder
than its integral counterpart. In particular, period-finding over R lies
outside the complexity class MA, a class which contains period-finding over the
integers.
