cluster candidates around the Sa galaxy M104 (NGC4594). Fifty-seven candidates
out to ~ 40 kpc in the halo of the galaxy were confirmed to be bona-fide
globular clusters, 27 of which are new. A first analysis of the velocities
provides only marginal evidence for rotation of the cluster system. From Hbeta
line strengths, almost all of the clusters in our sample have ages that are
consistent, within the errors, with Milky Way globular clusters. Only a few
clusters may be 1-2 Gyr old, and bulge and halo clusters appear coeval. The
absorption line indices follow the correlations established for the Milky Way
clusters. Metallicities are derived based upon new empirical calibrations with
Galactic globular clusters taking into account the non-linear behavior of some
indices (e.g., Mg2). Our sample of globular clusters in NGC4594 spans a
metallicity range of -2.13 < [Fe/H] < +0.26 dex, and the median metallicity of
the system is [Fe/H] = -0.85. Thus, our data provide evidence that some of the
clusters have super-solar metallicity. Overall, the abundance distribution of
the cluster system is consistent with a bimodal distribution with peaks at
[Fe/H] ~- 1.7 and -0.7. However, the radial change in the metallicity
distribution of clusters may not be straightforwardly explained by a varying
mixture of two sub-populations of red and blue clusters.

dwarf GD 358, based on time-resolved optical spectrophotometry. We identify 5
real pulsation modes and at least 6 combination modes at frequencies consistent
with those found in previous observations. The measured Doppler shifts from our
spectra show variations with amplitudes of up to 5.5 km/s at the frequencies
inferred from the flux variations. We conclude that these are variations in the
line-of-sight velocities associated with the pulsational motion. We use the
observed flux and velocity amplitudes and phases to test theoretical
predictions within the convective driving framework, and compare these with
similar observations of the hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf pulsators (DAVs).
The wavelength dependence of the fractional pulsation amplitudes (chromatic
amplitudes) allows us to conclude that all five real modes share the same
spherical degree, most likely, l=1. This is consistent with previous
identifications based solely on photometry. We find that a high signal-to-noise
mean spectrum on its own is not enough to determine the atmospheric parameters
and that there are small but significant discrepancies between the observations
and model atmospheres. The source of these remains to be identified. While we
infer T_eff=24kK and log g~8.0 from the mean spectrum, the chromatic
amplitudes, which are a measure of the derivative of the flux with respect to
the temperature, unambiguously favour a higher effective temperature, 27kK,
which is more in line with independent determinations from ultra-violet
spectra.

extremely steep spectral slopes below the $EF_{E}$ peak) by applying different
tests. These bursts, detected by the Burst And Transient Source Experiment

allow time resolved spectral studies on time intervals of the order of tenths
of a second. We discuss the hard spectra of these bursts and their evolution in
the context of several non--thermal emission models, which all appear
inadequate to account for these cases. The extremely hard spectra, which are
detected in the early part of the BATSE light curve, are also compared with a
black body spectral model: the resulting fits are remarkably good, except for
an excess at high energies (in several cases) which could be simply accounted
for by the presence of a supra--thermal component. The findings on the possible
thermal character of the evolving spectrum and the implications on the GRB
physical scenario are considered in the frameworks of photospheric models for a
fireball which is becoming optically thin, and of Compton drag models, in which
the fireball boosts ""ambient"" seed photons by its own bulk motion. Both models,
according to simple estimates, appear to be qualitatively and quantitatively

magnitude with accuracies of $\pm$ 0.38 mag. for a sample covering a large

  The colour term included in a previous paper has been dropped since its
inclusion was not bringing any significant improvement to the calibration. The
variation of the OI 7774 feature in the classical cepheid SS Sct has been
studied. We calculated a phase-dependent correction to random phase OI feature
strengths in Cepheids, such that it predicts mean absolute magnitudes using the

  The standard error of the calibration using the composite sample was
comparable to that obtained from the primary 27 calibrators, showing that it is
possible to calculate mean Cepheid luminosities from random phase observations

in this paper with new images from the Hubble Space Telescope's WFPC2, together
with ground-based optical and near-IR imaging, and a Fabry-Perot H-alpha
velocity field. The data provide new information on the disk/bulge/halo mix,
rotation curve, star formation in the galaxy, and the sense of winding of its
prominent spiral arms. Previously, we suggested that the weaker, inner single
arm most likely has the leading sense, based on a numerical simulation. Now,
taking advantage of HST resolution and using de Vaucouleurs' standard
extinction and reddening technique to determine the near side of the galaxy's
slightly tilted disk, we come to the more surprising conclusion that the two
strong outer arms have the leading sense. We suggest that this highly unusual
configuration may be the result of a past minor merger or mild tidal encounter.
Possible evidence for a minor merger is found in a short, central dust lane,
although this is purely circumstantial and an unrelated interaction with a
different companion could also be relevant. The leading arms may be allowed to
persist because NGC 4622 is dark halo-dominated (i.e., not ``maximum disk'' in
the inner regions) and displays a significantly rising rotation curve. The new
HST observations also reveal a rich globular cluster system in the galaxy. The
mean color of these clusters is <(V-I)o> = 1.04 and the specific frequency is
3.4$\pm$0.6. The luminosity function of these clusters confirms the membership

field strips stars from the outskirts of the star cluster. Under an assumption
that the star cluster undergoes a self-similar evolution, we obtain the
condition and timescale for the star cluster to reach the galaxy center before
its disruption. The result is used to discuss the fate of so-called
intermediate-mass black holes with >10^3 M(sun) found recently in young star
clusters of starburst galaxies and also the mass function of globular clusters
in galaxies.

frequencies is at higher (> 10 GHz) frequencies completely over-compensated by
the thermal SZ decrement. Thus, the total radio emission of a galaxy cluster
goes through zero (in comparison to the constant cosmic microwave background

has a narrow radial profile compared to the SZ decrement, a central emission
region is surrounded by a decrement within the intermediate frequency range of
several GHz. The size of this emission regions shrinks with increasing
frequency until the decrement dominates everywhere in the cluster.

behaviour of linearly polarised emission during the afterglow phase seems very
promising, since the degree and temporal dependence are predicted to be very
different from model to model. In addition, polarization measurements and
detections are accumulating fast enouqgh to lead soon to a comprehension of

Velocity profiles in both systems clearly show the presence of wall slip. We
investigate the evolution of slip velocities as a function of shear stress and
discuss the validity of the corrections for wall slip classically used in
rheology. Focussing on the bulk flow, we show that the dilute system is
Newtonian and that the concentrated emulsion is shear-thinning. In the latter
case, the curvature of the velocity profiles is compatible with a
shear-thinning exponent of 0.4 consistent with global rheological data.
However, even if individual profiles can be accounted for by a power-law fluid
(with or without a yield stress), we could not find a fixed set of parameters
that would fit the whole range of applied shear rates. Our data thus raise the
question of the definition of a global flow curve for such a concentrated
system. These results show that local measurements are a crucial complement to
standard rheological tools. They are discussed in light of recent works on soft
glassy materials.

simplicity. In this approximation, we derive a two-dimensional lens equation

in the strong field limit. The most outstanding effect is the generation of a
non trivial caustic structure. Caustics drift away from the optical axis and
acquire finite extension. For a high enough black hole spin, depending on the
source extension, we can practically observe only one image rather than two
infinite series of relativistic images. In this regime, additional non
equatorial images may play an important role in the phenomenology.

standard model with universal strength of Yukawa couplings. In these models we
find a small amount of CP violation from the usual CKM mechanism and therefore
a significant contribution from supersymmetry is required. The electric dipole
moments impose severe constraints on the parameter space, forcing the trilinear
couplings to be factorizable in matrix form. We find that the LL mass
insertions give the dominant gluino contribution to saturate epsilon_K, while
chargino contributions to epsilon'/epsilon are compatible with the experimental
results. Due to significant supersymmetric contributions to B_d-\bar{B}_d
mixing, the recent large value of a_{J/\psi K_S} can be accommodated.

generalized by introducing couplings of mesons to derivatives of the nucleon

of a state-dependent in-medium interaction in the mean-field approximation.
Various parametrizations for the generalized couplings are developed and
applied to infinite nuclear matter. In this approach, scalar and vector
self-energies depend on both density and momentum similarly as in the
Dirac-Brueckner theory. The Schr\""{o}diger-equivalent optical potential is much
less repulsive at high nucleon energies as compared to standard relativistic
mean field models and thus agrees better with experimental findings. The
derivative couplings in the extended model have significant effects on
properties of symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter.

different physical dimensions, the capacitor experiences a net force toward the
smaller electrode (Biefeld-Brown effect). We have verified this effect by
building four capacitors of different shapes. The effect may have applications
to vehicle propulsion and dielectric pumps. We review the history of this
effect briefly through the history of patents by Thomas Townsend Brown. At
present, the physical basis for the Biefeld-Brown effect is not understood. The
order of magnitude of the net force on the asymmetric capacitor is estimated
assuming two different mechanisms of charge conduction between its electrodes:
ballistic ionic wind and ionic drift. The calculations indicate that ionic wind
is at least three orders of magnitude too small to explain the magnitude of the
observed force on the capacitor. The ionic drift transport assumption leads to
the correct order of magnitude for the force, however, it is difficult to see
how ionic drift enters into the theory. Finally, we present a detailed
thermodynamic treatment of the net force on an asymmetric capacitor. In the
future, to understand this effect, a detailed theoretical model must be
constructed that takes into account plasma effects: ionization of gas (or air)
in the high electric field region, charge transport, and resulting dynamic
forces on the electrodes. The next series of experiments should determine
whether the effect occurs in vacuum, and a careful study should be carried out
to determine the dependence of the observed force on gas pressure, gas species
and applied voltage.

the dynamical equations are valid, it is incorrect to drop the quadratic terms

alternate formulation of the problem by transforming the dynamical equations to

amongst the three contributions can, not only enhance the third-order

proved that for nondissipative media with temperature independent dielectric
permittivity the energy at nonzero temperature comprises of the (renormalized)
energies of the zero-point and thermal photons. In this manner photons can be
considered as collective elementary excitations of the matter of plates and
electromagnetic field. If the dielectric permittivity depends on temperature
the energy contains additional terms proportional to the derivatives of
dielectric permittivity with respect to temperature, and the quasiparticle
interpretation of the fluctuating field is not possible. The correlation
between energy and free energy is considered. Previous calculations of the
Casimir energy in the framework of the Lifshitz formula at zero temperature and
optical tabulated data supplemented by the Drude model at room temperature are
analysed. It is demonstrated that this quantity is not a good approximation
either for the free energy or the energy. A physical interpretation of this
hybrid quantity is suggested. The contradictory results in the recent
literature on whether the zero-frequency term of the Lifshitz formula for the
perpendicular polarized modes has any effective contribution to the physical
quantities are discussed. Four main approaches to the resolution of this
problem are specified. The precise expressions for entropy of the fluctuating
field between plates made of real metal are obtained, which helps to decide
between the different approaches. The conclusion is that the Lifshitz formula
supplemented by the plasma model and the surface impedance approach are best
suited to describe the thermal Casimir force between real metals.

quantum mechanical model. The reason for interest in language is that language
expressions can have meaning, either as an informal language or as a formal
language associated with a mathematical or physical theory. It is noted that
any universally applicable physical theory, or coherent theory of physics and
mathematics together, includes in its domain physical models of expressons for
both the informal language used to discuss the theory and expressions of the
theory itself. It follows that there must be formulas in the formal theory that
express some of their own physical properties. Inclusion of intelligent system
in the theory domain means that the theory, e.g., quantum mechanics, must
describe in some sense its own validation. Maps of language expressions into

implement an arbitrary given quantum computation, in the special case of two
qubits. We pursue circuits without ancilla qubits and as small a number of
elementary quantum gates as possible. Our lower bound for worst-case optimal
two-qubit circuits calls for at least 17 gates: 15 one-qubit rotations and 2
CNOTs. To this end, we constructively prove a worst-case upper bound of 23
elementary gates, of which at most 4 (CNOT) entail multi-qubit interactions.
Our analysis shows that synthesis algorithms suggested in previous work,
although more general, entail much larger quantum circuits than ours in the
special case of two qubits. One such algorithm has a worst case of 61 gates of
which 18 may be CNOTs. Our techniques rely on the KAK decomposition from Lie
theory as well as the polar and spectral (symmetric Shur) matrix decompositions
from numerical analysis and operator theory. They are related to the canonical
decomposition of a two-qubit gate with respect to the ``magic basis'' of
phase-shifted Bell states, published previously. We further extend this
decomposition in terms of elementary gates for quantum computation.
