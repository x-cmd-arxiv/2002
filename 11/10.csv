Hobby-Eberly telescope starting 15.48, 20.31 hours, and 4.84 days after the
burst and a spectrum obtained with the H. J. Smith 2.7 m Telescope starting
14.31 hours after the burst. GRB021004 is the first afterglow whose spectrum is
dominated by absorption lines from high ionization species with multiple
velocity components separated by up to 3000 km/s. We argue that these lines are
likely to come from shells around a massive progenitor star. The high
velocities and high ionizations arise from a combination of acceleration and
flash-ionization by the burst photons and the wind velocity and steady
ionization by the progenitor. We also analyze the broad-band spectrum and the
light curve. We distinguish six components along the line of sight: (1) The
z~2.293 absorption lines arise from the wind of a massive star. For a mass loss
rate of ~6 x 10^{-5} solar masses per year, this component also provides the
external medium to create the afterglow light. (2) A second shell produces
absorption lines with a relative velocity of 560 km/s, and this is associated
with the shell created by the fast massive star wind blowing a bubble in the
preceding slow wind at a radial distance of order 10 pc. (3) More distant
clouds within the host galaxy lie between 30-2500 pc, where they have been
ionized by the burst. (4-6) The massive star wind has clumps with radii and
over-densities of 0.022, 0.063, and 0.12 parsecs and 50%, 10%, and 10%
respectively. The immediate progenitor of the burster could either be a WC-type
Wolf-Rayet star or a highly evolved star whose original mass was just too small
for it to become a WN-type Wolf-Rayet star.

porous media: random packs of mono-sized glass beads, and focus on three
specific areas peculiar to gas-phase diffusion. These topics are: (i) diffusion
of spins on the order of the pore dimensions during the application of the
diffusion encoding gradient pulses in a PGSE experiment (breakdown of the
'narrow pulse approximation' and imperfect background gradient cancellation),
(ii) the ability to derive long-length scale structural information, and (iii)
effects of finite sample size. We find that the time-dependent diffusion
coefficient, D(t), of the imbibed xenon gas at short diffusion times in small
beads is significantly affected by the gas pressure. In particular, as
expected, we find smaller deviations between measured D(t) and theoretical
predictions as the gas pressure is increased, resulting from reduced diffusion
during the application of the gradient pulse. The deviations are then
completely removed when water D(t) is observed in the same samples. The use of
gas also allows us to probe D(t) over a wide range of length scales, and
observe the long-time asymptotic limit which is proportional to the inverse
tortuosity of the sample, as well as the diffusion distance where this limit
takes effect (~ 1 - 1.5 bead diameters). The Pade approximation can be used as
a reference for expected xenon D(t) data between the short and long time
limits, allowing us to explore deviations from the expected behaviour at
intermediate times as a result of finite sample size effects. Finally, the
application of the Pade interpolation between the long and short time
asymptotic limits yields a fitted length scale (the ""Pade length""), which is
found to be ~ 0.13b for all bead packs, where b is the bead diameter.

structure over length scales of ~ 100 - 2000 micron by using the spin 1/2 noble
gas 129Xe imbibed into the system's pore space. Such length scales are much
greater than can be probed with NMR diffusion studies of water-saturated porous
media. We utilized Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo NMR measurements of the
time-dependent diffusion coefficient, D(t) of the xenon gas filling the pore
space to study further the measurements of both the surface area-pore volume
ratio, S/Vp, and the tortuosity (pore connectivity) of the medium. In
uniform-size glass bead packs, we observed D(t) decreasing with increasing t,
reaching an observed asymptote of ~ 0.62 - 0.65D0, that could be measured over
diffusion distances extending over multiple bead diameters. Measurements of
D(t)/D0 at differing gas pressures showed this tortuosity limit was not
affected by changing the characteristic diffusion length of the spins during
the diffusion encoding gradient pulse. This was not the case at the short time
limit, where D(t)/D0 was noticeably affected by the gas pressure in the sample.
Increasing the gas pressure, and hence reducing D0 and the diffusion during the
gradient pulse served to reduce the previously observed deviation of D(t)/D0
from the S/Vp relation. The Pade approximation is used to interpolate between
the long and short time limits in D(t). While the short time D(t) point lay
above the interpolation line in the case of small beads, due to diffusion
during the gradient pulse on the order of the pore size, it was also noted that
the experimental D(t) data fell below the Pade line in the case of large beads,
most likely due to finite size effects.

Its main goal is to explain why it is critically important for both neural

be easier to develop an adequate computational model for the whole
""unprogrammed"" (untrained) human brain than to find adequate formal
representations of some nontrivial parts of brain's performance. (In the same
way as, for example, it is easier to describe the behavior of a complex
analytical function than the behavior of its real and/or imaginary part.) The
""curse of dimensionality"" that plagues purely phenomenological (""brainless"")
cognitive theories is a natural penalty for an attempt to represent
insufficiently large parts of brain's performance in a state space of
insufficiently high dimensionality. A ""partial"" modeler encounters ""Catch 22.""

duality relations between special boundary operators of these two problems.

mechanism is similar to the way the Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential
arises from the matrix model measure.

  http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~slc/wpapers/s45fiedler.html",,,"math.CO cs.SC math.DG",,"  Symmetry properties of r-times covariant tensors T can be described by
certain linear subspaces W of the group ring K[S_r] of a symmetric group S_r.
If for a class of tensors T such a W is known, the elements of the orthogonal
subspace W^{\bot} of W within the dual space of K[S_r] yield linear identities
needed for a treatment of the term combination problem for the coordinates of
the T. We give the structure of these W for every situation which appears in
symbolic tensor calculations by computer. Characterizing idempotents of such W
can be determined by means of an ideal decomposition algorithm which works in
every semisimple ring up to an isomorphism. Furthermore, we use tools such as
the Littlewood-Richardson rule, plethysms and discrete Fourier transforms for
S_r to increase the efficience of calculations. All described methods were
implemented in a Mathematica package called PERMS.

$Orb_{\phi}(u)$, where $u$ is an element of the group $F_n$, under the action
of an automorphism $\phi$. If an orbit like that is finite, we determine
precisely what its cardinality can be if $u$ runs through the whole group
$F_n$, and $\phi$ runs through the whole group $Aut(F_n)$.
  Another problem that we address here is related to Whitehead's algorithm that
determines whether or not a given element of a free group of finite rank is an
automorphic image of another given element. It is known that the first part of
this algorithm (reducing a given free word to a free word of minimum possible
length by elementary Whitehead automorphisms) is fast (of quadratic time with
respect to the length of the word). On the other hand, the second part of the
algorithm (applied to two words of the same minimum length) was always
considered very slow. We give here an improved algorithm for the second part,
and we believe this algorithm always terminates in polynomial time with respect
to the length of the words. We prove that this is indeed the case if the free
group has rank 2.

isotropic grid turbulence at relatively high Reynolds numbers, Re(lambda) =
110-330. Using a conditional averaging technique, we extract typical
intermittency patterns, which are consistent with velocity profiles of a model
for a vortex tube, i.e., Burgers vortex. The radii of the vortex tubes are
several of the Kolmogorov length regardless of the Reynolds number. Using the
distribution of an interval between successive enhancements of a small-scale
velocity increment, we study the spatial distribution of vortex tubes. The
vortex tubes tend to cluster together. This tendency is increasingly
significant with the Reynolds number. Using statistics of velocity increments,
we also study the energetical importance of vortex tubes as a function of the
scale. The vortex tubes are important over the background flow at small scales
especially below the Taylor microscale. At a fixed scale, the importance is
increasingly significant with the Reynolds number.

is obtained by using Wootters's basis. It is shown that the average concurrence
of the decomposition is equal to the concurrence of the state. It is also shown
that all the entanglement content of the state is concentrated in the
Wootters's state $|x_1>$ associated with the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of
the Hermitian matrix $\sqrt{\sqrt{\rho}\tilde{\rho}\sqrt{\rho}}$ >. It is shown
that a given density matrix $\rho$ with corresponding set of positive numbers
$\lambda_i$ and Wootters's basis can transforms under $SO(4,c)$ into a generic
$2\times2$ matrix with the same set of positive numbers but with new Wootters's
basis, where the local unitary transformations correspond to $SO(4,r)$
transformations, hence, $\rho$ can be represented as coset space
$SO(4,c)/SO(4,r)$ together with positive numbers $\lambda_i$. By giving an
explicit parameterization we characterize a generic orbit of group of local
unitary transformations.

lower bound can be applied easily to low rank bipartite mixed states. From this
lower bound it is known that generic low rank bipartite mixed states have
relatively high Schmidt numbers and thus entangled. We can compute Schmidt
numbers exactly for some mixed states by this lower bound as shown in Examples.
This lower bound can also be used effectively to determine that some mixed
states cannot be convertible to other mixed states by local operations and
classical communication.
  The results in this paper are proved by ONLY using linear algebra, thus the
results and proof are easy to understand.
