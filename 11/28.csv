NGC5044 in the center of a galaxy group are presented. The line dominated soft
X-ray spectra (mainly Fe-L and O VIII Ly_a) from the diffuse gas are resolved
for the first time in this system with the Reflection Grating Spectrometers
on-board XMM-Newton and provide a strong constraint on the temperature
structure. The spectra integrated over 2' (\sim 20kpc) in full-width can be
described by a two temperature plasma model of 0.7keV and 1.1keV. Most of the
latter component is consistent with originating from off-center regions.
Compared to the isobaric cooling flow prediction, the observation shows a clear
cut-off below a temperature of 0.6 +-0.1keV. Furthermore, the Fe and O
abundances within the central 10--20kpc in radius are accurately measured to be
0.55+-0.05 and 0.25+-0.1 times the solar ratios, respectively. The observed
cut-off temperature of this galaxy and other central galaxies in galaxy groups
and clusters are compared with the scale of the galaxy and properties of the
surrounding intra-cluster medium. Based on this comparison, the origin of the
lack of predicted cool emission is discussed.

addressed the propagation of an initially laminar thermonuclear flame in
presence of a magnetic field assumed to be dipolar. We were able to show that,
within the framework of a fractal model for the flame velocity, the front is
affected by the field through the quenching of the R-T instability growth in
the direction perpendicular to the field lines. As a consequence, an asymmetry
develops between the magnetic polar and the equatorial axis that gives a
prolate shape to the burning front. We have here computed numerically the total
integrated asymmetry as the flame front propagates outward through the
expanding shells of decreasing density of the magnetized white dwarf
progenitor, for several chemical compositions, and found that a total asymmetry
of about 50 % is produced between the polar and equatorial directions for
progenitors with a surface magnetic field B ~ 5 x 10^{7} G, and a composition
C12 = 0.2 and O16 = 0.8 (in this case, the R-T instability saturates at scales
\~ 20 times the width of the flame front). This asymmetry is in good agreement
with the inferred asymmetries from spectropolarimetric observations of very
young supernova remnants, which have recently revealed intrinsic linear
polarization interpreted as evidence of an asymmetric explosion in several
objects,such as SN1999by, SN1996X, and SN1997dt. Larger magnetic field
strengths will produce even larger asymmetries. We have also found that for
lighter progenitors the total asymmetry is larger.

on H2O lines, features previously hidden under H2O or O2 lines, light hydrides
and particularly on deuterium in molecules. Recently, multiply deuterated
species have been detected, e.g. ND3, in cold dense regions of the interstellar

trapped, by the fractionation process, into heavy molecules such as ND3,
etc..., and species such as H2D+ and possibly D2H+, that D and HD might be
depleted. This would be the mechanism for the large dispersion of [D]/[H]
values found in the interstellar medium. Light molecules (hydrides and
deuterides) generally have large fundamental rotation frequencies, often lying
in the HIFI bands. The deuterides are a specially suitable case, because the
species exist mainly in cold dense regions, where the molecules are in the
ground states and THz observations will best be carried out by absorption
spectroscopy against background dust continuum sources such as Sgr B2 and W49N.

emission. Molecular hydrogen traces cool gas and dust in the polar lobes, while
[Fe II] blankets their inner surfaces. These lines reveal the back wall of the
SE polar lobe for the first time, and give the clearest picture yet of the 3-D
geometry. Additionally, collisionally-excited [Fe II] reveals the kinematic
structure of a recently discovered `Little Homunculus' expanding inside the
larger one. Equatorial gas in the `Fan', on the other hand, shows a spectrum
indicating recombination and fluorescent pumping. Some equatorial ejecta glow
in the He I 10830 line, showing evidence for material ejected in the 1890
outburst of eta Car. Closer to the star, the compact `Weigelt blobs' are
marginally resolved, allowing their infrared spectrum to be separated from the

directional dependence of excitation in the Homunculus: polar ejecta are
collisionally excited, whereas equatorial ejecta are dominated by fluorescence
and normal photoexcitation. These are important clues to the geometry of the
central star's UV radiation field. Reflected near-infrared emission lines also
reveal interesting latitudinal dependence in the stellar wind.

V442 Ophiuchi and RX J1643.7+3402. These stars have high-excitation spectra,
complex line profiles signifying mass loss at particular orbital phases, and
similar orbital periods (respectively 0.12433 and 0.12056 d). They are
well-credentialed members of the SW Sex class of cataclysmic variables. Their
light curves are also quite complex. V442 Oph shows periodic signals with
periods of 0.12090(8) and 4.37(15) days, and RX J1643.7+3402 shows similar
signals at 0.11696(8) d and 4.05(12) d. We interpret these short and long
periods respectively as a ""negative superhump"" and the wobble period of the
accretion disk. The superhump could then possibly arise from the heating of the
secondary (and structures fixed in the orbital frame) by inner-disk radiation,
which reaches the secondary relatively unimpeded since the disk is not
coplanar.
  At higher frequencies, both stars show another type of variability:
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with a period near 1000 seconds. Underlying
these strong signals of low stability may be weak signals of higher stability.
Similar QPOs, and negative superhumps, are quite common features in SW Sex
stars. Both can in principle be explained by ascribing strong magnetism to the
white dwarf member of the binary; and we suggest that SW Sex stars are
borderline AM Herculis binaries, usually drowned by a high accretion rate. This
would provide an ancestor channel for AM Hers, whose origin is still
mysterious.

universal density profile for the dark matter halo, and an isothermal model for
the SSCs, our simulations have yielded bulges that are similar in many aspects
to the observational ones. In particular, the derived surface density profiles
can be well fitted by an exponential structure with nuclear cusps, which is
consistent with HST observations.The preliminary simulations with the Burkert
density profile yield very instructive predictions on the bulge formation,
which is surely worth further investigating.

groups. A 3sigma anti-correlation is observed between QSOs and galaxy groups.
This paucity of faint QSOs around groups is neither a selection effect nor due
to restrictions on the placement of 2dF fibres. By observing the colours of
QSOs on the scales of the anti-correlation, we limit dust in galaxy groups,
finding a maximum reddening of E(b_j-r) < 0.012 at the 95% level. The small
amount of dust thus inferred is insufficient to cause the anti-correlation,
supporting the suggestion by Croom & Shanks that the signal is due to
gravitational lensing. The possibility remains that tailored dust models, such
as grey dust, heavy patches of dust or a combination of dust and lensing, could
explain the anti-correlation. Assuming the signal is caused by lensing rather
than dust, we measure the average velocity dispersion of a Singular Isothermal
Sphere that would cause the anti-correlation as around 1150 km/s. Simulations
reject 600 km/s at the 5% significance level. We also model foreground lenses
as NFW haloes and measure the typical mass within 1.5 Mpc/h of the halo centre
as M_{1.5} = (1.2 +/- 0.9) x 10^{15} solarmasses/h. Regardless of whether we
utilise a SIS or NFW dark matter profile, our model favours more mass in groups
than accounted for in a universe with density parameter Omega_m = 0.3. Detailed
simulations and galaxy group redshifts will significantly reduce the current
systematic uncertainties in these $\Omega_m$ estimates. Reducing the remaining
uncertainty will require larger QSO and galaxy group surveys (abridged).

In gapless systems, the low temperature Drude weight is proportional to

theory that describes the system at low energies. On the other hand, the low
temperature Drude weight of spin gap systems shows an activated behavior
modulated by a power law. For temperatures higher than the spin gap, one
recovers the linear T behavior akin to gapless systems. For temperatures larger
than the exchange coupling, the Drude weight decays as 1/T^2. We argue that
this behavior is a generic feature of quasi one dimensional spin gap systems
with a relativistic-like low energy dispersion. We also consider the effect of
a magnetic field on the Drude weight with emphasis on the
commensurate-incommensurate transition induced by it. We then study the effect
of nonmagnetic impurities on the thermal conductivity of the dimerized XY chain
and the spin-1/2 two leg ladder. Impurities destroy the Drude peak and the
thermal conductivity exhibits a purely activated behavior at low temperature,
with an activation gap renormalized by disorder. The relevance of these results

study a system of vertically shaken granular layers. Despite the simplicity the
model shows pattern formation in the granular layers due to the formation of
heaplets. We show from a simple analysis that the onset of pattern formation is
density dependent and this result is justified by the subsequent computer
simulations. Our simulations also show that the heaping process can be divided
into three stages: an early stationary stage, an intermediate growing stage and
a late-time saturated stage. In the early stage, the average volume of the
heaplets remains almost unchanged until the system crosses over to the
intermediate growing stage. The length of time that system remains in the early
stage defines the onset time of the instabilities, $k_0$ which depends on the
shaking intensity, $\gamma$. In the growing stage, the average volume of the
heaplets grows with time and can be approximated by a power law with a shaking
intensity dependent growth exponent, $z$. From our simulation, we show that the
growth exponent, $z$ depends linearly on the shaking intensity, $\gamma$. There
is a critical shaking intensity $\gamma_c \simeq 14$, such that for shaking
intensities greater than $\gamma_c$, $z$ cannot be properly defined. The
late-time saturated stage is where most of the particles are trapped in a big
heap and this big heap is in equilibrium with the surrounding granular gas.

that the correlations between quasiparticles that give rise to the collective
state are associated with an increase in $z$ and a corresponding decrease in
$m^*$ of the carriers. Undressing gives rise to lowering of kinetic energy,
which provides the condensation energy for the collective state. In contrast,

double beta decay of 130Te. In terms of effective neutrino mass this is the
most restrictive limit in direct experiments, after those obtained with Ge

be compatible with regularity of the geometry. In particular, the Boulware

in some well-known exactly solvable models (for example, RST). Formally, they
appear to account for an additional coefficient $B$ in the solutions (for the
same Lagrangian which contains also ''traditional'' solutions) that gives rise
to the deviation of temperature $T$ from its Hawking value $T_{H}$. The
Lorentzian geometry, which is a self-consistent solution of the semiclassical
field equations, in such models, is smooth even at $B\neq 0$ and there is no
need to put B=0 ($T=T_{H}$) to smooth it out$.$ We show how the presence of
$B\neq 0$ affects the structure of spacetime. In contrast to ''usual'' black
holes, full fledged thermodynamic interpretation, including definite value of
entropy, can be ascribed (for a rather wide class of models) to extremal
horizons, not to nonextreme ones. We find also new exact solutions for
''usual'' black holes (with $T=T_{H}$). The properties under discussion arise
in the \QTR{it}{weak}-coupling regime of the effective constant of
dilaton-gravity interaction. Extension of features, traced in 2D models, to 4D

irreducible representations of this group, which yields the particle spectrum

found that each standard relativistic particle is associated with a

pseudo-partners act as Pauli-Villars regulators for the other member of the

theory on real spacetime possesses a field phase space with integrable

explore the geometric, algebraic, and computational implications of the
presence of discrete symmetries in semidefinite programs. It is shown that
symmetry exploitation allows a significant reduction in both matrix size and
number of decision variables. This result is applied to semidefinite programs
arising from the computation of sum of squares decompositions for multivariate
polynomials. The results, reinterpreted from an invariant-theoretic viewpoint,
provide a novel representation of a class of nonnegative symmetric polynomials.
The main theorem states that an invariant sum of squares polynomial is a sum of
inner products of pairs of matrices, whose entries are invariant polynomials.
In these pairs, one of the matrices is computed based on the real irreducible
representations of the group, and the other is a sum of squares matrix. The
reduction techniques enable the numerical solution of large-scale instances,
otherwise computationally infeasible to solve.

thereby governed by two competing effects: The enlarged phase space volume in
colliding matter tends to soften the internal potential energy of the
subsystems whereas the relative motion of the two currents leads to a strong
additional repulsion in the system. An effective EOS constructed for
anisotropic momentum configurations shows a significant net softening compared
to ground state nuclear matter. This effect is found to be to large extend

discussion of standard transport approaches with respect to the considered

3-dimensional, permeable space. Particles travel freely and are scattered off
into random directions when they hit the fractal. The statistical distribution
of the flight increments (i.e. of the displacements between two consecutive
hittings) is analytically derived from a common, practical definition of
fractal dimension, and it turns out to approximate quite well a power-law in
the case where the dimension D of the fractal is less than 2, there is though
always a finite rate of unaffected escape. Random walks through fractal sets
with D less or equal 2 can thus be considered as defective Levy walks. The
distribution of jump increments for D > 2 is decaying exponentially. The
diffusive behavior of the random walk is analyzed in the frame of continuous
time random walk, which we generalize to include the case of defective
distributions of walk-increments. It is shown that the particles undergo
anomalous, enhanced diffusion for D_F < 2, the diffusion is dominated by the
finite escape rate. Diffusion for D_F > 2 is normal for large times, enhanced
though for small and intermediate times. In particular, it follows that
fractals generated by a particular class of self-organized criticality (SOC)
models give rise to enhanced diffusion. The analytical results are illustrated
by Monte-Carlo simulations.

feasibility of such measurements. Two models of the atmosphere are invoked: a
quiet atmosphere with a hydrostatic coupling of pressure and density and a
dynamic model of moving region of the density anomaly (cyclone). Both models
lead to similar conclusions up to numerical factors. Besides the hydrostatic
approximation, we use a model of turbulent atmosphere with the pressure
fluctuation spectrum f^{-7/3} to explore the Newtonian noise in a higher
frequency domain (up to 10 Hz) predicting the gravitational noise background
for modern gravitational wave detectors. Our estimates show that this could
pose a serious problem for realization of such projects. Finally, angular
fluctuations of spatially separated pendula are investigated via computer
simulation for some realistic atmospheric data giving the level estimate
10^{-11} rad/sqrt(Hz) at frequency 10^{-4} Hz. This looks promising for the
possibility of the measurement of weak gravity effects such as Earth inner core
oscillations.

allows to extend the scope of game theory for the quantum world. The paper
presents the history, basic ideas and recent development in quantum game
theory. In this context, a new application of the Ising chain model is
proposed.

optics. Although this process is well understood, the phase shifts induced by
this diffraction process are not well known. In this paper, we make analytic
calculations of these phase shifts in some simple cases and we use these
results to model the contrast interferometer recently built by the group of D.
Pritchard at MIT. We thus show that the values of the diffraction phases are
large and that they probably contribute to the phase noise observed in this
experiment.
