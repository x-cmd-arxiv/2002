previously unknown, strongly shocked region is located ~0.1 pc northwest of the

in the HCN and the N2H+ emission associated with shocked regions. I construct a
simple, qualitative chemical model where the N2H+ emission increases in the
magnetic precursor of a C-type shock, while N2H+ is destroyed deeper in the
shock as the neutrals heat up and species like HCN and water are released from
icy grain mantles. I conclude that N2H+ is a reliable tracer of cloud material,

this resolved emission is associated with either dust heated in the nuclear
active region or with bremsstrahlung emission from the nuclear and extended
ionised gas. The size of the mid-IR emission contrasts with the standard
unification scenario envisaging a compact dusty structure surrounding and
hiding the active nucleus and the broad-line region. The mid-IR data are
complemented with ISOPHOT aperture photometry in the 25--200 micron range. The
overall IR spectral energy distribution is dominated by a well-defined
component peaking at about 100$ micron, a characteristic temperature of T ~20
K, and an associated dust mass of 2.5 x 10E7 Msun, which greatly dominates the
total dust mass content of the galaxy. The heating mechanism of this dust is
probably the interstellar radiation field. After subtracting the contribution
of this cold dust component, the bulk of the residual emission is attributed to
dust heated within the nuclear environment. Its luminosity consistently
accounts for the reprocessing of the X-ray to UV emission derived for the
nucleus of this galaxy. The comparison of NGC 5252 spectral energy distribution

constructing so-called `population boxes'). The main results of this initial
study are that the star formation rate in SDSS galaxies has been in decline for
~6 Gyr; a metallicity distribution for star-forming gas which is peaked ~3 Gyr
ago at about solar metallicity, inconsistent with closed-box models, but
consistent with infall models. We also determine the infall rate of gas in SDSS
and show that it has been significant for the last 3 Gyr. We investigate errors
using a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain algorithm. Further, we demonstrate that
recovering star formation and metallicity histories for such a large sample
becomes intractable without data compression methods, particularly the
exploration of the likelihood surface. By exploring the whole likelihood
surface we show that age-metallicity degeneracies are not as severe as by using
only a few spectral features. We find that 65% of galaxies contain a
significant old population (with an age of at least 8 Gyr), including recent

superiority of M stars) more than compensate for the reduced signal due to the
lower luminosity of the later-type stars. That is, M stars can yield reliable
transit detections at much fainter apparent magnitudes than G stars. However,
to achieve this greater sensitivity, the later-type stars must be monitored to
these correspondingly fainter magnitudes, which can engender several practical
problems. We show that with modest modifications, the Kepler mission could
extend its effective sensitivity from its current M_V=6 to M_V=9. This would
not capture the whole M dwarf peak, but would roughly triple its sensitivity to

formation and chemical enrichment including infall and outflow of gas to find
that the trend towards supersolar [Mg/Fe] in massive ellipticals excludes a
pure metallicity sequence as an explanation of the colour-magnitude relation.
An age spread is required, attributable either to a range of star formation
efficiencies or to a range of infall timescales. We find that the inferred
range of stellar ages is compatible with the small scatter and the redshift
evolution of the colour-magnitude relation. Two alternative scenarios can
explain the data: fixed infall with an efficiency which is linearly dependent
on mass, or a fixed efficiency with a mass-dependent infall timescale
t~1/sqrt(M). We conclude that the actual scenario may well involve a
combination of these two parameters, with mass dependencies which should span
the range of those given above.

that the postshock regions toward the east of the SNR might have been reheated
by the reverse shock off the dense molecular clouds while the blast wave shock
front has decelerated as it propagates into the dense clouds. The X-ray

constraints on the allowed normalization and power-law slope of the M_bh-sigma
relation or on the fraction of BH binaries that proceed to coalescence; (ii)

cluster of galaxies has been tested using surface-brightness fluctuations. The
main result is that the intergalactic globular cluster surface density ($N_{\rm
IGC}$) does not correlate with the distance to the center of Coma and hence
with the environment. Furthermore, comparing these results with different Coma
mass-distribution model predictions, it is suggested that $N_{\rm IGC}$ must in
fact be zero all over Coma. On the other hand, the results for $N_{\rm IGC}$
and the faint end of the galaxy number counts (beyond $m_R=23.5$) are
connected. So $N_{\rm IGC}=0$ settles the slope of this function, which turns
out to be $\gamma=0.36\pm0.01$ down to $m_R=26.5$.
  The fact that $N_{\rm IGC}=0$ all over Coma suggests that globular clusters
were formed only, or almost only, from protogalactic clouds. None, or perhaps
very few, could have formed in isolated regions. It also seems inappropriate to
advocate a relationship between intergalactic globular clusters and dark matter
distributions, although it is true that the relationship could still exist but
not be strong enough to have been detected. Finally, since our conclusion is
that intergalactic globular clusters do not exist in Coma, accretion of
intergalactic globular clusters might not be significant in galaxy formation
and evolutionary processes in the Coma galaxies.

of these low mass disks, we discuss here detailed emission line calculations
for alternative tracers like C and C+, based on recent optically thin disk
models by Kamp & van Zadelhoff (2001). The [CII] 157.7 mum line was searched
toward Vega and beta Pictoris -- the most prominent A stars with disks -- using
ISO LWS data, and a tentative detection is reported toward the latter object.
  From a comparison with emission line observations as well as absorption line
studies of both stars, the gas-to-dust ratio is constrained to lie between 0.5

limit of 0.2 M_Earth for the disk gas mass. Predicted line intensities of C+

the gas content in the disks around A stars with future instrumental

mass-selected sample of early-type galaxies in environments of relatively low
density. We analyse the FP and its evolution in the restframe Johnson B and
Gunn r bands. Assuming that early-type galaxies are a homologous family, the FP
then provides a direct measurement of the M/L ratio evolution. If we assume
that the M/L ratios of field early-type galaxies evolve as power-laws, we find
for the lens galaxies an evolution rate dlog(M/L)/dz of -0.62 +/-0.13 in
restframe B, corresponding to a mean stellar formation redshift of <z*>=1.8
(-0.5/+1.4). This formation epoch does not differ significantly from that of
cluster galaxies <z*cl>=2.0 (-0.2/+0.3), obtained by van Dokkum & Franx (2001)
after correction for maximum progenitor bias. However, if we impose the
constraint that lens and cluster galaxies that are of the same age have equal
M/L ratios and we do not correct for progenitor bias, we find that the stellar
populations of the lens galaxies are 10-15 % younger. We find that both the M/L
ratios as well as the restframe colors of the lens galaxies show significant
scatter. About half of the lens galaxies are consistent with an old
cluster-like stellar populations, but the other galaxies are bluer and best fit
by single burst models with younger stellar formation redshifts as low as z*~1.
Moreover, the scatter in color is correlated with the scatter in M/L ratio. We
interpret this as evidence of a significant age spread among the stellar
populations of lens galaxies, whereas the ages of the stellar populations of
the cluster galaxies are well approximated by a single formation epoch.

most likely too young to be members of the galactic halo, while the tangential
velocities of the cooler and thus older white dwarfs are shown to be entirely
consistent with the disk population. The results suggest that some white dwarf
stars born in the young disk may have high velocities with respect to the local
standard of rest. Such objects could represent the remnants of donor stars from
close mass-transfer binaries that produced type Ia supernovae via the single
degenerate channel, or other scenarios suggested in the literature. Ongoing
surveys that rely solely on reduced proper motion diagrams are likely to
identify more of these high velocity young degenerates, rather than to unveil
the old white dwarf population of the galactic halo. The importance of infrared
photometry for studying extremely cool white dwarfs is also emphasized.

location at the periphery of the dense cores, it suffers small foreground
visual extinction (Av=2.1\pm2.6 mag). Although this disk is seen close to
edge-on, the two reflection nebulae display very different colors. We introduce
a new NIR data visualization called ``Pixel NIR Color Mapping'', which allows
to visualize directly the NIR colors of the nebula pixels. Thanks to this
method we identify a ridge, 0.3"" (40 AU at 140 pc) to the north of the dark

challenge at a more fundamental level. The concept of activation barriers is
very convenient for the interpretation of experiments and as input for Monte
Carlo simulations but may become inadequate when mismatch with the substrate
and molecular vibrations are considered. We study the simplest objects
diffusing on a substrate at finite temperature $T$, namely an adatom and a
diatomic molecule (dimer), using the Langevin approach. In the driven case, we
analyse the characteristic curves, comparing the motion for different values of
the intramolecular spacing, both for T=0 and $T\ne 0$. The mobility of the
dimer is higher than that of the monomer when the drift velocity is less than
the natural stretching frequency. The role of intramolecular excitations is
crucial in this respect. In the undriven case, the diffusive dynamics is
considered as a function of temperature. Contrary to atomic diffusion, for the
dimer it is not possible to define a single, temperature independent,
activation barrier. Our results suggest that vibrations can account for drastic
variations of the activation barrier. This reveals a complex behaviour

First, we consider a symmetric mixture with attractive interactions, possibly
relevant for describing fluids of molecules with internal degrees of freedom.
Despite the simplicity of the model, slightly tuning the strength of the
interactions between unlike species drastically changes the topology of the
phase boundary, forcing or inhibiting demixing, and brings about several
interesting features such as double critical points, tricritical points, and
coexistence domains enclosing `islands' of homogeneous, mixed fluid.
Homogeneous phase separation in mixtures can be driven also by purely repulsive
interactions. As an example, we consider a model of soft particles which has
been adopted to describe binary polymer solutions. This is shown to display
demixing (fluid-fluid) transition at sufficiently high density. The nature and

energetically favorable for single holes, pairs of holes or small bound-hole
clusters to hop from one hole-rich domain to another due to quantum
fluctuations. However, we find that at temperature of approximately 100 K, the
probability for bound hole-pair exchange between neighboring hole-rich regions
in the stripe phase, is one or two orders of magnitude larger than single-hole
or multi-hole droplet exchange. As a result holes in a given hole-rich domain
penetrate further into the antiferromagnetically aligned domains when they do
it in pairs. At temperature of about 100 K and below bound pairs of holes hop
from one hole-rich domain to another with high probability. Therefore our main
finding is that the presence of the antiferromagnetic hole-poor domains act as
a filter which selects, from the hole-rich domains (where holes form a
self-bound liquid), hole pairs which can be exchanged throughout the system.
This fluid of bound hole pairs can undergo a superfluid phase ordering at the

the {\it gliding motion} of a single {\it floater} over the cluster surface
yields extremely small values of the energy barriers regardless of the shapes
of clusters. In particular, the {\it gliding motion} of a train composed of a
few surface atoms also appears as the low-lying saddles. As a result, the
barrier height corresponding to the {\it simultaneous gliding motion}, which is
a manifestation of the reaction path crossing the higher-index saddles on PES,
is significantly low. (ii)A surface rearrangement, where {\it floaters} are
created or annihilated, implies relatively high barrier energy which is still
accessible below melting point. (iii)On the other hand, the atomic motion,
where atoms located deep inside of the clusters are rearranged as well as
surface atoms, yields extremely high barrier energies. Some relations between
these results and the recent experimental study of the surface cluster
diffusion are also pointed out.

Sitter space which generates the hierarchy in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model.
The $\delta$ additional dimensions may be required when the RS model is
embedded into a more fundamental theory. We analyze two classes of
$\delta-$dimensional manifolds: flat and curved geometries. In the first case,
the additional flat dimensions may accommodate localized fermions which in turn
could resolve issues, such as proton decay and flavor, that were not addressed
in the original RS proposal. In the latter case, the positive curvature of an
$S^\delta$ manifold with $\delta> 1$ can geometrically provide the
5-dimensional warping of the RS model. We demonstrate the key features of these
two classes of models by presenting the background solutions, the spectra of
the Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, and their 4-dimensional couplings, for the
sample manifolds $S^1/Z_2$, $S^1$, and $S^2$. The resulting phenomenology is
distinct from that of the original RS scenario due to the appearance of a
multitude of new KK graviton states at the weak scale with couplings that are
predicted to be measurably non-universal within the KK tower. In addition, in
the case of flat compactifications, fermion localization can result in KK
graviton and gauge field flavor changing interactions.

matter with self-interactions characterized by a negative pressure; there is no
vacuum energy whatsoever in this Cardassian model. These self-interactions may
arise due to a long-range ""fifth force"" which grows with the distance between
particles. We use the ordinary Friedmann equation, $H^2 = 8 \pi G \rho/3$, and
take the energy density to be the sum of two terms: $\rho = \rho_M + \rho_K$.
Here $\rho_M \equiv m n_M$ is the ordinary mass density and $\rho_K \equiv
\rho_K(\rho_M)$ is a new interaction term which depends only on the matter
density. For example, in the original version of the Cardassian model, $\rho_K
= b \rho_M^n$ with $n<2/3$; other examples are studied as well. We use the
ordinary four-dimensional Einstein's equations $G_{\mu\nu} = 8 \pi G T_{\mu\nu}

ansatz, we can compute the accompanying pressure, and use the conservation of
the energy-momentum tensor to obtain modified forms of the Euler's equation,
Poisson equation, and continuity equation. With this fully relativistic
description, one will then be able to compute growth of density perturbations,
effects on the Cosmic Background Radiation, and other effects with an eye to
observational tests of the model.

corresponding to the electron neutrino oscillation at CHOOZ are radiatively
generated through the standard electroweak gauge interactions. All the leptonic
mass matrices having zero $\Delta_{odot}$ and $U_{e3}$ at a high scale lead to
a unique low energy value for the $\Delta_{odot}$ which is determined by the
(known) size of the radiative corrections, solar and the atmospheric mixing
angle and the Majorana mass of the neutrino observed in neutrinoless double
beta decay. This prediction leads to the following consequences: ($i$) The MSSM
radiative corrections generate only the dark side of the solar neutrino
solutions. ($ii$) The inverted mass hierarchy ($m,-m,0$) at the high scale
fails in generating the LMA solution but it can lead to the LOW or vacuum
solutions. ($iii$) The $\Delta_{odot}$ generated in models with maximal solar
mixing at a high scale is zero to the lowest order in the radiative parameter.
It tends to get suppressed as a result of this and lies in the vacuum region.
We discuss specific textures which can lead to the LMA solution in the present
framework and provide a gauge theoretical realization of this in the context of
the seesaw model.

means of an explicit calculation of the 3-loop beta-function for a pure
Yang-Mills theory. To maintain manifest background invariance throughout our
calculation, we stay in coordinate space and treat the background field
non-perturbatively. In this way the presence of a background field does not
increase the number of vertices and leads to a relatively small number of
vacuum graphs in the effective action. Restricting to a covariantly constant
background field in Fock-Schwinger gauge permits explicit expansion of all
quantum field propagators in powers of the field strength only. Hence, Feynman
graphs are at most logarithmically divergent. At 2-loop order only a single
Feynman graph without subdivergences needs to be calculated. At 3-loop order 24
graphs remain. Insisting on manifest background gauge invariance at all stages
of a calculation is thus shown to be a major labor saving device. All
calculations were performed with Mathematica in view of its superior pattern
matching capabilities. Finally, we describe briefly the extension of such
covariant methods to the case of supergravity theories.

theories. In confining theories without matter fields in fundamental
representation the magnetic symmetry is spontaneously broken. Under some mild
assumptions, the low-energy dynamics is determined universally by this
spontaneous breaking phenomenon. The degrees of freedom in the effective theory
are magnetic vortices. Their role in confining dynamics is similar to that
played by pions and sigma in the chiral symmetry breaking dynamics.
  I give an explicit derivation of the effective theory in (2+1)-dimensional
weakly coupled confining models and argue that it remains qualitatively the
same in strongly coupled (2+1)-dimensional gluodynamics. Confinement in this
effective theory is a very simple classical statement about the long range
interaction between topological solitons, which follows (as a result of a
simple direct classical calculation) from the structure of the effective
Lagrangian. I show that if fundamentally charged dynamical fields are present
the magnetic symmetry becomes local rather than global. The modifications to
the effective low energy description in the case of heavy dynamical fundamental
matter are discussed. This effective lagrangian naturally yields a bag like
description of baryonic excitations. I also discuss the fate of the magnetic
symmetry in gauge theories with the Chern-Simons term.

the wave functions, in both the unbroken and the algebraically non-trivial
broken phase, demonstrates the utility of this formalism.

  condition","6 pages, Latex",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Assuming the condition of no superluminal signalling, we got an upper bound
on the quality of all asymmetric $ 1\to 2$ cloning machines, acting on qubits
whose Bloch vectors lie on a great circle. Then we constructed an $ 1\to 2$
cloning machine, which asymmetrically clone all qubits corresponding to this
great circle, and this machine matches with that upper bound, and hence this is
optimal one.

entanglement-assisted capacity of quantum channel with additive constraint
(such as bosonic Gaussian channel). The main tools are the coding theorem for
classical-quantum constrained channels and a finite dimensional approximation
of the input density operators for entanglement-assisted capacity. The new
version contains improved formulation of sufficient conditions under which
suprema in the capacity formulas are attained.
