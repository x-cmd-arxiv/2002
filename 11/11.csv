  Copenhagen, Aug 2002",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Magnetic fields play a dual role in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). First, GRB and
afterglow spectra (the latter interpreted as emission from external shocks)
imply synchrotron radiation in a magnetic field that is a significant fraction
of equipartition with the particle energy density. Second, magnetized rotators
with $\sim 10^{15}$ Gauss field may power GRB by transporting Poynting flux to
large distances where it dissipates and also drives an external shock. The
field amplification at external shocks and in the engine involve separate
processes. External shock fields are likely either seeded by a pre-GRB wind, or
are amplified by two-stream plasma instabilities with MHD turbulence playing a
subsequent role. In the engine, the large scale fields are likely produced by
MHD helical dynamos, since flux accretion cannot easily compete with turbulent
diffusion, and because structures must be large enough to rise to coronae
before diffusing. Why helical dynamos are feasible, and their relation to the
magnetorotational instability are among the points discussed.

population of highly absorbed sources located at large distances from the

with the ellipticity and position angle of the galaxy, but the sources appear
to form several arcs. NGC 720 contains nine ultraluminous sources (L_x >= 10^39

NGC 1553 and a factor of seven higher than for the elliptical galaxy NGC 4697,
although uncertainties in the distance and the source spectral properties could
bring these ratios into agreement. The X-ray source luminosity function is also
nearly as flat as those seen in disk and merger systems. The large number of

of lensed quasars taking account of the redshift and magnitude distributions of
the quasar catalog. Given some of the six pairs are genuine lensed systems, we
put interesting constraints on the inner slope of dark halos, \Omega_0, and
\sigma_8. We show that the detection of even one lens with separation >30'' is
marginally consistent with models that have cuspy inner density profile, \rho

reconcile with constraints from X-ray clusters or cosmic shear, much lower
\Omega_0 and much higher \sigma_8 are needed, although such high \sigma_8 seems
too extreme. The shallower inner density profile \rho \propto r^{-1} is hardly
acceptable. In particular, the expected number of lenses with separation >200''
is too small to explain the discovery of such anomalously wide separation lens
systems. These results imply that we miss some important systematic effects,
there is a problem in the cold dark matter scenario, or none of these six

tides generated in a uniformly rotating stellar component of a close binary.
The companion is considered to move in a fixed Keplerian orbit, and the effects
of the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force are neglected. Semi-analytical
solutions for the linear, nonadiabatic resonant dynamic tides are derived by
means of a two-time variable expansion procedure. The solution at the lowest
order of approximation consists of the resonantly excited oscillation mode and
displays a phase shift with respect to the tide-generating potential.
Expressions are established for the secular variations of the semi-major axis,
the orbital eccentricity, and the star's angular velocity of rotation caused by
the phase shift. The orders of magnitude of these secular variations are
considerably larger than those derived earlier by Zahn (1977) for the limiting
case of dynamic tides with small frequencies. For a 5 solar mass ZAMS star, an
orbital eccentricity e = 0.5, and orbital periods in the range from 2 to 5
days, numerous resonances of dynamic tides with second-degree lower-order
gravity modes are seen to induce secular variations of the semi-major axis, the
orbital eccentricity, and the star's angular velocity of rotation with time
scales shorter than the star's nuclear life time.

cannot draw any conclusions about the values of the opacity gradients at high

phenomenon of electrophonic sounds from meteors are still eluding complete
physical explanation. According to the accepted knowledge, the sound itself is
created by strong electric fields on the ground induced by the meteor.
Nonetheless, there is no convincing theory that can fully explain how a meteor
can generate such a strong electric field. Extreme rareness of the phenomenon
has prevented a substantial experimental work so far; thus, consequently, it
remains on the margins of scientific interest. This is quite unfortunate since
these electric fields suggest existence of a highly complex electromagnetic
coupling and charge dynamics between the meteors and the ionosphere. Therefore,
the existing theoretical work relies mostly on the witness reports. The Global
Electrophonic Fireball Survey (GEFS) is the first systematic survey of witness
reports of these sounds with a standardized questionnaire designed exclusively
for this phenomenon. Here we present the overall picture of the phenomenon that
emerged after almost 100 reports collected by GEFS. It becomes clear now that
the lover meteor brightness limit is about -2$^m$, suggesting a bias in the
existing electrophonic sounds catalogues toward brighter meteors. In contrast
to the current belief that such low brightness electrophonic meteors produce
transient sounds, we find that they can also produce sustained sounds. The
current theories can not accommodate these results. We revive the old idea that
the electrophonic sounds can be created by the corona discharge mechanism, in
addition to the existing prevalent suggestion of resonant vibration of objects
on the ground.

and orientation. To study this geometry dependence in the case of two deformed

which properly treats the many-body nature of the interaction, going beyond the
commonly used pairwise summation (PWS) of van der Waals forces. For arbitrary
deformations we provide an analytical result for the deformation induced change
in Casimir energy, which is exact to second order in the deformation amplitude.
For the specific case of sinusoidally corrugated plates, we calculate both the
normal and the lateral Casimir forces. The deformation induced change in the
Casimir interaction of a flat and a corrugated plate shows an interesting
crossover as a function of the ratio of the mean platedistance H to the
corrugation length \lambda: For \lambda \ll H we find a slower decay \sim
H^{-4}, compared to the H^{-5} behavior predicted by PWS which we show to be
valid only for \lambda \gg H. The amplitude of the lateral force between two
corrugated plates which are out of registry is shown to have a maximum at an
optimal wavelength of \lambda \approx 2.5 H. With increasing H/\lambda \gtrsim
0.3 the PWS approach becomes a progressively worse description of the lateral
force due to many-body effects. These results may be of relevance for the
design and operation of novel microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and other
nanoscale devices.

glass models with short range random interactions. In the first model a \pm
J-distribution of the bonds is chosen, in the second model a Gaussian
distribution. In both cases the first two moments of the distribution are
chosen to be J_0=-1, Delta J=+1, so that no ferromagnetic ordering of the Potts
spins can occur. We find that for all temperatures investigated the spin glass
susceptibility remains finite, the spin glass order parameter remains zero, and
that the specific heat has only a smooth Schottky-like peak. These results can
be understood quantitatively by considering small but independent clusters of
spins. Hence we have evidence that there is no static phase transition at any
nonzero temperature. Consistent with these findings, only very minor size
effects are observed, which implies that all correlation lengths of the models
remain very short. We also compute for both models the time auto-correlation
function C(t) of the Potts spins. While in the Gaussian model C(t) shows a
smooth uniform decay, the correlator for the \pm J model has several distinct
steps. These steps correspond to the breaking of bonds in small clusters of
ferromagnetically coupled spins (dimers, trimers, etc.). The relaxation times
follow simple Arrhenius laws, with activation energies that are readily
interpreted within the cluster picture, giving evidence that the system does
not have a dynamic transition at a finite temperature. Hence we find that for
the present models all the transitions known for the mean-field version of the
model are completely wiped out. Finally we also determine the time
auto-correlation functions of individual spins, and show that the system is

distinctive feature of granular media (common to many other `jammed' systems)
is indeed the large number of metastable states that are macroscopically
equivalent. We present in detail the (scalar) $q$-model and its tensorial
generalization, that aim at modelling the existence of force chains and arching
effects without introducing any displacement field. The contrast between the
hyperbolic equations obtained within this line of thought and elliptic
(elastic) equations is emphasized. The role of disorder on these hyperbolic
equations is studied in details using perturbative and diagrammatic methods.
Recent (strong disorder) force chain network models are reviewed, and compared
with the experimental determination of the force `response function' in
granular materials. We briefly discuss several issues (such as isostaticity and
generic marginality) and open problems. At the end of these notes, we also
discuss the basic dynamical properties of_weakly tapped_ granular assemblies,
and stress the phenomenological analogies with other glassy materials. Simple
models that account for slow compaction and dynamical heterogeneities are
presented, that are inspired by `free-volume' ideas and Edwards' assumption. A
connection with the theory of fluctuating random surfaces, also noted recently

least when driven by local dynamics. Depending on the control parameter, the

studied using the dynamical Monte Carlo method. This model has two dynamically

aforementioned result presents a relevant theoretical interest. In addition,
since such wire media have been recently used as a constituent of some discrete
artificial media (or metamaterials), the reported results open the question of
the relevance of the spatial dispersion in the characterization of these

used to calculate the effective permittivity and permeability in the frequency

both the effective permittivity and permeability are negative is analyzed. Some
open and controversial questions are discussed. It is shown that previous
experimental results confirming the existence of backward waves in such a

However, these parameters are not quasi-static and thus the known analytical
formulas for the effective material parameters of this structure, which have

the reason of some objections to the authors of that experiment.

  For weak disorder and short range interaction we recover the expected result
that disorder enhances the relaxation rate as compared to the case without
disorder. For sufficiently strong disorder, however, we find an opposite trend
due to the reduction of scattering probabilities originating from the strong
localization of the single--particle states. Long--range interaction in this
regime produces a similar effect. The relaxation rate is found to scale with
the interaction strength, however, the interplay between the implicit and the
explicit character of the interaction produces an anomalous exponent.

the fields. Since the Transverse Lattice is a Light-Front field theory, it
lacks manifest rotational invariance. This lack of manifest rotational
invariance is exploited to determine the couplings in the effective action by
calculating the Quark/Anti-quark Potential, an observable that is very
sensitive to rotational symmetry. This calculation lays the groundwork for a
fully 3+1 dimensional treatment of the Transverse Lattice.

Two types of self-duality inherent in the nonlinear electrodynamics models

identities amounts to requiring E to be a function of the SO(2) invariant

  Our major result is the equivalence of the KMS condition and the variational
principle with a minimal assumption for the dynamics and without any explicit
assumption on the potential. It holds also for spin lattice systems as well,
yielding a vast improvement over known results.
  All formulations are in terms of a C*-dynamical systems for the Fermion (CAR)

  (I) The interaction is even with respect to the Fermion number.
(Automatically satisfied when (IV) below is assumed.)
  (II) All strictly local elements of the algebra have the first time
derivative.
  (III) The time derivatives in (II) determine the dynamics.
  (IV) The interaction is lattice translation invariant.
  A major technical tool is the conditional expectation from the total algebra
onto the local subalgebra for any finite subset of the lattice, which induces a
system of commuting squares. This technique overcomes the lack of tensor
product structures for Fermion systems and even simplifies many known arguments
for spin lattice systems.

interaction that can be used in various studies involving $\pi$-nucleus
channels. Based on earlier treatments of the low energy $\pi$-nucleus optical
potential, we have derived a potential expression applicable from threshold up
to the $\Delta$-resonance region. We extracted the impulse approximation form
for this potential from the $\pi-N$ scattering amplitude and then added to it
kinematical and physical corrections. The kinematic corrections arise from
transforming the impulse approximation expression from the $\pi-N$ center of
mass frame to the $\pi$-nucleus center of mass frame, while the physical
corrections arise mostly from the many-body nature of the $\pi$-nucleus
interaction. By taking advantage of the experimental progress in our knowledge
of the $\pi-N$ process, we have updated earlier treatments with parameters
calculated from state-of-the-art experimental measurements.

that the variation of the transmitted intensity with the rotation angle
deviates from Malus Law, exhibiting a cyclic fluctuation with the rotation

based on the interference effect produced from the air-gap in the prisms. The

proper cut angle of prism and reducing the thickness of air-gap in prism, the

set of liquid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements on a molecule
containing two coupled hydrogen nuclei, which are sufficient to fully determine
its relaxation superoperator. It was found that the complete positivity
constraint, which is necessary for the existence of the Lindblad operators, was
also essential for obtaining a robust fit to the measurements. The general
approach taken here promises to be broadly useful in studying dissipative
quantum processes in many of the diverse experimental systems currently being
developed for quantum information processing purposes.

processes are described within the formalism of quantum Boltzmann master
equation. The inhibition of the spontaneous emission can be overcome by
properly adjusting the spontaneous Raman rate during the cooling. Our numerical
results based in Monte Carlo simulations of the corresponding rate equations,
show that three-dimensional temperatures of the order of $0.08 T_F$

investigate the statistical properties of the equilibrium distribution of the
laser-cooled gas, showing that the number fluctuations are enhanced compared

the heating related to the background losses, concluding that our laser-cooling
scheme should maintain the temperature of the gas without significant
