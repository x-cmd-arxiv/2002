in the centers of four nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies: Sculptor, Fornax,
Carina and Leo I. We measure the abundance variations of numerous elements in
these low mass stars with a range of ages (1-15Gyr old). This means that we can
effectively measure the chemical evolution of these galaxies WITH TIME. Our
results show a significant spread in metallicity with age, but an overall trend
consistent with what might be expected from a closed (or perhaps leaky) box
chemical evolution scenario over the last 10-15Gyr. We notice that each of
these galaxies show broadly similar abundance patterns for all elements
measured. This suggests a fairly uniform progression of chemical evolution with
time, despite quite a large range of star formation histories. It seems likely
that these galaxies had similar initial conditions, and evolve in a similar
manner with star formation occurring at a uniformly low rate, even if at
different times. With our accurate measurements we find evidence for small
variations in abundances which are correlated to variations in star formation
histories. The alpha-elements suggest that dSph chemical evolution has not been
affected by very high mass stars (>15-20 Msun). The abundance patterns we
measure for stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies are significantly different from
those typically observed in the disk, bulge and inner-halo of our Galaxy. This
suggests that it is NOT possible to construct a significant fraction of our
Galaxy from STARS formed in these dwarf spheroidal galaxies which subsequently
merged into our own. Any merger scenario involving dSph has to occur in the
very early Universe whilst they are still gas rich, so the majority of mass
transfer is gas, and few stars.

magnetic fields in fair agreement with observational limits. Furthermore, the
Hanle depolarization signals of the Sr I 4607 A line turn out to be within the

also be found. There is a shortage of Stokes V asymmetries, that we attribute
to a deficit of structuring in the magnetic and velocity fields from the
simulations as compared to the Sun This deficit may reflect the fact that the
Reynolds numbers of the numerical data are still far from solar values. We
consider the possibility that intense and tangled magnetic fields, like those
in the simulations, exist in the Sun. This scenario has several important
consequences. For example, less than 10% of the existing unsigned magnetic flux
would be detected in present magnetograms. The existing flux would exceed by
far that carried by active regions during the maximum of the solar cycle.
Detecting these magnetic fields would involve improving the angular resolution,
the techniques to interpret the polarization signals, and to a less extent, the
polarimetric sensitivity.

  Based on The Lyman-Alpha Forest",,,,,"astro-ph",,"  In recent years, the possibility of measuring the cosmological constant
$\Omega_\Lambda$ through the application of the Alcock-Paczynski test to the
Lyman Alpha (Ly$\alpha$) forest has been suggested (McDonald et al. 1999; Hui
et al. 1999). Despite the theoretical uncertainties due to a few other
cosmological parameters, some of the greatest difficulties we encounter concern
the huge uncertainties due to cosmic variance and noise. In this paper, we
propose a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to deal with cosmic
variance and noise using synthetic spectra of quasistellar objects (QSOs) from
our cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We demonstrate that the MLE method
can overcome the cosmic variance problem. Applying the MLE method, we find that
we have more than 90% probability to determine $\Omega_\Lambda$ within 20%
error and approximately of 66% probability to determine $\Omega_\Lambda$ within
10% error by using 30 pairs QSO spectra when other cosmological parameters are
assumed. Another important source of error is from noise in the flux spectra,
and we have modeled the corresponding effect by studying artificial spectra
with different kinds of noise added. We discover that the noise distribution
does not have significant effect on the final cross-correlation functions as
long as the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is fixed. Finally, a preliminary test
and discussion about the sensitivities to other cosmological parameters are
included in this paper as well.

1313, which contains two ""ultra-luminous"" X-ray (ULX) sources. We measure
isotropic luminosities of L_X = 2.0 * 10^(40) erg/s and L_X = 6.6 * 10^(39)
erg/s for NGC 1313 X-1 and X-2 (0.2-10.0 keV, assuming a distance of 3.7 Mpc).
The spectra statistically require soft and hard spectral components to describe
the continuum emission; some prior studies of ULXs have claimed cool soft
components with lower statistics. The improvement over several single-component
models exceeds the 8 sigma level of confidence for X-1; the improvement for X-2
is significant at the 3 sigma level. The soft components in these ULX spectra
are well-fit by multi-color disk blackbody models with color temperatures of kT
= 150 eV. This temperature differs markedly from those commonly measured in the
spectra of stellar-mass (10 M_sun) black holes in their brightest states (kT ~
1 keV). It is expected that the temperature of an accretion disk orbiting a
black hole should decrease with increasing black hole mass. If the soft
components we measure are due to emission from the inner region of an accretion
disk, and disks extend close to the innermost stable circular orbit at the
accretion rates being probed, the low color temperatures may be interpreted as
spectroscopic evidence of black holes with intermediate masses: M_BH ~ 10^(3)
M_sun. Simple Eddington scaling arguments suggest a mimum mass of M_BH ~ 10^(2)
M_sun. NGC 1313 X-1 and X-2 are found in optical nebulae (Pakull and Mirioni

``shape-instability'', we have considered two types of axisymmetric clouds,
oblate and prolate clouds of various sizes and with axial ratios of $0.5 \leq
{R_{\rm c,R}} /{R_{\rm c,z}} \leq 2$. We find that the degree of oblateness or
prolateness is enhanced during the initial cooling phase. But it can be
reversed later, if the initial contrast in cooling times between the cloud gas
and the background gas is much greater than one. In such cases an oblate cloud
collapses to a structure composed of an outer thin disk and a central prolate
component. A prolate cloud, on the other hand, becomes a thin cigar-shape
structure with a central dense oblate component. The reversal of shape in the
central part of the cooled clouds is due to supersonic motions either along the
disk plane in the case of oblate clouds or along the symmetry axis in the case
of prolate clouds. For a background gas of $T_h=1.7\times 10^6$K and $n_h=0.1
\cm3$ in a protogalactic halo environment, the mean density of the cloud gas
that has cooled to $10^4$K increases to $100 n_h$ or so, in our simulations
where nonequilibrium cooling is adopted and the background gas cools too. The
spherical Jeans mass of such gas is estimated to be about $M_J \sim
5\times10^{7}\Msun$. In order for cloud mass to exceed the Jeans mass and at
the same time in order for the thermal instability to operate, the initial
cloud size should be around $1 - 1.5 l_{\rm cool}$ where $l_{\rm cool}$ is the
cooling length.

over-estimated by 20% if the cluster selection function is not accounted for
correctly. This helps to explain the wide range in sigma8 derived from
different techniques, sigma8~0.6-1, and offers a physically motivated
explanation for some of the discrepancy. We also identify two further
systematics in our analysis: (i) extrapolation of small field-of-view mass
measurements to the cluster virial radius and (ii) projection of 3-dimensional
masses contained in numerical simulations to the 2-dimensional information that
is available from observations. We combine quantitative estimates of these two
effects with our model fitting to estimate from the current data that
sigma8=0.75+/-0.05(statistical)+/-0.15(systematic), where the systematic error
reflects the extrapolation and projection uncertainties. All three systematics
(substructure, extrapolation and projection) are fundamental to future
cluster-based measurements of sigma8 regardless of the techniques employed.
However, we identify gravitational lensing as the tool of choice for such
studies, because a combination of strong- and weak-lensing offers the most
direct route to control the systematics and thus achieve an unbiased comparison

branes in extra-dimensions, carrying fermionic currents.
  The general framework in which these objects may appear is presented in the
first part while the second part is devoted to the dynamic of cosmic strings, a
class of topological defects of uttermost importance to modern cosmology, as it
can be obtained from a macroscopic covariant formalism. This formalism offers a
unified description of cosmic strings, including the case for which they carry
internal currents, and allows the study of their cosmological evolution, and
implications, by means of numerical simulations. Its validity has already been
confirmed for cosmic string carrying bosonic currents, and the third part
provides new results concerning the fermionic currents case. First, the fermion
mass spectrum in a cosmic string is computed, and suggests that fermionic
currents are usually built on massive propagation modes leading to a new
equation of state. This highlights that the usual one parameter macroscopic
formalism is not always sufficient in case of fermionic currents. Moreover,
contrary to the bosonic case, the dynamics stemming from this equation of state
exhibits transitions between the subsonic and supersonic regimes whose
consequences in cosmology could be important. The last part is an extension of
these results to brane cosmology for which our universe is viewed as a four
dimensional domain wall embedded in a five dimensional space-time. In the
framework of the Randall-Sundrum model, the masses of the trapped fermions on
the brane can be predicted.

profound consequences for the renormalizability of the theory. In particular,
renormalizability fails in any nonsupersymmetric noncommutative gauge theory.
In fact, we argue that renormalizability generally fails in any noncommutative
theory that allows quantum corrections beyond one-loop. Thus, it seems that
noncommutative quantum theories are extremely sensitive to the UV, and only the
softest UV behavior can be tolerated.

gamma p --> pi+ n reactions at center of mass angle of 90 degree in the photon
energy range from 1.1 to 5.5 GeV at Jefferson Lab (JLab). The data at photon
energies greater than 3.3 GeV exhibit a global scaling behavior for both pi-
and pi+ photoproduction, consistent with the constituent counting rule and the
existing pi+ photoproduction data. Possible oscillations around the scaling
value are suggested by these new data The data show enhancement in the scaled
cross section at a center-of-mass energy near 2.2 GeV. The cross section ratio
of exclusive pi- to pi+ photoproduction at high energy is consistent with the
prediction based on one-hard-gluon-exchange diagrams.

to model and important to accurately simulate. Using analytic signal theory and
an extension of the skin effect for non-uniform conductivity, experimental data
taken from IEEE 1394-1995 cables and connectors is used to predict the transfer
function of a 4.5 meter cable with two connectors. With these techniques any
length of cable between two connectors can be simulated with high accuracy,
including all the cable and connector losses and the infinitely summed standing
waves that occur between the connectors.

  Society of Japan",,,,"physics.chem-ph physics.atom-ph",,"  The rate constants for recombination and exchange processes are studied in
terms of two different flux correlation approaches: one is the Yamamoto
approach, which is based on the linear response theory, and the other is the
Miller one. Using those approaches we consider two exactly solvable cases,
i.e., the free particle and the parabolic potential models. Since the rate
constants for recombination and exchange processes are calculated by Laplace
transforms of the flux correlation functions, the two approaches give different
results. In the present calculation, we find that the rate constant in the
Yamamoto approach is larger than that in the Miller approach by about 40% at
low temperature ($\sim 100$ K) and high pressure ($\sim 1$ GPa). The difference
is considerable in the region where quantum effects dominate.

trapped atoms, whose internal degrees of freedom are driven in a
$\Lambda$-shaped configuration with the lasers tuned at two-photon resonance.
In the Lamb-Dicke regime, when the motional wave packet is well localized over
the laser wavelenght, transient coherent population trapping occurs, cancelling
transitions at the laser frequency. In this limit the motion can be efficiently
cooled to the ground state of the trapping potential. We derive an equation for
the center-of-mass motion by adiabatically eliminating the internal degrees of
freedom. This treatment provides the theoretical background of the scheme
presented in [G. Morigi {\it et al}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 85}, 4458 (2000)]
and implemented in [C.F. Roos {\it et al}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 85}, 5547

identify new parameters regimes, where cooling is efficient. We discuss
implementations of the scheme to cases where the trapping potential is not
harmonic.

satisfy the KS condition. The Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem then shows that these
theories are necessarily contextual. But the KS condition can be criticized
from an operational viewpoint, which suggests that a weaker condition (MGP)
should be adopted in place of it. This leads one to introduce a class of hidden
parameters theories in which contextuality can, in principle, be avoided, since
the proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem break down. A simple model
recently provided by the author for an objective interpretation of quantum
mechanics can be looked at as a noncontextual hidden parameters theory, which
shows that such theories actually exist.
