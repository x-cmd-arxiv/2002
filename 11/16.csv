of parsecs of Earth could have significant effects on the ozone layer. Since
that time, improved tools for detailed modeling of atmospheric chemistry have
been developed to calculate ozone depletion, and advances have been made in
theoretical modeling of supernovae and of the resultant gamma-ray spectra. In
addition, one now has better knowledge of the occurrence rate of supernovae in
the galaxy, and of the spatial distribution of progenitors to core-collapse
supernovae. We report here the results of two-dimensional atmospheric model
calculations that take as input the spectral energy distribution of a
supernova, adopting various distances from Earth and various latitude impact
angles. In separate simulations we calculate the ozone depletion due to both
gamma-rays and cosmic rays. We find that for the combined ozone depletion
roughly to double the ``biologically active'' UV flux received at the surface
of the Earth, the supernova must occur at <8 pc. Based on the latest data, the
time-averaged galactic rate of core-collapse supernovae occurring within 8 pc
is ~1.5/Gyr. In comparing our calculated ozone depletions with those of
previous studies, we find them to be significantly less severe than found by
Ruderman (1974), and consistent with Whitten et al. (1976). In summary, given
the amplitude of the effect, the rate of nearby supernovae, and the ~Gyr time
scale for multicellular organisms on Earth, this particular pathway for mass
extinctions may be less important than previously thought.

also were sought but not detected. The Fe XVIII feature, formed at log T (K) =

a C I multiplet. FUSE observations of these forbidden iron lines at spectral
resolution R ~ 15,000 provides the opportunity to study dynamics of hot coronal
plasmas. We find that the velocity centroid of the Fe XVIII feature deviates
little from the stellar rest frame, confirming that the hot coronal plasma is
confined. The observed line widths generally are consistent with thermal
broadening at the high temperatures of formation and show little indication of
additional turbulent broadening. The fastest rotating stars, 31 Com, alpha Aur
Ab, and AB Dor, show evidence for excess broadening beyond the thermal
component and the photospheric v sin i. The anomalously large widths in these
fast rotating targets may be evidence for enhanced rotational broadening
consistent with emission from coronal regions extending an additional delta R ~
0.4-1.3 R_star above the stellar photosphere or represent the turbulent
broadening caused by flows along magnetic loop structures. For the stars in
which Fe XVIII is detected, there is an excellent correlation between the

is presented here. It is assumed that the radio cocoon is poorly magnetically
connected to the environment. An extreme case of this kind is an insulating
boundary layer of magnetic fields, which can efficiently suppress particle
escape. More likely, magnetic field lines are less organised and allow the
transport of CR particles from the source interior to the surface region. For
such a scenario two transport regimes are analysed: diffusion of particles
along inter-phase magnetic flux tubes (leaving the cocoon) and cross field
transport of particles in flux tubes touching the cocoon surface. The cross
field diffusion is likely the dominate escape path, unless a significant
fraction of the surface is magnetically connected to the environment. Major
cluster merger should strongly enhance the particle escape by two complementary
mechanisms. i) The merger shock waves shred radio cocoons into filamentary
structures, allowing the CRs to easily reach the radio cocoon boundary due to
the changed morphology. ii) Also efficient particle losses can be expected for
radio cocoons not compressed in shock waves. There, for a short period after
the sudden injection of large scale turbulence, the (anomalous) cross field
diffusion can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude. This lasts until the
turbulent energy cascade has reached the microscopic scales, which determine
the value of the microscopic diffusion coefficients.

current theories of heating and cooling in cool diffuse clouds; in the main
they do not recombine with free electrons. This alters the ionization balance
by depressing n(H+) and n(He+) while carbon generally remains nearly fully
once-ionized: charge exchange with atomic oxygen and formation of H2 and OH
also depress n(H+) in partly molecular gas. Seemingly restrictive empirical
limits on the cosmic ray ionization rate of hydrogen ($\zeta_H$) are relaxed
and faster rates are favored in a wide range of circumstances, when grain
neutralization is recognized. Maintenance of the proton density at levels
needed to reproduce observations of HD requires $\zeta_H$ at least 2x10^{-16}
s^{-1}, but such models naturally explain the presence of both HD and H3^+ in
relatively tenuous H I clouds. In dense gas, a higher ionization rate can
account for high observed fractions of atomic hydrogen, and recognition of the
effects of grain neutralization can resolve a major paradox in the formation of
sulfur-bearing compounds.

Many young star clusters can be identified in the tails of UGC 10214, with ages
ranging from ~3 Myr to 10 Myr. The extreme blue V-I (F606W-F814W) colors of the
star clusters found in the tail of UGC 10214 can only be explained if strong
emission lines are included with a young stellar population. This has been
confirmed by our Keck spectroscopy of some of these bright blue stellar knots.
The most luminous and largest of these blue knots has an absolute magnitude of
M_V = -14.45, with a half-light radius of 161 pc, and if it is a single star
cluster, would qualify as a super star cluster (SSC). Alternatively, it could
be a superposition of multiple scaled OB associations or clusters. With an
estimated age of ~ 4-5 Myr, its derived mass is < 1.3 x 10^6 solar masses. Thus
the young stellar knot is unbound and will not evolve into a normal globular
cluster. The bright blue clusters and associations are much younger than the
dynamical age of the tail, providing strong evidence that star formation occurs
in the tail long after it was ejected. UGC 10214 provides a nearby example of
processes that contributed to the formation of halos and intra-cluster media in
the distant and younger Universe.

seems to be shifted to longer wavelengths and have a broader width although the
precise estimate of the feature profile is difficult. As a carrier for the
interstellar 100um feature, we investigate the possibility that the feature
originates from carbon onions, grains consisting of curved graphitic shells.
Because of the curved graphitic sheet structure, the optical properties in the
direction parallel to the graphitic plane interacts with those in the vertical
direction in carbon onion grains. This effect enhances the interband transition
feature in the direction parallel to the graphitic plane in carbon onions,
which is suppressed in graphite particles. Simple calculations suggest that
carbon onion grains are a likely candidate for the observed 100um feature
carrier, but the appearance of the feature is sensitive to the assumed optical
properties.

concentrated on determining ground-state arrangements of ions on the underlying

studies of short- and long-range correlations between electrons, and between
ions and electrons, and of the spatial decay of electron correlations (decay of
single-particle density matrix), in the ground state. The studies have been
carried out analytically and by means of well-controlled numerical procedures.
In the case of period 2 ground state, the single-particle density matrix has
been expressed in terms of a hypergeometric function, and its spatial decay has
been extracted. Numerical calculations have been done for open chains of
various lengths (up to a few thousand sites), in order to control the
chain-size dependence of correlations and to extrapolate the results to the
limit of infinite chain. A part of the obtained results refers to tight-binding
electrons subjected to a periodic external potential due to the ions, which

descriptions of different particles using both soft and hard interactions. We
find that in all three model systems many commonly used integrators may give
rise to surprisingly pronounced artifacts in physical observables such as the
radial distribution function, the compressibility, and the tracer diffusion
coefficient. The artifacts are found to be strongest in systems, where
interparticle interactions are soft and predominated by random and dissipative

are weaker. Our results suggest that the quality of any integration scheme
employed is crucial in all cases where the role of random and dissipative

freedom in our universe by open strings, as suggested by the braneworld
scenario. We focus on the geometric effects described by the open string metric
and investigate their observational implications. The causal structure of
spacetime on the brane is altered; it is described not by the usual metric
$g_{\mu\nu}$, but instead by the open string metric, that incorporates the
electromagnetic background, $G_{\mu\nu} = g_{\mu\nu} - (2\pi \alpha^\prime)^2
(F^2)_{\mu\nu}$. The speed of light is now slower when propagating along
directions transverse to electromagnetic fields or an NS-NS two form, so that
Lorentz invariance is explicitly broken. A generalized equivalence principle
guarantees that the propagation of {\it all} particles, not just photons, (with
the exception of gravitons) is slower in these transverse directions. We
describe a variety of astrophysical and laboratory-based experiments designed
to detect the predicted variations in the causal structure. We show that
current technology cannot probe beyond open string lengths of $10^{-13}$ cm,
corresponding to MeV string scales. We also point out that in a braneworld
scenario, constraints on large scale electromagnetic fields together with a
modest phenomenological bound on the NS-NS two-form naturally lead to a bound
on the scale of canonical noncommutativity that is two orders of magnitude
below the string length. By invoking theoretical constraints on the NS-NS
two-form this bound can be improved to give an extremely strong bound on the
noncommutative scale well below the Planck length, $\sqrt{|\theta|_{max}} <

all or a major component of the cold dark matter of the universe. The late
infall of axions, and of any other cold dark matter particles, onto our galaxy
produces streams and caustics in its halo. The outer caustics are topological
spheres whereas the inner caustics are rings. The self-similar model of
galactic halo formation predicts that the caustic ring radii $a_n$ obey the
approximate law $a_n \sim 1/n$. Evidence for this law has been found in a
statistical study of 32 extended and well-measured external galactic rotation
curves, and in the existence and distribution of sharp rises in the Milky Way
rotation curve. Moreover, a triangular feature in the IRAS map of the Galactic
plane is consistent with the imprint of a ring caustic upon the baryonic
matter. Its position coincides with a rise in the rotation curve, the one
nearest to us. These observations imply that the dark matter in our
neighborhood is dominated by a single flow. Estimates of that flow's density

choices into two classes, denoted by alpha and beta, and show them to be
related by T-duality. The distinction between them is formulated topologically
and hinges on some unique properties of 4d manifolds. We determine what their
parameter spaces of gauging are under certain simplicity ansatz for generic
flat spaces (R^4 and its toroidal compactifications) as well as some curved
spaces. We briefly discuss the spectra of D-branes for both alpha and beta
families.

trapping potentials are most easily obtained when the system may exchange
energy and particles with a large reservoir (grand-canonical ensemble). There
are circumstances, however, where the system under consideration may be
considered as being isolated (micro-canonical ensemble). This paper first
reviews results relating to micro-canonical ensembles. Some of them were
obtained a long time ago, particularly by Khinchin in 1950. Others were
obtained only recently, often motivated by experimental results relating to
atomic confinement. A number of formulas are reported for the first time in the
present paper. Formulas applicable to the case where the system may exchange
energy but not particles with a reservoir (canonical ensemble) are derived from
the micro-canonical ensemble expressions. The differences between the three
ensembles tend to vanish in the so-called Thermodynamics limit, that is, when
the number of particles and the volume go to infinity while the particle number
density remains constant. But we are mostly interested in systems of moderate
size, often referred to as being mesoscopic, where the grand-canonical
formalism is not applicable. The mathematical results rest primarily on the
enumeration of partitions of numbers.

left-invariant metric. To show this we explicitly determine the possible
local-isometry types of manifolds that have the properties named above, but are
not locally symmetric.

renormalization group transformations of Gibbs measures or joint measures of
disordered spin systems. We first show existence of the relative entropy
density and obtain a familiar expression in terms of entropy and relative
energy for ""almost Gibbsian measures"" (almost sure continuity of conditional
probabilities). We also describe these measures as equilibrium states and
establish an extension of the usual variational principle. As a corollary, we
obtain a full variational principle for quasilocal measures. For the joint
measures of the random field Ising model, we show that the weak Gibbs property
holds, with an almost surely rapidly decaying translation invariant potential.
For these measures we show that the variational principle fails as soon as the
measures loses the almost Gibbs property. These examples suggest that the class
of weakly Gibbsian measures is too broad from the perspective of a reasonable
thermodynamic formalism.

of a model based on ""selfish"" agents which play the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD)
game is studied. The agents have no memory and use strategies not based on
direct reciprocity nor 'tags'. Two variables are assigned to each agent $i$ at
time $t$, measuring its capital $C(i;t)$ and its probability of cooperation
$p(i;t)$. At each time step $t$ a pair of agents interact by playing the PD
game. These 2 agents update their probability of cooperation $p(i)$ as follows:
they compare the profits they made in this interaction $\delta C(i;t)$ with an
estimator $\epsilon(i;t)$ and, if $\delta C(i;t) \ge \epsilon(i;t)$, agent $i$
increases its $p(i;t)$ while if $\delta C(i;t) < \epsilon(i;t)$ the agent
decreases $p(i;t)$. The 4!=24 different cases produced by permuting the four
Prisoner's Dilemma canonical payoffs 3, 0, 1, and 5 -
corresponding,respectively, to $R$ (reward), $S$ (sucker's payoff), $T$
(temptation to defect) and $P$ (punishment) - are analyzed. It turns out that
for all these 24 possibilities, after a transient,the system self-organizes
into a stationary state with average equilibrium probability of cooperation
$\bar{p}_\infty$ = constant $ > 0$.Depending on the payoff matrix, there are
different equilibrium states characterized by their average probability of
cooperation and average equilibrium per-capita-income
($\bar{p}_\infty,\bar{\delta C}_\infty$).

realisations, giving rise to omnipresent dynamic randomness and universally
defined complexity (arXiv:physics/9806002). Since quantum behaviour dynamically
emerges as the lowest complexity level (arXiv:quant-ph/9902016), quantum
interaction randomness can only be relatively strong, which reveals the causal
origin of quantum indeterminacy (arXiv:quant-ph/9511037) and true quantum chaos
(arXiv:quant-ph/9511035), but rigorously excludes the possibility of unitary
quantum computation, even in an ""ideal"", noiseless system. Any real computation
is an internally chaotic (multivalued) process of system complexity development
occurring in different regimes. Unitary quantum machines, including their
postulated ""magic"", cannot be realised as such because their dynamically
single-valued scheme is incompatible with the irreducibly high dynamic
randomness at quantum complexity levels and should be replaced by explicitly
chaotic, intrinsically creative machines already realised in living organisms
and providing their quite different, realistic kind of magic. The related
concepts of reality-based, complex-dynamical nanotechnology, biotechnology and
intelligence are outlined, together with the ensuing change in research
strategy. The unreduced, dynamically multivalued solution to the many-body
problem reveals the true, complex-dynamical basis of solid-state dynamics,
including the origin and internal dynamics of macroscopic quantum states. The
critical, ""end-of-science"" state of unitary knowledge and the way to positive
change are causally specified within the same, universal concept of complexity.
