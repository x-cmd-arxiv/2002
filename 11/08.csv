the equations of motion that remains close to the numerical solution for a long
time. In a collisionless n-body system, we know that particle motion is
governed by the global potential rather than by inter-particle interactions. As
a result, the trajectory of each individual particle in the system is
independently shadowable. It is thus meaningful to measure the number of
particles that have shadowable trajectories as a function of time. We find that
the number of shadowable particles decays exponentially with time as exp(-mu
t), and that for eps in [~0.2,1] (in units of the local mean inter-particle
separation $\bar n$), there is an explicit relationship between the decay
constant mu, the timestep h of the leapfrog integrator, the softening eps, and
the number of particles N in the simulation. Thus, given N and eps, it is
possible to pre-compute the timestep h necessary to acheive a desired fraction
of shadowable particles after a given length of simulation time. We demonstrate
that a large fraction of particles remain shadowable over ~100 crossing times
even if particles travel up to about 1/3 of the softening length per timestep.
However, a sharp decrease in the number of shadowable particles occurs if the
timestep increases to allow particles to travel further than 1/3 the softening
length in one timestep, or if the softening is decreased below ~0.2$\bar n$.

into point sources. The IGM around these sources is demonstrably not dense and
hot. We conclude that radio sources are not reliable signposts of massive
clusters at moderate redshifts. X-ray synchrotron emission could explain the
radio, optical, and X-ray hot spot fluxes in 3C280, but it would require
continuous acceleration of electrons to high Lorentz factors, since the
synchrotron lifetime required to produce the X-ray emission is of order a human
lifetime. SSC with or without IC scattering of the CMB can also explain the

swamps the disc even in the ultraviolet band where disc emission peaks. In this
paper we estimate the accretion disc component for 136 flat-spectrum radio
quasars selected from the Deep X-ray Radio Blazar Survey. We do this by
deriving the accretion disc spectrum from the mass and accretion rate onto the
central black hole for each object, estimated using the emission line widths
and the power emitted from the broad line region. We find that non-thermal
emission dominates the optical/UV band of our sources. The thermal component,
in fact, is, on average, ~ 15 per cent of the total and > 90 per cent of the
objects in the sample have a thermal component < 0.5 of the total luminosity.
We then estimate the integrated disc and kinetic jet powers and find that, on
average, the disc luminosity is ~ 1 to 20 times the jet power (depending on the
uncertainties in the estimation of the latter quantity). A comparison with
previous, independent results favours a scenario in which jet and disk powers
are of the same order of magnitude. Extraction of energy from a rotating black
hole via the ``Blandford-Znajek'' mechanism fails to explain the estimated jet
power in the majority of our sources. Finally, we find that the typical masses
for our sources are ~ 5 10^8 solar masses and that, contrary to previous
claims, about one quarter of our radio quasars have relatively small (< 3 10^8
solar masses) black hole mass.

required tensile strength of ~10^5 dyn/cm^2 is consistent with the sticking
forces observed in laboratory simulations of frosted ice particles. These
assemblies could be the nonlinear outcome of a linear instability that occurs
in a rotating fluid disk in which the shear stress is a decreasing function of
the shear. We show that a simple model of an incompressible, non-Newtonian
fluid in shear flow leads to the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which is widely used
to model the formation of structure in binary alloys and other systems.

superfluids. This instability is similar to the two-stream instability known to
operate in plasmas. It is analogous to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, but
has the distinguishing feature that the two fluids are interpenetrating. The
instability sets in once the relative flow between the two components of the
system reaches a critical level. Our analysis is based on the two-fluid
equations that have been used to model the dynamics of the outer core of a
neutron star, where superfluid neutrons are expected to coexist with
superconducting protons and relativistic electrons. These equations are
analogous to the standard Landau model for superfluid Helium. We study this
instability for two different model problems. First we analyze a local
dispersion relation for waves in a system where one fluid is at rest while the
other flows at a constant rate. This provides a proof of principle of the
existence of the two-stream instability for superfluids. Our second model
problem concerns two rotating fluids confined within an infinitesimally thin
spherical shell. The aim of this model is to assess whether the two-stream
instability may be relevant (perhaps as a trigger mechanism) for pulsar
glitches. Our results for this problem show that the entrainment effect could
provide a sufficiently strong coupling for the instability to set in at a

of several chemical elements (H, D, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Fe, Ni and Zn)
for elliptical, spiral and irregular galaxies. Each of the models is calibrated
to reproduce the main features of a massive elliptical, the Milky Way and the
LMC, respectively. In addition, we run some models also for dwarf irregular
starburst galaxies. All the models share the same uptodate nucleosynthesis
prescriptions but differ in their star formation histories. The role of SNe of
different type (II, Ia) is studied in each galaxy model together with detailed
and up to date nucleosynthesis prescriptions. Our main conclusions are: 1) when
dust depletion is taken into account most of the claimed alpha/Fe
overabundances disappear and DLAs show solar or subsolar abundance ratios. 2)
The majority of DLAs can be explained either by disks of spirals observed at
large galactocentric distances or by irregular galaxies like the LMC or by
starburst dwarf irregulars observed at different times after the last burst of
star formation. 3) Elliptical galaxies cannot be DLA systems since they reach a
too high metallicity at early times and their abundance ratios show
overabundances of $\alpha$-elements relative to Fe over a large range of
[Fe/H]. 4) The observed neutral gas cosmic evolution is compared with our

taken in 1999 and 2000. The dominant feature of our R-band light curve is the
ellipsoidal modulation of the secondary star, however, in order to fit this
satisfactorily we require additional components which comprise an X-ray heated
Roche-lobe filling secondary star, and an accretion disk bulge, i.e. where the
gas stream impacts the accretion disk. The observed dip near phase 0.8 is
interpreted as the eclipse of inner parts of the accretion disk by the bulge.
This scenario is highly plausible given the high binary inclination. Our fits
allow us to constrain the size of the quiescent accretion disk to lie in the
range 0.26-0.56R_L1 (68% confidence). Using the distance of 9.6 kpc and the
X-ray flux inferred from the heated hemisphere of the companion, we obtain an
unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of 1.2x10^33 erg/s for XTE J2123-058 in quiescence.
  From the observed quiescent optical/IR colors we find that the power-law
index (-1.4) for the spectral distribution of the accretion disk compares well
with other quiescent X-ray transients. We also re-analyse the optical light
curves of the soft X-ray transient XTE J2123-058 taken during its outburst and
decay in 1998. We use a robust method to fit the data using a refined X-ray
binary model. The model computes the light arising from a Roche-lobe filling
star and flared accretion disk irradiated by X-rays, and calculates the effects
of shadowing and mutual star/disk eclipses. We obtain relatively accurate
values for the binary inclination and mass ratio, which when combined with

selection function. We also establish the mapping between the DWT one-point

the DWT one-point statistics from the redshift distortion of bulk velocity,
velocity dispersion, and selection function. Numerical tests on N-body
simulation samples show that this algorithm works well on scales from a few
hundreds to a few Mpc/h for four popular cold dark matter models.
  Taking the advantage that the DWT one-point variable is dependent on both the
scale and the shape (configuration) of decomposition modes, one can design
estimators of the redshift distortion parameter (beta) from combinations of DWT
modes. When the non-linear redshift distortion is not negligible, the beta
estimator from quadrupole-to-monopole ratio is a function of scale. This
estimator would not work without adding information about the scale-dependence,
such as the power-spectrum index or the real-space correlation function of the
random field. The DWT beta estimators, however, do not need such extra
information. Numerical tests show that the proposed DWT estimators are able to
determine beta robustly with less than 15% uncertainty in the redshift range 0

connections from high redshift to the present day. First, we give a historical
review on some basic ideas related to the starburst-AGN connection published in
the literature. Second, we focus our attention to the so-called Magorrian
relation which is the close relationship between the nuclear black hole mass
and the bulge mass, established in nearby galaxies. If the Magorrian relation
is universal, we obtain an important implication that any supermassive black
holes were made through successive merging processes of starburst remnants
(i.e., neutron stars and stellar-sized black holes), providing a channel of the
starburst-AGN connection. Third, we briefly discuss a possible new scenario for
the formation of quasar nuclei at very high redshift based on an idea that the
successive mergers of starburst remnants formed in subgalactic gaseous clouds.

examined within the context of a specific model of such high energy gamma ray

protons to be accelerated to ultrahigh energies $\gsim10^{20}\ev$ within GRBs.
In this model, the high energy component is distinct from, but may well be
emitted in coincidence with, the usual ``low'' (keV--MeV) energy component
observed by satellite-borne detectors. The AMANDA/ICECUBE detectors can detect
TeV photons by detecting the secondary muons created by the TeV photons in the
Earth's atmosphere. We calculate the muon signal to noise ratio in these
detectors due to TeV gamma-rays from individual GRBs for various assumptions on
their luminosity, distance (redshift), Lorentz Gamma factor of the underlying
fireball model, and various spectral characteristics of the GRBs, including the
effect of the absorption of TeV photons within the GRB as well as in the
intergalactic infrared radiation background. The intergalactic absorption
effect essentially precludes detection of TeV photons in the AMANDA detector
for reasonable values of the luminosity in the high energy component, but they
may well be detectable in the proposed ICECUBE detector which may have an
effective area for downward-going muons a factor of 100 larger than that in
AMANDA. However, even in ICECUBE, only relatively close-by GRBs at redshifts $<
0.05$ or so can be expected to be detectable with any reasonable degree of

Published models of the infrared SEDs imply that a starburst and obscured
quasar contribute equally to the power of each source.
  IRAS F12514+1027 (z=0.30) is detected in 18.6 ks with 130 EPIC-pn counts over
0.2-12 keV. The soft X-ray spectrum exhibits thermal emission from the
starburst, with T=0.3 keV and L(0.5-2.0keV)=2.1E42 erg/s. With its Fe K-edge,
the flat continuum above 2 keV is interpreted as cold reflection from a hidden
AGN with an intrinsic L(2-10keV) of at least 1.8E44 erg/s. Comparison with the
infrared power requires that the X-ray reflector subtend ~2pi/5 sr at the
central engine. IRAS F00235+1024 (z=0.575) is not detected by the EPIC-pn in
15.9 ks; the limits imply that the starburst is X-ray weak, and (for the AGN)
that any hard X-ray reflector subtend <2pi/5 sr. The direct lines of sight to
the AGN in both objects are Compton-thick, and the presence of a reflection
component in F12514+1027, but not in F00235+1024, suggests that the AGN in the
latter object is more completely obscured. This is consistent with their
Seyfert-2 and starburst optical spectra, respectively.

sample show the deep mixing abundance pattern seen in nearly all globular
clusters. At a given metallicity, the dSph giants exhibit lower [el/Fe]
abundance ratios for the alpha elements than stars in the Galactic halo. This
can be caused by a slow star formation rate and contribution from Type Ia SN,
and/or a small star formation event (low total mass) and mass dependent Type II
SN yields. Differences in the even-Z [el/Fe] ratios between these galaxies, as
well as differences in the evolution of the s&r-process elements are
interpreted in terms of their star formation histories. Comparison of the dSph
abundances with those of the Galactic halo reveals some consistencies. In
particular, we find stars that mimic the abundance pattern found by Nissen &
Shuster (1997) for metal-rich, high R_max, high z_max halo stars, supporting
their suggestion that disrupted dSph's may explain up to 50% of the metal-rich
halo. A comparison with the metal-poor Galactic halo reveal no consistencies
suggesting that the majority of the metal-poor Galactic halo could not have
been formed from objects similar to these dSph. Finally, we use the dSph
abundances to place new constraints on the nucleosynthetic origins, including
Cu and Mn which are more consistent with metallicity dependent SN yields than
the more commonly assumed SN Ia production.

The best match is obtained using two fitting functions based on star counts in
the different bins of the cluster CMD. Two different criteria are used. One of
them takes into account the uncertainties in the color of the red clump stars.
Given the uncertainties on the experimental values of the clusters metallicity,
we provide a set of acceptable solutions. They define the correspondent values
of metallicity, age, reddening and distance modulus (for the assumed IMF). The
comparison with Padova models suggests for NGC 2173 a prolonged star formation
(spanning a period of about 0.3 Gyr), beginning 1.7 Gyr and ending 1.4 Gyr ago.
The metallicity Z is in the range 0.0016 $-$ 0.003. Contrary to what suggested
for NGC 2173 a period of extended star formation was not required to fit the SL
556 and the NGC 2155 observations. For SL 556 an age of 2.0 Gyr is obtained.
The metallicity value is in the range 0.002 $-$ 0.004, depending on the adopted
comparison criterium. The derived age for NGC 2155 is 2.8 Gyr and its
metallicity Z is in the range 0.002 $-$ 0.003. The CMD features of this cluster
suggest that a more efficient overshoot should be adopted in the evolutionary
models.

synthesized via the p-process in supernova-driven supercritical accretion disks

is the Eddington luminosity. Abundance profiles of p-nuclei ejected from SSADs
have similar feature to those of the oxygen/neon layers in Type II supernovae
when the abundance of the fallback gas far from the compact object is that of
the oxygen/neon layers in the progenitor. The overall abundance profile is in
agreement with that of the solar system. Some p-nuclei, such as Mo, Ru, Sn, and
La, are underproduced in the SSADs as in Type II supernovae. If the fallback
gas is mixed with a small fraction of proton through Rayleigh-Taylor
instability during the explosion, significant amounts of Mo92 are produced
inside the SSADs. Ru96 and La138 are also produced when the fallback gas
contains abundant proton though the overall abundance profile of p-nuclei is

derived via three different methods (the ``direct'' method, the empirical
method guided by photoionization modeling of McGaugh (1991), and the purely
empirical method of Pilyugin (2000)) and are compared. Significant systematic
differences are found between the three methods, and we suggest that a
recalibration of the empirical abundance scale is required. The N/O ratio for
the metal-poor dI ESO 473-G24 of log (N/O) = -1.43 +/- 0.03 lies well above the
plateau of log (N/O) = -1.60 +/- 0.02 found by Izotov & Thuan (1999) for a
collection of metal-poor blue compact galaxies. This shows that not all
galaxies with 12 + log (O/H) < 7.6 have identical elemental abundance ratios,
and this implies that the Izotov & Thuan scenario for low metallicity galaxies
is not universal. Measurements of the HII regions in NGC 625 yield log (N/O) =
-1.25. Assuming N production by intermediate mass stars, this relatively high
N/O ratio may be indicative of a long quiescent period prior to the recent
active burst of star formation. The oxygen abundances in the Sculptor Group dIs
are in good agreement with the relationship between metallicity and luminosity
observed in the Local Group dIs. The Sculptor Group dIs, in general, lie closer
to the simple closed box model evolutionary path than the Local Group dIs. The
higher gas contents, lower average star formation rates, and closer resemblance
to closed box evolution could all be indicative of evolution in a relatively
low density environment.

we show that the ferro-antiferromagnetic transition takes place in an
inhomogeneous way: around the critical concentration the sample is a mixture of
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions. The zero-field NMR measurements

the ST belongs to the directed percolation (DP) universality class. Spreading
dynamics confirms such an identification, only for a certain class of
synchronized configurations. For homogeneous configurations spreading exponents
$\eta$ and $\delta$ are different than DP exponents but their sum equals to the
corresponding sum of DP exponents. Such a relation is typical to some models
with infinitely many absorbing states. Moreover, we calculate the spreading
exponents for the tent map for which the ST belongs to the bounded
Kardar-Parisi-Zheng (BKPZ) universality class. Our estimation of spreading
exponents are consistent with the hyperscaling relation. Finally, we examine
the asymmetric tent map. For small asymmetry the ST remains of the BKPZ type.
However, for large asymmetry a different critical behaviour appears with
exponents being relatively close to the ones of DP.

the inspiral and coalescence of neutron star and black hole binaries, which, in
turn, are among the most promising sources of gravitational radiation for
future detection by gravitational wave observatories. In this article we review
numerical relativity approaches to modeling compact binaries. Starting with a
brief introduction to the 3+1 decomposition of Einstein's equations, we discuss
important components of numerical relativity, including the initial data
problem, reformulations of Einstein's equations, coordinate conditions, and
strategies for locating and handling black holes on numerical grids. We focus
on those approaches which currently seem most relevant for the compact binary
problem. We then outline how these methods are used to model binary neutron
stars and black holes, and review the current status of inspiral and
coalescence simulations.

product of chiral-odd distributions $h_1^\perp(x_1,\bm{p}_\perp^2)\times \bar
h_1^\perp(x_2,\bm{k}_\perp^2) $, where the quark-transversity function
$h_1^\perp(x,\bm{p}_\perp^2)$ is the transverse momentum dependent, light-cone
momentum distribution of transversely polarized quarks in an {\it unpolarized}
proton. We compute this (naive) $T$-odd and chiral-odd distribution function
and the resulting $\cos 2 \phi$ asymmetry explicitly in a quark-scalar diquark
model for the proton with initial-state gluon interaction. In this model the
function $h_1^\perp(x,\bm{p}_\perp^2)$ equals the $T$-odd (chiral-even) Sivers
effect function $f^\perp_{1T}(x,\bm{p}_\perp^2)$. This suggests that the
single-spin asymmetries in the SIDIS and the Drell-Yan process are closely
related to the $\cos 2 \phi$ asymmetry of the unpolarized Drell-Yan process,
since all can arise from the same underlying mechanism. This provides new
insight regarding the role of quark and gluon orbital angular momentum as well
as that of initial- and final-state gluon exchange interactions in hard QCD

the ``kinematic'' effects like thermal weighting of the states is sufficient,
in AA we see a clear effect of dynamical interaction with matter, both due to a
variety of s-channel resonances and due to t-channel scalar exchanges. The
particular quantity we focus mostly on is the $\rho$ meson mass, for which
these dynamical effects lead to about -50 MeV shift, on top of about -20 MeV of
a thermal effect: both agree well with preliminary data from STAR experiment at

(under a condition called geometric rationality by Casselman) yield
compactifications of the corresponding locally symmetric spaces. The different
compactifications depend on the choice of a representation of G. One example is
the Baily-Borel-Satake compactification of a Hermitian locally symmetric space;
Baily and Borel proved this is always geometrically rational. Satake
compactifications for which all the real boundary components are equal-rank
symmetric spaces are a natural generalization of the Baily-Borel-Satake
compactification. Recent work (see math.RT/0112250, math.RT/0112251) indicates
that this is the natural setting for many results about cohomology of
compactifications of locally symmetric spaces. In this paper we prove any
Satake compactification for which all the real boundary components are
equal-rank symmetric spaces is geometrically rational aside from certain
rational rank 1 or 2 exceptions; we completely analyze geometric rationality
for these exceptional cases. The proof uses Casselman's criterion for geometric
rationality. We also prove that a Satake compactification is geometrically
rational if the representation is defined over the rational numbers.

boundary condition, F_h is the boundary integral operator induced by the double
layer potential. We show that F_h is a semiclassical Fourier integral operator
quantizing the billiard map plus a `small' remainder. We then use the quantum
dyanmics defined by F_h at the boundary to prove the result, much as the
quantum dynamics generated by the wave group were exploited in the work of
Zelditch-Zworski (1996). Novelties include the facts that F_h is not unitary
and (consequently) the boundary values are equidistributed by measures which
are not invariant under the billiard map and which depend on the boundary
conditions.

characterized by a set of parameters that serve to make iterated predictions of
two successive returns. The future price is determined according to the offer

among the agents in each trading cycle. Without noise the dynamics of this
system is nearly regular and thereby fails to reproduce the stochastic return
fluctuations observed in real markets. However, when in each cycle a small
amount of noise is introduced we find the typical features of real financial
time series like fat-tails of the return distribution and large temporal
correlations in the volatility without significant correlations in the price
returns. Introducing the noise by an evolutionary process leads to different
scalings of the return distributions that depend on the definition of fitness.
Because our realistic model has only very few parameters, and the results
appear to be robust with respect to the noise level and the number of agents we
expect that our framework may serve as new paradigm for modeling self generated
return fluctuations in markets.

Starting from the equations of motion of the map these correlations are
formulated in terms of fractal generalized Takagi functions obeying generalized

approach to the macroscopic limit. The quantum predictions are compared and
contrasted with the classical predictions of both Newtonian and Liouville
mechanics. The time-domain scaling of the optimal quantum-classical
correspondence is analyzed in detail in the case of both classical theories. In
both cases the correspondence for observable quantities is shown to break down
on a time-scale that increases very slowly (logarithmically) with increasing
system size. In the case of quantum-Liouville correspondence such a short
time-scale does not imply a breakdown of correspondence since the largest
quantum-Liouville differences reached on this time-scale decrease rapidly (as
an inverse power) with increasing system size. Therefore the statistical
properties of chaotic dynamics are, as expected, well described by quantum
theory in the macroscopic limit. In contrast, the largest quantum-Newtonian
differences reached on the log time-scale actually increase in proportion to
the system size. Since the invariance properties of the Hamiltonian impose
functional constraints on the time-varying chaotic coordinates, it is possible
to show, moreover, that if the quantum predictions are believed to describe the
coordinates of individual chaotic systems, then they also predict macroscopic
violations of any kinematic or dynamic constants of the motion. These results
for chaotic systems indicate that a valid description of the time-varying
properties of individual macroscopic bodies is not available within the

  The geodesic length spectrum for the Laplacian operator is extended to solve
the Schroedinger operator. Homotopy fundamental group representations are used
to obtain a direct sum of Hilbert spaces, with a Holonomy method for the non
simply connected manifolds.The covering spaces of isometric and hence
isospectral manifolds are used to obtain the representation of states on
orientable and non orientable spaces. Problems of deformations of the operators
and the domains are discussed.Possible applications of the geometric and
topological effects in physics are mentioned.

passage of a linear signal with arbitrary time dependence is derived.
Transition probabilities are simple to express in terms of Laguerre
polynomials. Spontaneous transitions are neglected. The exact result is of some
interest for the physics of short laser pulses, since it may serve as an
accuracy test for numerical methods.

symplectic and Heisenberg group representations, respectively. The Wigner
functions give a representation of the quantum system using classical
variables. The correspondence between the classical and the quantum criterion
of separability for the system is obtained in terms of these functions.
  Entanglement is generic and separability is special. Some applications are
discussed in commonly occuring examples and possibly in exotic systems.

mixed-state systems, create arbitrary superposition states and optimize the
ensemble average of dynamic observables.
