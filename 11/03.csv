there has been a significant breakthrough on the theory of magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) turbulence. For the first time we have a scaling model that is supported
by both observations and numerical simulations. We review recent progress in
studies of both incompressible and compressible turbulence. We compare

Kinematically, galaxy E is probably a component of the A+C complex; otherwise
it is a recently detached fragment. Galaxy F appears, both kinematically and
chemically, to have formed from material tidally removed from the A+C complex.
Galaxies B and G are kinematically distinct from this complex. Galaxy Q also
has a radial velocity compatible with group membership. Galaxies A, B, C, and F
have nearly identical oxygen abundances, despite spanning a luminosity range of
5$ $mag. Galaxy B's oxygen abundance is normal for its luminosity, while galaxy
F's abundance is that expected given its origin as a tidal fragment of the A+C
complex. The oxygen abundances in galaxies A and C are also understandable if
the A+C complex is a late-type spiral suffering strong gas inflow and star
formation as a result of a tidal interaction. Given the kinematics of both the
galaxies and the \ion{H}{i} gas, the oxygen abundances, and the position of
galaxy G, we propose that an interaction of galaxy G with the A+C complex,
rather than a merger of galaxies A and C, is a more complete explanation for
the tidal features and other properties of HCG31. In this case, the A+C complex
need not be a merger in progress, though this is not ruled out.

Anisotropic lattices are used in order to have sufficient numbers of degrees of
freedom in the Euclidean temporal direction. We focus on the low energy
structure of the spectral function, corresponding to the ground state in the
hadron phase, by applying the smearing technique to enhance the contribution to
the correlator from this region. We employ two analysis procedures: the maximum
entropy method (MEM) for the extraction of the spectral function without
assuming a specific form, to estimate the shape of the spectral function, and
the standard $\chi^2$ fit analysis using typical forms in accordance with the
result of MEM, for a more quantitative evaluation. To verify the applicability
of the procedures, we first analyze the smeared correlators as well as the
point correlators at zero temperature. We find that by shortening the
$t$-interval used for the analysis (a situation inevitable at $T>0$) the
reliability of MEM for point correlators is lost, while it subsists for smeared
correlators. Then the smeared correlators at $T\simeq 0.9 T_c$ and $1.1 T_c$
are analyzed. At $T\simeq 0.9 T_c$, the spectral function exhibits a strong
peak, well approximated by a delta function corresponding to the ground state
with almost the same mass as at T=0. At $T\simeq 1.1 T_c$, we find that the
strong peak structure still persists at almost the same place as below $T_c$,
but with a finite width of a few hundred MeV. This result indicates that the
correlators possess a nontrivial structure even in the deconfined phase.

cosmological phase transition during the radiation dominated era. The setting
is a theory of N charged scalar fields coupled to an abelian gauge field, that
undergoes a phase transition at a critical temperature much larger than the
electroweak scale. The dynamics after the transition features two distinct
stages: a spinodal regime dominated by linear long-wavelength instabilities,
and a scaling stage in which the non-linearities and backreaction of the scalar
fields are dominant. This second stage describes the growth of horizon sized
domains. We implement a recently introduced formulation to obtain the spectrum
of magnetic fields that includes the dissipative effects of the plasma. We find
that large scale magnetogenesis is very efficient during the scaling regime.
The ratio between the energy density on scales larger than L and that in the
background radiation r(L,T) = rho_B(L,T)/rho_{cmb}(T) is r(L,T) \sim 10^{-34}
at the Electroweak scale and r(L,T) \sim 10^{-14} at the QCD scale for L \sim 1

phase transition.
