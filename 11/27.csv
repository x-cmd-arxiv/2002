separate frequencies (hybrid and low branch) under the influence of the
gravitational forces in the rotational frame of reference. The observed low and
high QPO frequencies are an intrinsic signature of the RTGW. I elaborate the

comparison of the inferred QPO frequencies with QPO observations is presented.
I find that hectohertz frequencies detected from NS binaries can be identified

only force which acts in the rotational frame of reference and its presence
causes perfect coherent pulsations with a frequency twice of the NS spin.

X-ray PDS of black hole candidates in their low states, but with the
low-frequency break at a lower frequency. X-ray Nova Mus 1991 shows much larger
amplitude flares than A0620-00 and if a break is present it is at a lower

the flares. They are clearly associated with the accretion flow rather than an

relative shift in the dominance of HI and H$_2$ gas. A strong shock being fed
by diffuse HI clouds with unusually large ($>$ 400 km s$^{-1}$) rotational

star formation and off-nuclear molecular gas resulting from likely streaming

thick disk are distinct (this has previously been shown for Mg by Fuhrmann
1998, but e.g. Chen et al. 2000 claimed the trends to follow smoothly upon each
other). We find that the thick disk show the typical signature of contribution
from SN Ia (i.e. the ``knee'') to the enrichment of the interstellar gas out of
which the later generations of thick disk stars formed. The trend starts out as
[Mg/Fe] ~0.35 at [Fe/H] ~ -0.7 and continue on this level with increasing

down to 0 dex at solar metallicity. The same is true for the other

directly throw any light on the question of existence of flux tubes. We can,
however, draw important conclusions about flux tubes in the interior of the Sun
by combining additional arguments with the insights gained from solar dynamo
solutions. The polar magnetic field of the Sun is of order 10 G, whereas the
toroidal magnetic field at the bottom of the convection zone has been estimated
to be 100,000 G. Simple order-of-magnitude estimates show that the shear in the
tachocline is not sufficient to stretch a 10 G mean radial field into a 100,000
G mean toroidal field. We argue that the polar field of the Sun must get
concentrated into intermittent flux tubes before it is advected to the
tachocline. We estimate the strengths and filling factors of these flux tubes.
Stretching by shear in the tachocline is then expected to produce a highly
intermittent magnetic configuration at the bottom of the convection zone. The
meridional flow at the bottom of the convection zone should be able to carry
this intermittent magnetic field equatorward, as suggested recently by Nandy

$\sim$~2.2~\h~Mpc region of the galaxy cluster Abell~521 (z=0.247), based on
238 spectra obtained at the 3.6~m Telescope of ESO and at the CFHT. From the
analysis of the 125 galaxies confirmed members of the cluster, we derive a mean
velocity of $74019 ^{+112}_{-125}$ km/s and detect a complex velocity
distribution with high velocity dispersion, $1325 ^{+145}_{-100}$ km/s), but
clear departure from a single gaussian component. The general structure of the
cluster follows a NW/SE direction, crossed by a perpendicular high density
``ridge'' of galaxies in the core region. The northern region of the cluster is
characterized by a lower velocity dispersion as compared to the whole cluster
value; it hosts the BCG and a dynamically bound complex of galaxies, and it is
associated to a group detected in X-ray (Arnaud et al 2000). This region could
be in pre-merger stage onto the main cluster nearly in the plane of the sky.
These results, taken together with the fact that most of the clumps detected on
the isodensity maps, as well as the early type galaxies and the brightest ones
are aligned, suggest that this NW/SE direction is the preferred one for the
formation of this cluster. The central high dense region shows a lower velocity
location ($73625 ^{+344}_{-350}$ km/s) and significantly higher scale ($1780
^{+234}_{-142}$ km/s) as compared to the whole cluster values. This is due to
the presence of a low-velocity group of galaxies with a high fraction of
emission line objects. This can be explained in a scenario in which a merging
of subclusters has recently occurred along the direction of the ``ridge'' with
a significant component along the line of sight.

the mass flow rates of disk wind and stellar wind. The maximum speed of the

beam epitaxy (MBE) and related methods of crystal growth like atomic layer
epitaxy (ALE) can be performed. Besides detailed models of reconstructed (001)
surfaces of II-VI semiconductors like CdTe and ZnSe, we study generic models to
adress fundamental properties of epitaxial growth like kinetic roughening and
the coarsening of mounds.
  A lattice gas model of flat (001) surfaces of CdTe and ZnSe in thermal
equilibrium suggest an interpretation of the transition between a c(2x2)
reconstruction at low temperature and a (2x1) reconstruction at high
temperature as an encompanying effect of an order-disorder phase transition. We
extend this lattice gas model to models of three-dimensional crystals. Using
one of these models, we have performed the (to the best of our knowledge) first
simulations of ALE.
  We apply the WTMM method to investigate the scaling properties of kinetically
rough surfaces obtained by the simulation of MBE growth on the surface of a
simple cubic crystal. Our results support a generalization of Family-Vicsek
scaling. We show, that this is the most general scaling behaviour if dynamic
scale invariance is fulfilled and a correlation length is the only relevant
lengthscale of the surface.
  Finally, we consider the coarsening of mounds on surfaces of crystals having
different lattice structures. We find, contrary to the results of a continuum
theory of Siegert et. al. and Golubovic et. al., that the dynamic exponents are
independent of the surface symmetry.

the fully frustrated array, quenched to low temperature ordered states or
quasi-ordered ones, is dominated by characteristic features of coarsening
processes via decay of point and line defects, respectively. In the case of
unfrustrated arrays, it is argued that due to finiteness of the friction
constant for a vortex (in the limit of large spatial extent of the vortex), the
typical length scale grows as $\ell_s \sim t^{1/2}$ accompanied by the number
of point vortices decaying as $N_v \sim 1/t $. This is in contrast with the
case that dominant dissipation occurs between each island and the substrate,
where the friction constant diverges logarithmically and the length scale
exhibits diffusive growth with a logarithmic correction term. We perform
extensive numerical simulations, to obtain results in reasonable agreement. In
the case of fully frustrated arrays, the domain growth of Ising-like chiral
order exhibits the low-temperature behavior $\ell_q \sim t^{1/z_q}$, with the

bounds: the SSS and WF approximations are lower and upper bounds, respectively,

approximation requires an effective diffusion coefficient 10 to 100 times
smaller than expected to fit experimentally measured quenching rates. An all
atom molecular dynamics simulation of an eleven residue peptide sequence in
explicit water is analyzed to investigate the source of this surprising
parameter value. In analytical work, the polymer is typically modeled by a
Gaussian chain of effective monomers. Compared to Gaussian dynamics, the
simulated end-to-end distance autocorrelation has a much slower relaxation. The
long time behavior of the distance autocorrelation function can be approximated
by a Gaussian model in which the monomer diffusion coefficient D_0 is reduced

of cooperators organized in small non-stationary domains or in small clusters.

the effects of incoherent surface state electron scattering at the impurities

have been used to study the well-known order-disorder transition (ODT) to the
beta phase in poly(9,9-(di n,n-octyl)fluorene)) (PF8) thin film samples through
combination of time-dependent and temperature-dependent measurements. The ODT
is well described by a simple Avrami picture of one-dimensional nucleation and
growth but crystallization, on cooling, proceeds only after molecular-level
conformational relaxation to the so called beta phase. Rapid thermal quenching
is employed for PF8 studies of pure alpha phase samples while extended
low-temperature annealing is used for improved beta phase formation. Low
temperature PL studies reveal sharp Franck-Condon type emission bands and, in
the beta phase, two distinguishable vibronic sub-bands with energies of
approximately 199 and 158 meV at 25 K. This improved molecular level structural
order leads to a more complete analysis of the higher-order vibronic bands. A
net Huang-Rhys coupling parameter of just under 0.7 is typically observed but
the relative contributions by the two distinguishable vibronic sub-bands
exhibit an anomalous temperature dependence. The PL studies also identify
strongly correlated behavior between the relative beta phase 0-0 PL peak
position and peak width. This relationship is modeled under the assumption that
emission represents excitons in thermodynamic equilibrium from states at the
bottom of a quasi-one-dimensional exciton band. The crystalline phase, as
observed in annealed thin-film samples, has scattering peaks which are
incompatible with a simple hexagonal packing of the PF8 chains.

approximation, the spin-orbit interaction, and the on-site Coulomb interactions
amongst the Mo(4d) electrons, treated in the most general rotationally
invariant form. The Coulomb repulsion U plays a very important role in the
problem, and the semi-empirical value U$\sim$1.5-2.5 eV accounts simultaneously
for the metal-insulator (M-I) transition, the ferromagnetic (FM) - spin-glass
(SG) transition, and for the observed enhancement of the anomalous Hall effect
(AHE). The M-I transition is mainly controlled by $U$. The magnetic structure
at the metallic side is nearly collinear FM, due to the double exchange
mechanism. The transition into the insulating state is accompanied by the large
canting of spin and orbital magnetic moments. The sign of exchange interactions
in the insulating state is controlled by the Mo-Mo distances. Smaller distances
favor the antiferromagnetic coupling, which preludes the SG behavior in the
frustrated pyrochlore lattice. Large AHE is expected in the nearly collinear FM
state, near the point of M-I transition, and is related with the unquenched
orbital magnetization at the Mo sites. We also predict large magneto-optical
effect in the same FM compounds.

B",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.67.024426",,"cond-mat.str-el",,"  We develop an interpolating self-energy approach to the correlated
Kondo-lattice model. The correlation of the band electrons is taken into
account by a Hubbard interaction. The method is based on a self-energy ansatz,
the structure of which allows to fulfill a maximum number of exactly solvable
limiting cases. The parameters of the ansatz are fitted to spectral moments via
high-energy expansion of the self-energy. The band electron correlations are
taken into account by an effective medium approach being correct in the strong
coupling (U) regime. The theory is considered reliable for all temperatures,
band occupations, and exchange couplings. Results are presented for the
respective dependencies of spectral densities, quasiparticle densities of
states, and characteristic correlation functions, and interpreted in terms of
elementary spin exchange processes between itinerant conduction electrons and
localized magnetic moments. The appearance of magnetic polarons, the typical
quasiparticle of Kondo-lattices, in the energy spectrum is worked out. Spin
exchange processes prevent a total spin polarization of the band electrons even
for arbitrarily strong exchange couplings as long as the local moments are
represented by quantum mechanical spins.

We present here a phenomenological model which gives a good description of the

the causality of $M$, say: (a) if $-H(x,u)$ behaves subquadratically (i.e,
essentially $-H(x,u) \leq R_1(u) |x|^{2-\epsilon} $ for some $\epsilon >0$ and
large distance $|x|$ to a fixed point) and the spatial part $(M_0,
<\cdot,\cdot>_x) $ is complete, then the spacetime $M$ is globally hyperbolic,
(b) if $-H(x,u)$ grows at most quadratically (i.e, $-H(x,u) \leq R_1(u)
|x|^{2}$ for large $|x|$) then it is strongly causal and (c) $M$ is always
causal, but there are non-distinguishing examples (and thus, non-strongly
causal), even when $-H(x,u) \leq R_1(u) |x|^{2+\epsilon} $, for small $\epsilon
>0$.
  Therefore, the classical model $M_0 = \R^2$, $H(x,u) = \sum_{i,j} h_{ij}(u)
x_i x_j (\not\equiv 0)$, which is known to be strongly causal but not globally
hyperbolic, lies in the critical quadratic situation with complete $M_0$. This
must be taken into account for realistic applications. In fact, we argue that
$-H$ will be subquadratic (and the spacetime globally hyperbolic) if $M$ is
asymptotically flat. The relation of these results with the notion of

quasicircular orbits, are among the most promising sources for first-generation
ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Until now, the development of
data-analysis techniques to detect GWs from these sources has been focused
mostly on nonspinning BHs. The data-analysis problem for the spinning case is
complicated by the necessity to model the precession-induced modulations of the
GW signal, and by the large number of parameters needed to characterize the
system, including the initial directions of the spins, and the position and
orientation of the binary with respect to the GW detector. In this paper we
consider binaries of maximally spinning BHs, and we work in the
adiabatic-inspiral regime to build families of modulated detection templates
that (i) are functions of very few physical and phenomenological parameters,
(ii) model remarkably well the dynamical and precessional effects on the GW
signal, with fitting factors on average >~ 0.97, but (iii) might require
increasing the detection thresholds, offsetting at least partially the gains in
the fitting factors. Our detection-template families are quite promising also
for the case of neutron-star--black-hole binaries, with fitting factors on
average ~ 0.93. For these binaries we also suggest (but do not test) a further
template family, which would produce essentially exact waveforms written
directly in terms of the physical spin parameters.

work by Barvinsky, Das and Kunstatter, we are able to express the area spectrum
in terms of an integer-valued quantum number and an angular-momentum operator.
Moreover, by using an analogy between the Kerr black hole and a quantum
rotator, we are able to quantize the angular-momentum sector. We find the area
spectrum to be $A_{n,J_{cl}}=8\pi\hbar(n+J_{cl}+1/2)$, where $n$ and $J_{cl}$
are both integers. The quantum number $J_{cl}$ is related to but distinct from
the eigenvalue $j$ of the angular momentum of the black hole. Actually, it
represents the ``classical'' angular momentum and, for $J_{cl}\gg 1$,
$J_{cl}\approx j$.

incorporating an additional source due to their fluctuations. In stochastic
semiclassical gravity the main object of interest is the noise kernel, the
vacuum expectation value of the (operator-valued) stress-energy bi-tensor, and
the centerpiece is the (stochastic) Einstein-Langevin equation. We describe
this new theory via two approaches: the axiomatic and the functional. The
axiomatic approach is useful to see the structure of the theory from the
framework of semiclassical gravity. The functional approach uses the
Feynman-Vernon influence functional and the Schwinger-Keldysh close-time-path
effective action methods which are convenient for computations. It also brings
out the open systems concepts and the statistical and stochastic contents of
the theory such as dissipation, fluctuations, noise and decoherence. We then
describe the application of stochastic gravity to the backreaction problems in
cosmology and black hole physics. Intended as a first introduction to this

gravitational waves. Thus, if one is able to produce black holes at the Large
Hadron Collider, as much as 35% of the partons' energy should be emitted during
the so called balding phase. This energy will be missing, since we don't have
gravitational wave detectors able to measure such amplitudes. The collision at

the TESLA at DESY, through the processes of e^+e^-\to\mu^+\mu^-,H^+H^-,H^0H^0.

immediately into a characterization of the finite preprimal algebras: A finite

functions preserving a relation of one of the six types listed in the theorem.
The difficult part of the proof is to show that all maximal clones or preprimal

  water-filled nanotubes manifest quantum optical coherence interfering with
  the normal QBD?","10 pages, 4 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Recent discovery by Perutz et al. of the physical structure of the amyloid
that accumulates in neurons in certain neurodegenerative diseases like
Alzheimer's disease or Huntington's disease, suggests novel mechanism of
consciousness impairment, different from the neuronal loss, which is the end
stage of the pathogenic process. Amyloid is shown to be water-filled nanotubes
made of polymerized pathologically-changed proteins. It is hypothesized that
the water inside the new-formed nanotubes can manifest optical coherent
laser-like excitations and superradiance similarly to the processes taking part
in the normal brain microtubules as shown by Jibu et al. The interfering with
the macroscopic quantum effects within the normal microtubules can lead to
impairment of conscious experience. Experimental data in favor of quantum
theory of consciousness can be obtained from the research of the amyloid
nanotubes.

  equations); equation formatting made uniform",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  Quantum superpositions can be used for parallel information processing, but
only if protected against decoherence. A two-particle four-state system may
have two-dimensional subspaces that are partially or completely
decoherence-free, e.g., the symmetric triplet state as an example of the
former, the anti-symmetric singlet state of the latter. By extension, a
multiparticle system that in the laboratory basis is plagued by decoherence may
in some other basis exhibit the symmetries that yield such decoherence-free
subspaces (DFS's). Fully-interacting many-fermion spin 1/2 networks may be
mathematically transformed to a more tractable many-to-one (or -to-some)
variant. This paper applies such a transformation to a hypothetical network of
boson-like operators and then argues that a fully-interacting particle
number-preserving network of bosons plus fermions with supersymmetric degrees
of freedom may be more plausibly exploited so as to contain DFS's. Physical
systems that in some basis are inherently anti-symmetric are already known to
be useful for quantum information processing. Supersymmetric systems may be
likewise.

circuits. While it is known that in general a quantum algorithm based on
comparisons alone cannot outperform classical sorting algorithms by more than a
constant factor in time complexity, this is wrong in a space bounded setting.
We observe that for all storage bounds n/\log n\ge S\ge \log^3 n, one can
devise a quantum algorithm that sorts n numbers (using comparisons only) in
time T=O(n^{3/2}\log^{3/2} n/\sqrt S). We then show the following lower bound
on the time-space tradeoff for sorting $n$ numbers from a polynomial size range
in a general sorting algorithm (not necessarily based on comparisons):
TS=\Omega(n^{3/2}). Hence for small values of S the upper bound is almost
tight. Classically the time-space tradeoff for sorting is TS=\Theta(n^2).

framework of relativistic quantum theory to analyze a situation in which
measurements are performed by moving observers. We point out that under certain
conditions the perfect anti-correlation of an EPR pair of spins in the same
direction is deteriorated in the moving observers' frame due to the Wigner
rotation, and show that the degree of the violation of Bell's inequality prima
facie decreases with increasing the velocity of the observers if the directions
of the measurement are fixed. However, this does not imply a breakdown of
non-local correlation since the perfect anti-correlation is maintained in
appropriately chosen different directions. We must take account of this
relativistic effect in utilizing in moving frames the EPR correlation and the
violation of Bell's inequality for quantum communication.
