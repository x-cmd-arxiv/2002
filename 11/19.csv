show narrow, unresolved (by XMM) iron lines at 6.4 keV from cold matter that
must originate far from the inner accretion disc, perhaps in the putative torus
or outer broad line region. The strength of this narrow line appears to
decrease with luminosity, implying a reduction in the covering fraction of this
material in the more luminous quasars. Few examples of the broad, relativistic
iron line profile have been found by XMM-Newton, although in MCG -6-30-15, the
extreme breadth of the broad line component may imply a Kerr metric for the
central black hole. Generally, relativistic Fe K line profiles are not required
in a number of other Seyfert 1 X-ray spectra.

total mass and gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters from X-ray observations. We
model the aspherical shape of galaxy clusters by a triaxial model and compare
the true total mass and the true total gas mass fraction with the corresponding
quantities obtained with the assumption of spherical symmetry. In the triaxial
model we allow the extent along the line of sight to vary in order to describe
elongated and compressed cluster shapes. Using a sample of 10 ROSAT clusters
and a recent CHANDRA observation we find the following results. For prolate or
oblate shapes the difference between triaxial and spherical model both in the
mass and in the gas mass fraction are negligible (less than 3 %). For more
aspherical shapes the total mass is underestimated (overestimated) in the
centre, if the cluster is compressed (elongated). The gas mass fraction is
overestimated for compressed clusters and slightly underestimated for elongated
clusters. Comparing X-ray masses with gravitational lensing estimates, we find
that elongations along the line of sight can resolve discrepancies of masses
determined by the two different methods of up to ~30 %. The combination of
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and X-ray observations is useful to measure the elongation
of the cluster along the line of sight. As an application, we estimate the
elongation of the cluster CL0016+16 with two different approaches,
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements and comparison of weak lensing and X-ray
masses, and find reasonable agreement.

emission from H- and He-like ions of C through S, and from Fe L-shell ions, but
also include narrow radiative recombination continua, indicating that most of
the soft X-ray emission arises in low-temperature (kT few eV) photoionized
plasma. We confirm the conclusions of Kinkhabwala et al. (2002), based on
XMM-Newton RGS observations, that the entire nuclear spectrum can be explained
by recombination/radiative cascade following photoionization, and radiative
decay following photoexcitation, with no evidence for hot, collisionally
ionized plasma. In addition, this model also provides an excellent fit to the
spectrum of the Secondary region, albeit with radial column densities a factor
of three lower, as would be expected given its distance from the source of the
ionizing continuum. The remarkable overlap and kinematical agreement of the
optical and X-ray line emission, coupled with the need for a distribution of
ionization parameter to explain the X-ray spectra, collectively imply the
presence of a distribution of densities (over a few orders of magnitude) at
each radius in the ionization cone. Relative abundances of all elements are
consistent with Solar abundance, except for N, which is 2-3 times Solar. The
long wavelength spectrum beyond 30 A is rich of L-shell transitions of Mg, Si,
S, and Ar, and M-shell transitions of Fe. The velocity dispersion decreases
with increasing ionization parameter, as deduced from these long wavelength
lines and the Fe-L shell lines.

consistent with reprocessing of emission from a luminous, hidden X-ray source
by the obscuring molecular torus and X-ray narrow-line region (NLR). We detect
extended hard X-ray emission surrounding the X-ray peak in the nuclear region,
which may come from the outer portion of the torus. Detailed modeling of the
spectrum of the X-ray NLR confirms that it is excited by photoionization and
photoexcitation from the hidden X-ray source. K-shell emission lines from a
large range of ionization states of H-like and He-like N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S,
and Fe XVII-XXIV L-shell emission lines are modeled. The emission measure
distribution indicates roughly equal masses at all observed ionization levels
in the range log xi=1-3. We separately analyze the spectrum of an off-nuclear
cloud. We find that it has a lower column density than the nuclear region, and
is also photoionized. The nuclear X-ray NLR column density, optical depth,
outflow velocity, and electron temperature are all consistent with values
predicted by optical spectropolarimetry for the region which provides a
scattered view of the hidden Seyfert 1 nucleus.

gratings are significantly narrower than what would be expected from a star
with the known wind properties of tau Sco, although they are broader than the
corresponding lines seen in late-type coronal sources. While line ratios are
consistent with the hot plasma on this star being within a few stellar radii of

estimates confirm the peak in the age histogram attributed to the last tidal
encounter with M81; we find a peak formation epoch at slightly older ages than
previously published, log(t_peak / yr) = 9.04, with a Gaussian sigma of Delta
log(t_width) = 0.273. Cluster disruption has removed a large fraction of the
older clusters. Adopting the expression for the cluster disruption time-scale
of t_dis(M)= t_dis^4 (M/10^4 Msun)^gamma with gamma = 0.62 (Paper I), we find
that the ratios between the real cluster formation rates in the pre-burst phase
(log(t/yr) <= 9.4), the burst-phase (8.4 < log(t/yr) < 9.4) and the post-burst
phase (log(t/yr) <= 8.4) are about 1:2:1/40. The mass distribution of the
clusters formed during the burst shows a turnover at log(M_cl/Msun) ~ 5.3 which
is not caused by selection effects. This distribution can be explained by
cluster formation with an initial power-law mass function of slope alpha=2 up
to a maximum cluster mass of M_max = 3 x 10^6 Msun, and cluster disruption with
a normalisation time-scale t_dis^4 / t_burst = (3.0 +/- 0.3) x 10^{-2}. For a
burst age of 1 x 10^9 yr, we find that the disruption time-scale of a cluster
of 10^4 Msun is t_dis^4 ~ 3 x 10^7 years, with an uncertainty of approximately
a factor of two. This is the shortest disruption time-scale known in any
galaxy.

variability of the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG-6-30-15. The source clearly
shows the strong, linear correlation between rms variability amplitude and flux
first seen in Galactic X-ray binaries. The high frequency power spectral
density (PSD) of MCG-6-30-15 is examined in detail using a Monte Carlo fitting
procedure and is found to be well represented by a steep power-law at high
frequencies (with a power-law index alpha ~ 2.5), breaking to a flatter slope
(alpha ~ 1) below f_br ~ 0.6 - 2.0 x 10^-4 Hz, consistent with the previous
results of Uttley, McHardy & Papadakis. The slope of the power spectrum above
the break is energy dependent, with the higher energies showing a flatter PSD.
At low frequencies the variations between different energy bands are highly
coherent while at high frequencies the coherence is significantly reduced. Time
lags are detected between energy bands, with the soft variations leading the
hard. The magnitude of the lag is small (<200 s for the frequencies observed)
and is most likely frequency dependent. These properties are remarkably similar
to the temporal properties of the Galactic black hole candidate Cygnus X-1. The
characteristic timescales in these two types of source differ by ~10^5;
assuming that these timescales scale linearly with black hole mass then
suggests a black hole mass ~10^6 M_sun for MCG-6-30-15. We speculate that the
timing properties of MCG-6-30-15 may be analogous to those of Cyg X-1 in its
high/soft state and discuss a simple phenomenological model, originally
developed to explain the timing properties of Cyg X-1, that can explain many of
the observed properties of MCG-6-30-15.

in the time interval $(-t_a,0)$. In ACTRW formalism, the Green function $P({\bf

$t$. We derive a generalized Montroll--Weiss equation, which yields an exact
expression for the Fourier double Laplace transform of the ACTRW Green
function. Asymptotic long times $t_a$ and $t$ behaviors of the Green function
are investigated in detail. In the limit of $t\gg t_a$, we recover the standard
non-equilibrium CTRW behaviors, while the important regimes $t\ll t_a$ and $t

method for calculating the phonon propagator using the NRG technique is
presented, which turns out to be more accurate and reliable than the previous
works in that it calculates the phonon renormalization explicitly and satisfies
the boson sum rule better. The method is applied to calculate the renormalized
phonon propagators along with the electron propagators as the onsite Coulomb
repulsion $U$ and electron-phonon coupling constant $g$ are varied. As $g$ is
increased, the phonon mode is successively renormalized, and for $g \gtrsim
g_{co}$ crosses over to the regime where the mode splits into two components,
one of which approaches back to the bare frequency and the other develops into
a soft mode. The initial renormalization of the phonon mode, as $g$ is
increased from 0, depends on $U$ and the hybridization $\Delta$; it gets
softened (hardened) for $U \gtrsim (\lesssim) U_s (\Delta)$. Correlated with
the emergence of the soft mode is the central peak of the electron spectral
function severely suppressed. These NRG calculations will be compared with the
standard Green's function results for the weak coupling regime to understand
the phonon renormalization and soft mode.

spinon but also staggered flux of holon are considered. In this formalism, the
hopping order parameter of $physical$ electron is described by the product of
hopping order parameters of spinon and holon. The staggered flux amplitude of
electron is the difference of staggered flux amplitude of spinon and that of
holon. In $\pi$-flux phase of spinon, staggered fluxes of spinon and holon
cancel completely and staggered flux order of electron does not exist. However,
in staggered flux phase of spinon whose staggered flux amplitude is not $\pi$,
fluxes does not cancel completely and staggered flux amplitude of electron
remains. Thus, the phase transition between these two phases, $\pi$-flux phase
and staggered flux phase of spinon, becomes a second order transition in
$physical$ electron picture. The order parameter which characterizes this
transition is staggered flux order parameter of electron. A mean-field phase
diagram is shown. It is proved analytically that there is no coexisistence of
staggered flux and d-wave pairing. The temperature dependences of Fermi surface
and excitation gap at $(0,\pi)$ are shown. These behaviors are consistent with

a geometrical method which allows one to cover the corresponding physical

the method is applied in the field of gravitational wave (GW) data analysis,

ensembles with unitary and symplectic symmetry. The basic identities expressing
these facts can be extended to include a parameter, which in turn provides us
with probability density functions which we take as the definition of special

relating to superpositions interpolate between superimposed orthogonal

eigenvalue PDF for a single classical ensemble with unitary symmetry, while the

PDFs in terms of probabilities associated to the continuous
Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence between matrices, with entries chosen
from certain exponential distributions, and non-intersecting lattice paths, and
in the course of this probability measures on partitions and pairs of
partitions are identified. The latter are generalized by using Macdonald
polynomial theory, and a particular continuum limit -- the Jacobi limit -- of
the resulting measures is shown to give PDFs related to those appearing in the
work of Anderson on the Selberg integral. By interpreting Anderson's work as
giving the PDF for the zeros of a certain rational function, it is then
possible to identify random matrices whose eigenvalue PDFs realize the original
parameter dependent PDFs. This line of theory allows sampling of the original
parameter dependent PDFs, their Anderson-type generalizations and associated
marginal distributions, from the zeros of certain polynomials defined in terms

${\mathbb C}$ with a reduced reducible zero fiber $Y_0$ and other fibers $Y_t$
smooth, and given a reduced curve $C_0\subset Y_0$, the theorem provides a
sufficient condition for the existence of a one-parametric family of curves
$C_t\subset Y_t$, which induces an equisingular deformation for some singular
points of $C_0$ and certain prescribed deformations for the other
singularities. As application we give a comment on a recent theorem by G.
Mikhalkin on enumeration of nodal curves on toric surfaces via non-Archimedean

establish link between nodal curves over the field of complex Puiseux series

Near-angle two-particle correlations show directly that hadrons at pT > 4 GeV/c
result from the fragmentation of jets. Additional evidence for the onset of
perturbative QCD in this region comes from the flavor dependence of the
inclusive yields and elliptic flow. Finally, comparison of back-to-back hadron
pairs at high pT in p+p and in Au+Au collisions at various centralities reveals
a striking suppression of high pT back-to-back pairs in the most central Au+Au
collisions. All of these phenomena suggest a picture in which partons or their
hadronic fragments are strongly absorbed in the bulk matter, with the observed
hadrons resulting from jets produced on the periphery of the collision zone and
directed outwards.

entropy for the subsystem (a kicked top) is employed as a measure of

derived. The formula contains a correlation function that can be evaluated only

assumption that the correlation function decays exponentially which is
plausible for chaotic tops, it is shown that {\it the increment of the strength
of chaos does not enhance the production rate of entanglement} when the
coupling is weak enough and the subsystems (kicked tops) are strongly chaotic.
The result is confirmed by numerical experiments. The perturbative approach is
also applied to a weakly chaotic region, where tori and chaotic sea coexist in

as a model of an entangled state embedded in an environment. As a criterion for
entanglement we use a continuous-variable equivalent of the Peres-Horodecki
criterion, namely the Simon criterion. To quantify entanglement we use the
logarithmic negativity. We derive a condition, which assures that the state
remains entangled in spite of the interaction with the reservoir. Moreover for
the case of interaction with vacuum as an environment we show that a state of
interest after intinitely long interaction is not only entangled, but also
pure. For comparison we also consider a model in which each of both modes is
coupled to its own reservoir.

symmetries and generic properties are achieved in the autonomous framework of
deformation quantization. Transformation properties of diagonal Wigner
functions under space inversion, time reversal and parity transformations are
specified and their invariance under a four-parameter subgroup of symplectic
transformations are established. A generating function for all Wigner functions
is developed and this has been identified as the phase-space coherent state for
Landau levels. Integrated forms of generating function are used in generating
explicit expressions of marginal probability densities on all possible two
dimensional phase-space planes. Phase-space realization of unitary similarity
and gauge transformations as well as some general implications for the Wigner
function theory are presented.
