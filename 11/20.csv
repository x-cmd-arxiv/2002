observations by XMM-Newton. The EPIC spectrum shows diffuse X-ray emission from
the region corresponding to the radio shell. The X-ray spectrum of the whole
Pulsar Wind Nebula is well fitted by an absorbed power-law model with a photon
index Gamma ~ 1.9 and a 2-10 keV luminosity of about 6.5 X 10^34 d^2_10 erg
s^-1 (d_10 is the distance in units of 10 kpc). However, there is a clear
softening of the X-ray spectrum with distance from the core, which is most
probably related to the finite lifetime of the synchrotron emitting electrons.
This is fully consistent with the plerionic interpretation of the Pulsar Wind
Nebula, in which an embedded pulsar injects energetic electrons into its
surrounding region. At smaller scales, the eastern part of the arc-like
feature, which was first revealed by Chandra observations, shows indications of
a hard X-ray spectrum with a corresponding small photon index (Gamma=1.0 +-
0.7), while the western part presents a significantly softer spectrum
(Gamma=3.2 +- 0.7). A possible explanation for this feature is fast rotation
and subsequent Doppler boosting of electrons: the eastern part of the torus has
a velocity component pointing towards the observer, while the western part has
a velocity component in the opposite direction pointing away from the observer.

that both the emission and Faraday rotation occur nearby. We develop a
conceptual framework for interpretation of the observations. We can detect only
that polarized emission which has its origin closer than the polarization
horizon, at a distance d_ph; more distant polarized emission is undetectable
because of depth depolarization (differential Faraday rotation) and/or beam
depolarization (due to internal and external Faraday dispersion). d_ph depends
on the instrument used (frequency and beamwidth) as well as the direction being

structure of the halo to the core morphology. Our analysis shows that the halo
core (r<2-3 r_e) and the external halo (r>3 r_e) are characterised by different
dynamical properties and suggests a different origin of the two components. The
halo core has a complex morphology with a main X-ray emission peak, coincident
with the center of the optical galaxy, and several secondary peaks. The spatial
and spectral analysis of the central peak shows that this feature is produced
by denser hot gas in the galaxy core. Our data support the scenario where the
gas is kinetically heated by stellar mass losses. Comparison with previously
published studies suggest that the core of X-ray extended galaxies is
associated to the stellar distribution and has similar properties to the X-ray
halo of compact galaxies. The secondary peaks are due instead to interactions
between the radio-emitting plasma and the surrounding ISM. We found that the
energy input by the central radio source in the ISM may be large enough to
prevent gas from cooling. The total mass profile shows the presence of a dark
matter halo extending on cluster scales which is likely to be associated with
the whole cluster rather than with NGC 507. This structure is typical of many
X-ray bright Early-Type galaxies and may explain the spatial and spectral
differences with X-ray compact galaxies largely debated in literature. Finally
we discuss the nature of the point sources detected in the HRI FOV.

non-thermally, but is consistent with the original scenario of thermal emission
from warm gas at ~ 10^6 K. The mass of the warm gas is on par with that of the
hot X-ray emitting plasma, and significantly more massive if the warm gas

with b < 25 km/s because of the high spectral resolution R=45000, while other
lines show broad profiles (b > 65 km/s). We use three properties of C IV lines,
specifically, time variability, covering factor, and absorption line profile,
to classify them into quasar intrinsic absorption lines (QIALs) and spatially
intervening absorption lines (SIALs). The C IV lines at 2.42 < z_abs < 2.45 are
classified as QIALs in spite of their large velocity shifts from the quasar.
Perhaps they are produced by gas clouds ejected from the quasar with the
velocity of v_ej = 8000 km/s -- 10000 km/s. On the other hand, three C IV lines
at 2.48 < z_abs < 2.55 are classified as SIALs, which suggests there exist
intervening absorbers near the quasar. We, however, cannot rule out QIALs for
the two lines at z_abs ~ 2.54 and 2.55, because their velocity shifts, 430 km/s
blueward and 950 km/s redward of the quasar, are very small. The C IV line at

low-ionization metal lines (Al II, Si II, and Fe II). The velocity distribution

typically among the lowest luminosities of the gas rich dwarf galaxies.

consistent with normal dI galaxies which currently exhibit temporarily

density (eta) from 10^-5 to 10^-2 is explored, for Mach numbers (M) between 2.6

simulation time. The bow shocks are found to be spherical at source sizes below
a critical value r1 (blastwave phase), which can reach up to 10 jet radii.
[...] The numerical work is complemented by an analytic approach for the
spherical phase. Extending previous work, the radial force balance could be
integrated for arbitrary background density and energy input, which results in
a global solution. The analytic results are shown to be consistent with the
numerical work, and a lower limit to r1 can be calculated, which falls below
the numerical results by a few jet radii. It is shown explicitely how a King
density distribution changes the discussed aspects of the bow shock
propagation. Because the jet head propagates very fast in the blastwave phase,
it turns out that it is not possible to ``frustrate'' a jet by a high density
environment. This is very important for the class of small radio galaxies
(compact symmetric objects / GHz peaked sources): They have to be young. During
its blastwave phase, a powerful jet can transfer typically 10^60 erg to the

discussed: an equatorial wind model produced by wind bi-stability, and a
Keplerian viscous disc model. Both models are successful in providing a site
for dust formation once they have cooled sufficiently. However, the
optical--infra-red continuum is calculated and it is found that both models
have significant trouble in accounting for observations. In particular the
optical--near-IR emission is accounted for, but the dust emission is
underestimated by at least an order of magnitude. Variations in the structure
of the models (the temperature variation with radius, the density structure and
the dust opacity) are investigated to assess how (in)appropriate the standard
models are for supergiant B[e] star discs. Changing the temperature structure,
and making simple dust opacity changes within the disc has little effect on the
resultant continuum emission. By altering the density structure of the discs,
the continuum may be accounted for by both models: the equatorial wind model
requires a very flat density profile which is impossible to explain with any
accelerating wind, and the viscous disc model's density structure is required
to fall off less steeply with radius than would have been expected, although
this may be explained from consideration of viscous processes in the disc. It
is recognised that both theoretical interpretations have difficulties and
unsolved problems.

monitored the IDV in this source with the Australia Telescope Compact Array

annual cycle in the characteristic time-scale of variability. This annual cycle
demonstrates unequivocally that interstellar scintillation is the cause of the
rapid IDV at radio wavelengths observed in this source. We use the observed
annual cycle to constrain the velocity of the scattering material, and the
angular size of the scintillating component of PKS 1257-326. We observe a time
delay, which also shows an annual cycle, between the similar variability
patterns at the two frequencies. We suggest that this is caused by a small (~10
microarcsecond) offset between the centroids of the 4.8 and 8.6 GHz components,
and may be due to opacity effects in the source. The statistical properties of
the observed scintillation thus enable us to resolve source structure on a
scale of ~10 microarcseconds, resolution orders of magnitude higher than
current VLBI techniques allow. General implications of scintillation for the

application of the two primary processes is assumed to be independently drawn

the two primary processes are linear and extend the conclusions to non-linear
processes as well. The growth scaling exponent of the average roughness with
the number of applications is found to be determined by the long time tail of
the distribution functions. For processes in which both mean application times
are finite, the scaling behavior follows that of the corresponding cyclical
process in which the uniform application time of each primary process is given
by its mean. If the distribution functions decay with a small enough power law
for the mean application times to diverge, the growth exponent is found to
depend continuously on this power law exponent. In contrast, the roughness
exponent does not depend on the timing of the applications. The analytical
results are supported by numerical simulations of various pairs of primary
processes and with different distribution functions. Self-affine surfaces grown

randomly changing weather conditions) and in man-made devices such as

sharp decrease at about 5.5K, at which temperature antiferromagnetic ordering
of the Eu spins simultaneously appears, indicating coupling between the
magnetism and dielectric properties. This may be attributed to the modification
of the soft-phonon mode, $T_{1\mu}$, which is the main contribution to the
large dielectric constant, by the Eu spins(7$\mu_B$ per Eu). By adding the
coupling term between the magnetic and electrical subsystems as $
-g\sum\limits_l {\sum\limits_{< {i,j}} {q_l^2}} \overrightarrow {S_i} \cdot

show that Presburger arithmetic is closed under unary counting quantifiers.
Precisely, this means that for every first-order formula phi(y,z_1,...,z_k)
over the signature {<,+} there is a first-order formula psi(x,z_1,...,z_k)
which expresses over the structure <Nat,<,+> (respectively, over initial
segments of this structure) that the variable x is interpreted exactly by the
number of possible interpretations of the variable y for which the formula
phi(y,z_1,...,z_k) is satisfied. Applying this theorem, we obtain an easy proof
of Ruhl's result that reachability (and similarly, connectivity) in finite

show the failure of a particular version of the Crane Beach conjecture.

of dense quark matter, with particular reference to diquark condensates and
color superconductivity. In the present work we report calculations made for
the excitations of quark matter for relatively low densities of the deconfined
phase and in the absence of meson or diquark condensation. Here, we are
interested in elucidating the role of ""Pauli blocking"", as such blocking
affects the calculation vector, scalar and pseudoscalar $q\bar q$ excitations.
As a byproduct of our analysis, we extend our calculations to higher densities
and explore some consequences of the use of density-dependent coupling
parameters for the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. (Such density-dependent
parameters have been used in some of our previous work.) For our analysis made
at large values of the matter density, we assume that at about 13 times nuclear
matter density quark matter has only minimal nonperturbative interactions. At
that high density we compare the result for hadronic current correlation
functions calculated with density-dependent and density-independent NJL
coupling constants. We find evidence for the use of density-dependent
parameters, since the results with the density-independent constants do not go
over to the perturbative description which we assume to be correct for
$\rho\simeq 6\rho_c$, where $\rho_c$ is the matter density for the
finite-density confinement-deconfinement transition. The use of
density-dependent coupling constants in the study of diquark condensates and
color superconductivity has not been explored as yet, and is a topic requiring
further investigation, particularly given the strong interest in the properties
of dense quark matter and color superconductivity.

these algebras, the overall structure of the prime spectrum is governed by a
partition into strata determined by the action of a suitable group of
automorphisms of the algebra. We discuss this stratification in detail, as well
as its use in determining the primitive spectrum -- under suitable conditions,
the primitive ideals are precisely those prime ideals which are maximal within
their strata. The discussion then turns to the global structure of the
primitive spectra of quantized coordinate rings, and to the conjecture that
these spectra are topological quotients of the corresponding classical affine
varieties. We describe the solution to the conjecture for quantized coordinate
rings of full affine spaces and (somewhat more generally) affine toric
varieties. The final part of the paper is devoted to the quantized coordinate
ring of $n\times n$ matrices. We mention parallels between this algebra and the
classical coordinate ring, such as the primeness of quantum analogs of
determinantal ideals. Finally, we describe recent work which determined, for
the $3\times3$ case, all prime ideals invariant under the group of winding
automorphisms governing the stratification mentioned above.

the reduced group C*-algebra. Following A. Connes, the Dirac operator of the
triple then can induce a metric on the state space of reduced group C*-algebra.
Recent studies by M. Rieffel raise several questions with respect to such a
metric on the state space. Here it is proven that for a free non Abelian group,
the metric on the state space is bounded. Further we propose a relaxation in
the way a length function is used in the construction of a metric, and we show
that for groups of rapid decay there are many metrics related to a length
function which all have all the expected properties. The boundedness result for
free groups is based on an estimate of the completely bounded norm of a certain
Schur multiplier and on some techniques concerning free groups due to U.

Gibbs states in classical continuous systems on ${\mathbb R}^d, d \ge 1$. The
aim is to derive macroscopic quantities from a given micro- or mesoscopic
system. The scaling we consider has been investigated in \cite{Br80},
\cite{Ro81}, \cite{Sp86}, and \cite{GP86}, under the assumption that the
underlying potential is in $C^3_0$ and positive. We prove that the Dirichlet
forms of the scaled stochastic dynamics converge on a core of functions to the
Dirichlet form of a generalized Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process. The proof is based
on the analysis and geometry on the configuration space which was developed in
\cite{AKR98a}, \cite{AKR98b}, and works for general Gibbs measures of Ruelle
type. Hence, the underlying potential may have a singularity at the origin,
only has to be bounded from below, and may not be compactly supported.
Therefore, singular interactions of physical interest are covered, as e.g. the
one given by the Lennard--Jones potential, which is studied in the theory of
fluids. Furthermore, using the Lyons--Zheng decomposition we give a simple
proof for the tightness of the scaled processes. We also prove that the
corresponding generators, however, do not converge in the $L^2$-sense. This
settles a conjecture formulated in \cite{Br80}, \cite{Ro81}, \cite{Sp86}.

finitely many values: 0 and d_1, ..., d_k, where d_i:=deg P_i. We then describe

the equilibrium measure \mu associated to f as a generalized intersection of
positive currents. We then gives an estimate of the Hausdorff dimension of \mu.

rate of inconclusive results that maximizes the probability of correct
detection, when distinguishing between a collection of mixed quantum states. We
develop a sufficient condition for the scaled inverse measurement to maximize
the probability of correct detection for the case in which the rate of
inconclusive results exceeds a certain threshold. Using this condition we
derive the optimal measurement for linearly independent pure-state sets, and
for mixed-state sets with a broad class of symmetries. Specifically, we
consider geometrically uniform (GU) state sets and compound geometrically
uniform (CGU) state sets with generators that satisfy a certain constraint.
  We then show that the optimal measurements corresponding to GU and CGU state
sets with arbitrary generators are also GU and CGU respectively, with
generators that can be computed very efficiently in polynomial time within any
desired accuracy by solving a semidefinite programming problem.

an operator P having the following properties: (i) P is linear and Hermitian;
(ii) P commutes with H; (iii) P^2=1; (iv) the nth eigenstate of H is also an
eigenstate of P with eigenvalue (-1)^n. Given these properties, it is
appropriate to refer to P as the parity operator and to say that H has parity
symmetry, even though P may not refer to spatial reflection. Thus, if the
Hamiltonian has the form H=p^2+V(x), where V(x) is real (so that H possesses
time-reversal symmetry), then it immediately follows that H has PT symmetry.
This shows that PT symmetry is a generalization of Hermiticity: All Hermitian
Hamiltonians of the form H=p^2+V(x) have PT symmetry, but not all PT-symmetric
Hamiltonians of this form are Hermitian.

  Sampling","16 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Many quantum algorithms, including Shor's celebrated factoring and discrete
log algorithms, proceed by reduction to a hidden subgroup problem, in which a
subgroup H of a group G must be determined from a quantum state y uniformly
supported on a left coset of H. These hidden subgroup problems are then solved
by Fourier sampling: the quantum Fourier transform of y is computed and
measured. When the underlying group is non-Abelian, two important variants of
the Fourier sampling paradigm have been identified: the weak standard method,
where only representation names are measured, and the strong standard method,
where full measurement occurs. It has remained open whether the strong standard
method is indeed stronger, that is, whether there are hidden subgroups that can
be reconstructed via the strong method but not by the weak, or any other known,
method. In this article, we settle this question in the affirmative. We show
that hidden subgroups of semidirect products of Z_p by Z_q, where q divides
(p-1) and q = p / polylog(p), can be efficiently determined by the strong
standard method. Furthermore, the weak standard method and the ``forgetful''
Abelian method are insufficient for these groups. We extend this to an
information-theoretic solution for the hidden subgroup problem over semidirect
products of Z_p by \Z_q where q divides (p-1) and, in particular, the Affine
groups A_p. Finally, we prove a closure property for the class of groups over
which the hidden subgroup problem can be solved efficiently.

Realistic detection schemes such as {\sc on/off} photodetection, homodyne

and finite resolution, are taken into account. We show that conditional {\sc
