profiles of low-mass objects and the faint-end slopes of the Schechter
luminosity function and the Press-Schechter mass function. By requiring the
luminosity and mass functions to give consistent predictions for the
distribution of image separation below 1'', we show that dark matter halos with
masses below 10^12 M_sun cannot have a single type of profile, be it the
singular isothermal sphere (SIS) or the shallower ``universal'' dark matter
profile. Instead, consistent results are achieved if we allow a fraction of the
halos at a given mass to be luminous with the SIS profile, and the rest be dark
with an inner logarithmic slope shallower than -1.5 to compensate for the
steeper faint-end slope of the mass function compared with the luminosity
function. We quantify how rapidly the SIS fraction must decrease with
decreasing halo mass, thereby providing a statistical measure for the
effectiveness of feedback processes on the baryon content in low-mass halos.

of the order of 1 au. Using a simple time dependent model for the evolution of
gas and solids in the disk, I show that replenishment of solid material in the
inner disk, following the inward passage of a giant planet, is generally
inefficient. Unless the timescale for diffusion of dust is much shorter than
the viscous timescale, or planetesimal formation is surprisingly slow, the
surface density of planetesimals at 1 au will typically be depleted by one to

theory.All models attain a turbulent state with volume averaged stress
parameter alpha ~ 0.005. At any particular time the vertically and azimuthally
averaged value exhibited large fluctuations in radius. Time averaging over
periods exceeding 3 orbital periods at the outer boundary of the disc resulted
in a smoother quantity with radial variations within a factor of two or so. The
vertically and azimuthally averaged radial velocity showed much larger spatial
and temporal fluctuations, requiring additional time averaging for 7-8 orbital
periods at the outer boundary to limit them. Comparison with the value derived
from the averaged stress using viscous disc theory yielded schematic agreement
for feasible averaging times but with some indication that the effects of
residual fluctuations remained. The behaviour described above must be borne in
mind when considering laminar disc simulations with anomalous Navier--Stokes
viscosity. This is because the operation of a viscosity as in classical viscous
disc theory with anomalous viscosity coefficient cannot apply to a turbulent
disc undergoing rapid changes due to external perturbation. The classical
theory can only be used to describe the time averaged behaviour of the parts of
the disc that are in a statistically steady condition for long enough for

structures traced by the old stellar populations. We make NUV--(NUV-I) pixel
color-magnitude diagrams (pCMDs) that reveal plumes of pixels with strongly
varying NUV surface brightness and nearly constant I surface brightness. The
plumes correspond to sharply bounded radial ranges, with (NUV-I) at a given NUV
surface brightness being bluer at larger radii. The plumes are parallel to the
reddening vector and simple model mixtures of young and old populations, thus
neither reddening nor the fraction of the young population can produce the
observed separation between the plumes. The images, radial surface-brightness,
and color plots indicate that the separate plumes are caused by sharp declines
in the surface densities of the old populations at radii corresponding to disk
resonances. The maximum surface brightness of the NUV light remains nearly
constant with radius, while the maximum I surface brightness declines sharply
with radius. An MUV image of NGC 6782 shows emission from the nuclear ring. The
distribution of points in an (MUV-NUV) vs. (NUV-I) pixel color-color diagram is
broadly consistent with the simple mixture model, but shows a residual trend
that the bluest pixels in (MUV-NUV) are the reddest pixels in (NUV-I). This may
be due to a combination of red continuum from late-type supergiants and [SIII]
emission lines associated with HII regions in active star-forming regions. We
have shown that pixel mapping is a powerful tool for studying the distribution
and strength of on-going star formation in galaxies. Deep, multi-color imaging
can extend this to studies of extinction, and the ages and metallicities of
composite stellar populations in nearby galaxies.

with a protoplanet of 5 Jupiter masses. The disc model had H/r=0.1,and a value
of the Shakura & Sunyaev alpha ~ 0.005. The protoplanet opened a gap in the
disc, with the interaction leading to inward migration on the expected time
scale. Spiral waves were launched by the protoplanet and although they were
diffused and dissipated through interaction with the turbulence, they produced
an outward angular momentum flow which compensated for a reduced flux
associated with the turbulence, so maintaining the gap. When compared with
laminar disc models with the same estimated alpha, the gap was found to be
deeper and wider indicating that the turbulent disc behaved as if it possessed
a smaller alpha. This may arise for two reasons. First, the turbulence does not
provide a source of constantly acting friction in the near vicinity of the
planet that leads to steady mass flow into the gap region. Instead the
turbulence is characterised by large fluctuations in the radial velocity, and
time averaging over significant time scales is required to recover the
underlying mass flow through the disc. Near the planet the disc material
experiences high amplitude perturbations on time scales that are short relative
to the time scale required for averaging. The disc response is thus likely to
be altered relative to a Navier--Stokes model. Second, the simulation indicates
that an ordered magnetic connection between the inner and outer disc can occur
enabling angular momentum to flow out across the gap, helping to maintain it
independently of the protoplanet's tide. This type of effect may assist gap
formation for smaller mass protoplanets which otherwise would not be able to
maintain them.

  Markov Chain Monte Carlo","27 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Quantitative Finance",,,,"cond-mat",,"  We propose a novel portfolio selection approach that manages to ease some of
the problems that characterise standard expected utility maximisation. The
optimal portfolio is no longer defined as the extremum of a suitably chosen
utility function: the latter, instead, is reinterpreted as the logarithm of a
probability distribution for optimal portfolios and the selected portfolio is
defined as the expected value with respect to this distribution. A further
theoretical aspect is the adoption of a Bayesian inference framework. We find
that this approach has several attractive features, when comparing it to the
standard maximisation of expected utility.We remove the over-pronounced
sensitivity on external parameters that plague optimisation procedures and
obtain a natural and self consistent way to account for uncertainty in
knowledge and for personal views. We test the proposed method against
traditional expected utility maximisation, using artificial data to simulate
finite-sample behaviour, and find superior performance of our procedure. All
numerical integrals are carried out by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, where
the chains are generated by an adapted version of Hybrid Monte Carlo. We
present numerical results for a portfolio of eight assets using historical time
series running from January 1988 to January 2002.

it is generic within the class of non-tilted SH cosmologies, being of the same

is its role in connecting the outcome of Monte Carlo simulations to continuum

role of chiral symmetry on the lattice and to the mixing of lattice operators
under renormalization. The construction of chiral gauge theories regularized on

chiral symmetry, is also discussed. Finally, a few detailed examples of lattice

analog of the Cabibbo angle $\lambda$ in the Wolfenstein representation, and
two parameters, $\rho$ and $\kappa$, each of order one. The expansion

singularities for all Q^2>0 is considered for the initial perturbation theory
approximations up to four loop order. The finiteness of the analytic coupling
at zero is shown to be a consequence of the asymptotic freedom property of the
initial theory. The nonperturbative contributions to the analytic coupling are
extracted explicitly. For all Q>Lambda they are represented in the form of an
expansion in inverse powers of Euclidean momentum squared. The effective method
for a precise calculation of the analytic running coupling is developed on the
basis of the stated expansion. The energy scale evolution of the analytic
running coupling for the one- to four-loop cases is studied and the higher loop
stability and low dependence on the quark threshold matching conditions in
comparison with the perturbative running coupling were found. Normalizing the
analytic running coupling at the scale of the rest mass of the Z boson with the
world average value of the strong coupling constant,
alpha_{an}(M_Z^2)=0.1181^{+0.002}_{-0.002}, one obtains as a result of the
energy scale evolution of the analytic running coupling alpha_{an}(M_tau^2)=
0.2943^{+0.0111}_{-0.0106} that is notably lower than the estimations of the
coupling strength available at the scale of the mass of the tau lepton.

effective mass, under certain conditions. In the literature, two different
definitions for the effective mass have been suggested. We show that for
quasi-degenerate mass schemes (with an overall mass scale $m$ and splitting
$\Delta m^2$) the two definitions coincide up to $(\Delta m^2)^2/m^4$

integral energy spectrum. We show that the spectrum with a single mass can be
used also to fit the data in the case of $4\nu$-schemes motivated, in

induce flavour violating scattering reactions between solar matter and
neutrinos. The model does not contain any vacuum mass or mixing angle for the
first generation neutrino. Instead, the effective mixing in the first
generation is induced via the new interactions. The model provides a natural
interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly, and is consistent with
reactor experiments. We determine all R-parity violating couplings which can
contribute to the effective neutrino oscillations, and summarize the present
laboratory bounds. Independent of the specific nature of the (supersymmetric)
flavour violating model, the experimental data on the solar neutrino rates and
the recoil electron energy spectrum are inconsistent with the theoretical
predictions. The confidence level of the $\chi^2$-analysis ranges between $\sim
10^{-4}$ and $\sim 10^{-3}$. The incompatibility, is due to the new SNO
results, and excludes the present model. We conclude that a non-vanishing

model. We expect this also to apply to the solutions based on other flavour

choosing the form of the metric, to restore corresponding Lagrangian. It is
demonstrated that exactly solvable models, found earlier, can be extended to
include an electric charge only in two cases: either the dilaton-gravitation
coupling is proportional to the potential term, or the latter vanishes. The
second case leads to the effective potential with a negative amplitude and we
analyze, how this fact affects the structure of spacetime. We also discuss the

can also present sustained oscillations of its width. There are very important
phenomena (like the soliton-antisoliton collisions) where the existence of

the requirement of the existence of a differential operator $D_n$ of order $n$
mapping its eigenfunctions to adjoint eigenfunctions. For first order operators
these reductions (and multi-component analogs thereof) lead to the Lame
equations descriptive of orthogonal coordinate systems. Our main observation is
that $n$-th order reductions coincide with the projective-geometric
`Gauss-Codazzi' equations governing special classes of line congruences in the
projective space $P^{2n-1}$, which is the projectivised kernel of $D_n$. In the
second order case this leads to the theory of $W$-congruences in $P^3$ which
belong to a linear complex, while the third order case corresponds to isotropic
congruences in $P^5$. Higher reductions are compatible with odd-order flows of
the Davey-Stewartson hierarchy. All these flows preserve the kernel $D_n$, thus
defining nontrivial geometric evolutions of line congruences. Multi-component
generalizations are also discussed. The correspondence between geometric
picture and the theory of integrable systems is established; the definition of
the class of reductions and all geometric objects in terms of the
multicomponent KP hierarchy is presented. Generating forms for reductions of
arbitrary order are constructed.
