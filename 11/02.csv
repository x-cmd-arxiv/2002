nearby molecular clouds extends over a period of at least 10 Myr, implying
quasi-static cloud evolution and star formation. Their conclusions contradict
other recent results indicating that molecular clouds are transient objects and
star formation proceeds rapidly. The Palla & Stahler picture implies that most
molecular clouds should have extremely low rates of star formation, and that in
such inactive stages the stellar initial mass function should be strongly
skewed toward producing stars with masses $\gtrsim 1 \msun$; neither prediction
is supported by observations. I show that the Palla & Stahler conclusions for
Taurus depend almost entirely on a small number of stars with masses $\gtrsim 1
\msun$; the lower-mass stars show no evidence for such an extended period of
star formation. I further show that most of the stars apparently older than 10
Myr in the direction of Taurus are probably foreground non-members. I also
present birthline calculations which support the idea that the ages of the
stars with masses $\gtrsim 1 \msun$ have been systematically overestimated
because ``birthline'' age corrections have been underestimated; such birthlines
would eliminate the need to postulate skewed initial mass functions. The
simplest and most robust explanation of current observations characterizing the
vast majority of young stars in molecular clouds is that cloud and star
formation is rapid and dynamic.

X-ray bright shells surrounding the radio source are the coolest and least
abundant regions in the cluster. The mass-deposition rate in the cooling flow
is 26 < Mdot < 42 Msun/yr. This rate is ~ a factor of three lower than the
rates found with previous X-ray observatories. Based on a stellar population
analysis using imaging and spectra at wavelengths spanning the far UV to the
NIR, we find a star formation rate of 0.6 Msun/yr within a 3 arcsec radius of
the nucleus of the central cluster galaxy. Total and gas mass profiles for the

Robust evidence is found for the existence of a high-velocity shock at the
inner edges of the nebulae. Such a shock is predicted in hydrodynamical models
but had not previously been observed. The shock gas is accelerated by the fast
wind from the central star. A similar shock at the outer edges traces the
expansion of the ionized shell into the ambient AGB wind. Evidence for
localized regions of high velocity is also found from lines of intermediate
excitation, for two of nebulae. We explore several possible interpretations:
(1) an embedded shock at intermediate radii, as predicted by hydrodynamic
models at the position of the outer edge of the swept-up inner shell; (2)
deviations form spherical symmetry, where in some directions the
intermediate-excitation lines extend into the region of the outer shock; (3) An
intermediate swept-up shell, as seen in some Galactic planetary nebulae. The
remaining nebula, with a [WC] star, shows strong turbulence. This may trace a
superposition of many embedded shock-lets. We suggest a relation to the

one to evaluate the form of the van der Waals (dispersion) interactions between

these interactions in two extreme opposite regimes of separation: fully
retarded and nonretarded. In the fully retarded regime (very large separation),
the magnitude of the interaction is determined by just the static
polarizability of the cluster(s). In the nonretarded regime (small separation),
we employ a single resonant frequency model of thecluster polarizability to
derive expressions for the interactions' coefficients. Numerical examples are
presented to demonstrate that many-body screening of these interactions can be
significant. The results represent the corrections to the commonly used
approximation of pairwise additivity of interatomic interactions.

granular systems under a variety of conditions. Using photoelastic particles to
determine forces at the grain scale, we experimentally show that disorder,
packing structure, friction and texture significantly affect the average force
response in granular systems. For packings with weak disorder, the mean forces
propagate primarily along lattice directions. The width of the response along
these preferred directions grows with depth, increasingly so as the disorder of
the system grows. Also, as the disorder increases, the two propagation
directions of the mean force merge into a single direction. The response
function for the mean force in the most strongly disordered system is
quantitatively consistent with an elastic description for forces applied nearly
normally to a surface. These observations are consistent with recent
predictions of Bouchaud et al. and with the anisotropic elasticity models of
Goldenberg and Goldhirsch. At this time, it is not possible to distinguish
between these two models. The data do not support a diffusive picture, as in
the q-model. This system with shear deformation is characterized by stress
chains that are strongly oriented along an angle of 45 degrees, corresponding
to the compressive direction of the shear deformation. In this case, the
spatial correlation function for force has a range of only one particle size in
the direction transverse to the chains, and varies as a power law in the
direction of the chains, with an exponent of -0.81. The response to forces is
strongest along the direction of the force chains, as expected. Forces applied
in other directions are effectively refocused towards the strong force chain
direction.

occur in the matching of full-theory amplitudes onto effective-theory operators
containing soft light quarks, such as the appearance of an intermediate mass

Important examples of effective-theory operators with soft light quarks are

generalized to the case when the $X_i$ are general integer-valued random

made use of simplifying assumptions: a uniform density profile and a Maxwellian
EEDF. In the present study a self-consistent system of equations for the
kinetic description of nonlocal, nonuniform, nearly collisionless plasmas of
low-pressure discharges is derived. It consists of the nonlocal conductivity
operator and the averaged kinetic equation for calculation of the nonMaxwellian
EEDF. The importance of accounting for the nonuniform plasma density profile on
both the current density profile and the EEDF is demonstrated.

A 67, 014301 (2003).","10.1103/PhysRevA.67.014301",,"quant-ph",,"  In this paper we discuss the problem of splitting the total correlations for
a bipartite quantum state described by the Von Neumann mutual information into
classical and quantum parts. We propose a measure of the classical correlations
as the difference between the Von Neumann mutual information and the relative
entropy of entanglement. We compare this measure with different measures
proposed in the literature.

master equations for 2-level systems and show that none of the inverse
relaxation times can be greater than the sum of the others. The relation is
experimentally proved or disproved and can be considered to be a measure for or
against the applicability of the Lindblad-type master equations and therefore
of the so-called completely positive condition.

by replacing the conventional Hermiticity condition on the Hamiltonian by a
weaker requirement through the introduction of the notion of
pseudo-Hermiticity. In the present study we investigate eigenvalues,

property of pseudo-Hermiticity.

reducible representation of canonical commutation relations. Standard
properties of such states are recovered as certain limiting cases. The new
formalism leads to field operators and not operator-valued distributions. The
example of radiation fields produced by a classical current shows an automatic
regularization of the infrared divergence.
