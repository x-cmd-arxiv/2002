emission is detected from 7 of the 10 bright submm sources in this region,
corresponding to an X-ray detected submm source density of ~360 deg^-2 (>~36%
of the bright submm source population). Two of the X-ray detected sources have
nearby (within 3"") X-ray companions, suggesting merging/interacting sources or
gravitational lensing effects, and 3 lie within the approximate extent of a
proto-cluster candidate. Five of the X-ray detected sources have flat X-ray
spectral slopes, suggesting obscured AGN activity. X-ray spectral analyses
suggest that one of these AGNs may be a Compton-thick source; of the other 4
AGNs, 3 appear to be Compton-thin sources and one has poor constraints. The
rest-frame unabsorbed X-ray luminosities of these AGNs are more consistent with
those of Seyfert galaxies than QSOs. Thus, the low X-ray detection rate of
bright submm sources by moderately deep X-ray surveys appears to be due to the
relatively low luminosities of the AGNs rather than Compton-thick absorption. A
comparison of these sources to the well-studied heavily obscured AGN NGC6240
shows that the average AGN contribution is negligible at submm wavelengths. The
X-ray properties of the other 2 X-ray detected sources are consistent with
those expected from luminous star formation; however, we cannot rule out the
possibility that low-luminosity AGNs are present. The 3 X-ray undetected
sources appear to lie at high redshift (z>4) and could be either AGNs or
starbust galaxies.

the secondary periods must correspond to nonradial modes of oscillation. Their
beating with the primary (radial) pulsation leads to a long-term amplitude and
phase modulation, known as the Blazhko effect. The Blazhko RRab variables occur
more frequently in the Galactic Bulge than in the LMC. The opposite tendency is
seen in case of the RRd stars. The differences of incidence rates are most
likely caused by different metallicity of the two populations. We discuss
pulsation properties of the OGLE-1 Blazhko stars and compare them with

extremely red objects (EROs) in two of these fields and discuss the possibility
that they are associated with the DLA galaxies. These observations add to the
small but growing list of DLA galaxies at low redshift. At the present time, 14
DLA galaxies in the redshift range 0.05 < z <1 have been studied. The
distributions of DLA galaxy properties for these 14 cases are discussed and
some important trends emerge. Low-luminosity dwarf galaxies with small impact
parameters dominate this small sample. Also, four of the five highest column
density systems, which dominate in the determination of the cosmological
neutral gas mass density, arise in low surface brightness dwarf galaxies. Zwaan
et al. have shown that only 15% of the neutral gas at the present epoch is

temperature information of the Parkes single dish telescope. In particular, we
focus on the abundance and temperature of the cool atomic clouds in the inner
galaxy. The resulting mean opacity of the HI, <kappa>, is measured as a
function of Galactic radius; it increases going in from the solar circle, to a
peak in the molecular ring of about four times its local value. This suggests
that the cool phase is more abundant there, and colder, than it is locally.
  The distribution of cool phase temperatures is derived in three different
ways. The naive, ``spin temperature'' technique overestimates the cloud
temperatures, as expected. Using two alternative approaches we get good
agreement on a histogram of the cloud temperatures, T(cool), corrected for
blending with warm phase gas. The median temperature is about 65 K, but there
is a long tail reaching down to temperatures below 20 K. Clouds with
temperatures below 40 K are common, though not as common as warmer clouds (40
to 100 K).
  Using these results we discuss two related quantities, the peak brightness
temperature seen in emission surveys, and the incidence of clouds seen in HI
self-absorption. Both phenomena match what would be expected based on our
measurements of <kappa> and T(cool).

thermal origin, although in a few objects an additional contribution from a
non-thermal component is plausible in the long wavelength bands. In a
colour-colour diagram these objects span a wide range of properties from
AGN-dominated to ULIRG-like. The far-IR composite spectrum of the quasar
population presents a broad far-IR bump between 10 and 30 micron and a sharp
drop at wavelengths greater than 100 micron in the quasar restframe. The amount
of energy emitted in the far-IR, is on average a few times larger than that
emitted in the blue and the ratio L(FIR)/L(B) increases with the bolometric
luminosity. Objects with fainter blue magnitudes have larger ratios between the
far-IR (wavelengths > 60 micron) fluxes and the blue band flux, which is
attributed to extinction by dust around the central source. No relation between
the blue absolute magnitude and the dust colour temperature is seen, suggesting
that the dominant source of FIR energy could be linked to a concurrent
starburst rather than to gravitational energy produced by the central engine.

cosmological evolution of galaxies. In this review, I discuss and summarize
results of mid-infrared ISOCAM and far-infrared ISOPHOT surveys, and show how
our vision of the extragalactic infrared universe has become more accurate. In
particular, ISO allowed us to resolve into sources a significant fraction of
the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) in the mid-infrared, and to probe a
fainter population in the far-infrared with the detection of the CIB
fluctuations. Together with other wavelength data sets, the nature of ISO
galaxies is now in the process of being understood. I also show that the high
quality of the ISO data put strong constraints on the scenarios of galaxy
evolution. This induced a burst in the development of models, yielding to a
more coherent picture of galaxy evolution. I finally emphasize the potential of
the ISO data archive in the field of observational cosmology, and describe the
next steps, in particular the forthcoming cosmological surveys to be carried
out by SIRTF.

electron-ion plasmas, focusing on the effect of vacuum polarization due to
quantum electrodynamics. This study is directly relevant to thermal radiation
from the surfaces of highly magnetized neutron stars, which have been detected
in recent years. Strong-field vacuum polarization modifies the photon
propagation modes in the plasma, and induces a ``vacuum resonance'' at which a
polarized X-ray photon propagating outward in the neutron star atmosphere can
convert from a low-opacity mode to a high-opacity mode and vice versa. The
effectiveness of this mode conversion depends on the photon energy and the
atmosphere density gradient. For a wide range of field strengths, $7\times
10^{13}< B < 10^{16}$ G, the vacuum resonance lies between the photospheres of
the two photon modes, and the emergent radiation spectrum from the neutron star
is significantly modified by the vacuum resonance. (For lower field strengths,
only the polarization spectrum is affected.) Under certain conditions, which
depend on the field strength, photon energy and propagation direction, the
vacuum resonance is accompanied by the phenomenon of mode collapse (at which
the two photon modes become degenerate) and the breakdown of Faraday
depolarization. Thus, the widely used description of radiative transfer based
on photon modes is not adequate to treat the vacuum polarization effect
rigorously. We study the evolution of polarized X-rays across the vacuum
resonance and derive the transfer equation for the photon intensity matrix
(Stokes parameters), taking into account the effect of birefringence of the
plasma-vacuum medium, free-free absorption, and scatterings by electrons and
ions.

400 times lower than the accretion luminosity resulting from the estimated
Bondi mass accretion rate and a radiative efficiency of 10%. On the parsec
scale a jet and a counter-jet extend out from a central unresolved ``core'' in
the 8.4 GHz image. Their orientation is in good agreement with that of the
large scale jets and their bulk speed is relativistic. The parsec scale
spectrum is convex over 2-22 GHz. The observed nuclear luminosity is not likely
to be reconciled with the accretion luminosity by assuming that Compton thick
material surrounds the nucleus. Low radiative efficiency accretion flow models
(ADAF and its variants) cannot account for the observed emission and spectral
shape of the nucleus in the radio band. The power in the jets accounts for a
sizable fraction (\ga 10%) of the accretion luminosity; therefore the mass
accretion rate needs not to be much different from the estimate obtained using
Bondi's theory. A jet dominated origin also for the observed radiative losses
of the nucleus is suggested. This could also explain the finding that a nuclear
luminosity orders of magnitude lower than that of ``normal'' radio loud AGNs is

rate. Models are presented for three scenarios: bulges and disks of equal age,
old bulges and delayed disk star formation, and old disks with subsequent bulge
star formation. We quantitatively show that bulge-to-total ($=$ B/T) light

the rate of increase slightly depending on the relative ages of the two

show that the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations in neutralino CDM has

kinetic decoupling of neutralinos, non-equilibrium processes constitute
viscosity effects, which damp or even absorb density perturbations in CDM.
After the last scattering of neutralinos, free streaming induces neutralino
flows from overdense to underdense regions of space. Both damping mechanisms
together define a minimal mass scale for perturbations in neutralino CDM,
before the inhomogeneities enter the nonlinear epoch of structure formation. We
find that the very first gravitationally bound neutralino clouds ought to have

the run-away Wolf-Rayet (WR) star WR 124 is presented. We found that it has
been interacting with the surrounding ISM and has formed a bow shock due to its
high velocity of about 180 km/s relative to the local ISM. The star is about
1.3 parsec away from the front of this bow shock. The outbursts that are
responsible for the nebula are assumed to be discrete outbursts that occurred
inside this bow shock. The ejecta collide with this bow shock shortly after the
outburst. After the collision, they are dragged away by the pressure of the
ISM, along the surface of the bow shock. The bow shock is oriented in such way
that we are looking from the rear into this paraboloid, almost along the main
axis. Evidence for this is given firstly by the fact that the far hemisphere is
much brighter than the near hemisphere, secondly by the fact that there is
hardly any emission found with radial velocities higher than the star's radial
velocity, thirdly by the fact that the star looks to be in the centre of the
nebula, as seen from Earth, and finally by the asymmetric overall velocity
distribution of the nebula, which indicates higher radial velocities in the
centre of the nebula, and lower velocities near the edges. We find evidence for
at least two discrete outbursts that occurred inside this bow shock. For these
outbursts, we find expansion velocities of about 150 km/s and dynamical
timescales of about 8 and 20 kyr, which are typical values for LBV outbursts.
We therefore conclude that M1-67 originates from several outbursts that
occurred inside the bow shock around WR 124, during an LBV phase that preceded
the current WR phase of the star.

to S_{F;sigma} (the Fermi surface of the fermions with spin index sigma, sigma

are bound to satisfy certain inequalities implied by the requirement of the
stability of the ground state of the system. These inequalities restrict the
range of variation of n_{sigma}(k) for k infinitesimally inside and outside the

range of variation of the zero-temperature limit of n_{sigma}(k) for k on

n_{sigma}(k) pertaining to the Hubbard and the t-J Hamiltonian, we conclude
that, at least in the strong-coupling regime, the metallic ground states of H

marginal-Fermi liquids. We further rigorously identify the pseudo-gap

ferromagnetism in graphitic materials, by making use of meteoritic graphite,
which is strongly ferromagnetic at room temperature. We examined ten samples of
extraterrestrial graphite from a nodule in the Canyon Diablo meteorite.
Graphite is the major phase in every sample but there are minor amounts of
magnetite, kamacite, akaganeite, and other phases. By analysing the phase
composition of a series of samples, we find that these iron-rich minerals can
only account for about two-thirds of the observed magnetization. The remainder
is somehow associated with graphite, corresponding to an average magnetization
of 23 Am2kg-1, or 0.05 Bohr magnetons per carbon atom. The magnetic ordering

proximity effect induced at the interface with magnetite or kamacite

suggest a Yb3+ ground state with predominantly localized 4f electrons subject
to (i) a crystalline electric field (CEF) potential, and (ii) a Kondo
interaction, which at low temperatures is about an order of magnitude smaller
than the CEF interaction. From an analysis of the dynamic magnetic response we

similar anisotropy to that in other RNi2B2C compounds, but is uniformly
enhanced by almost a factor of 2. The static and dynamic magnetic properties of
YbNi2B2C are found to be reconciled quite well by means of an approximation
scheme to the Anderson impurity model, and this procedure also indicates that
the effective Kondo interaction varies with temperature due to the crystal
field splitting. We discuss the nature of the correlated-electron ground state

critical current is reached and a dissipative phase slip occurs that lowers the
current. The phase slip phenomena is examined as a function of the strength of
the {\it emf}, thermal noise, and normal state resistivity. Numerical and
analytic methods are used to make detailed predictions for the magnitude of
phase slips and subsequent dissipation.

eads to a stronger, stiffer sample after cooling down. The material behavior is

a fast relaxation towards equilibrium for irregularly connected systems. We
analyse the transition from dipole coupled islands at low coverages to a
strongly connected ferromagnetic film at high coverages during film growth. For
coverages below the percolation threshold, the dipole interaction induces a
collective magnetic order with ordering temperatures of 1 - 10 K for the

detail a question that, for a quarter of a century, remained open despite
intense study by various researchers. Is the formula XCB =
e(x,e(e(e(x,y),e(z,y)),z)) a single axiom for the classical equivalential
calculus when the rules of inference consist of detachment (modus ponens) and
substitution? Where the function e represents equivalence, this calculus can be
axiomatized quite naturally with the formulas e(x,x), e(e(x,y),e(y,x)), and
e(e(x,y),e(e(y,z),e(x,z))), which correspond to reflexivity, symmetry, and
transitivity, respectively. (We note that e(x,x) is dependent on the other two
axioms.) Heretofore, thirteen shortest single axioms for classical equivalence
of length eleven had been discovered, and XCB was the only remaining formula of
that length whose status was undetermined. To show that XCB is indeed such a
single axiom, we focus on the rule of condensed detachment, a rule that
captures detachment together with an appropriately general, but restricted,
form of substitution. The proof we present in this paper consists of
twenty-five applications of condensed detachment, completing with the deduction
of transitivity followed by a deduction of symmetry. We also discuss some
factors that may explain in part why XCB resisted relinquishing its treasure
for so long. Our approach relied on diverse strategies applied by the automated
reasoning program OTTER. Thus ends the search for shortest single axioms for
the equivalential calculus.

permittivity and permeability of empty space are decreasing adiabatically, and
the light is accelerating therefore, as a consequence of the progressive
attenuation of the quantum vacuum due to the combined effect of its
gravitational interaction with all the expanding universe and the fourth
Heisenberg relation. It is suggested that the spaceships do not have any extra
acceleration (but follow the unchanged Newton laws), the observed effect being
due to an adiabatic acceleration of the light equal to $a_P$, which has the

in half and the bremsstrahlung calculation leads to a 10% shift of the position

decay mode G->ee, using a conservative model. This work extends the study of
the ee channel over the full accessible parameter space, and shows that the
reach could extend as high as 3.5 TeV. It then discusses ways in which the
expected universal coupling of the resonance can be confirmed using other decay
modes. In particular, the mode G-> di-photons is shown to be measurable with
good precision, which would provide powerful confirmation of the graviton
hypothesis. The decays G-> mu mu, WW, ZZ and jet--jet are measurable over a
more limited range of couplings and masses. Using information from mass and
cross-section measurements, the underlying parameters can be extracted. In one
test model, the size of the extra dimension can be determined to a precision in

is very susceptible to small changes in temperature, we investigate the effect
of the presence of such baryonic lumps on the dynamics of quark-hadron

significant overdensities. Consequently, we argue that baryon concentration in

on a polarized target and inclusive $W$ production in polarized hadron-hadron

asymmetries. It has recently been shown that QCD final-state interactions due
to gluon exchange between the struck quark and the proton spectators in
semi-inclusive deep inelastic lepton scattering will produce non-zero
Sivers-type single-spin asymmetries which survive in the Bjorken limit. We show
that this QCD final-state interaction produces identical SSAs in charged and
neutral current reactions. Furthermore, the contribution of each quark to the
SSA from this mechanism is proportional to the contribution of that quark to
the polarized baryon's anomalous magnetic moment. In contrast, the Collins
effect contribution to SSAs depends on the transversity distribution of quarks
in the polarized target. Since the charged current only couples to quarks of
one chirality, it cannot sense the transversity distribution of the target, and
thus it gives no Collins-type contribution to single-spin correlations.

directions transverse to the +,- light-cone and s axes in the second four

(+,-;4,0). These are constructed in two ways. The first uses a boundary state
formalism which implements appropriate fermionic gluing conditions and the
second is based on a direct quantisation of the open strings ending on the
branes. In distinction to the D-branes considered earlier these have massless
world-volume fermions but do not possess kinematical supersymmetries. Cylinder
diagrams describing the overlap between a pair of boundary states displaced by
some distance are evaluated. The open-string description of this system
involves mode frequencies that are, in general, given by irrational solutions
to transcendental equations. The closed-string and open-string descriptions are
shown to be equivalent by a nontrivial implementation of the S modular
transformation. A classical description of the D-instanton (the (0,0) case) in
light-cone gauge is also given.

supersymmetric regularization scheme, since the classically supersymmetric
action does not need any counterterm to preserve worldline supersymmetry. We
apply this regularization scheme to the worldline description of Dirac fermions
coupled to gravity. We first compute the trace anomaly of a Dirac fermion in 4
dimensions, providing an additional check on the regularization with finite
propagation time. Then we come to the main topic and consider the one-loop
effective action for a Dirac field in a gravitational background. We describe
how to represent this effective action as a worldline path integral and compute
explicitly the one- and two-point correlation functions, i.e. the spin 1/2
particle contribution to the graviton tadpole and graviton self-energy. These
results are presented for the general case of a massive fermion. It is
interesting to note that in the worldline formalism the coupling to gravity can
be described entirely in terms of the metric, avoiding the introduction of a
vielbein. Consequently, the fermion--graviton vertices are always linear in the
graviton, just like the standard coupling of fermions to gauge fields.

master equations for birth/death processes -- found in many fields of physics,

However, the usual expansion is not exact in the presence of boundary terms,
which commonly occur when the differential equations are nonlinear. In this
paper, a gauge Poisson technique is introduced that eliminates boundary terms,
to give an exact representation as a weighted rate equation with stochastic
terms. These methods provide novel techniques for calculating and understanding
the effects of number correlations in systems that have a master equation
description. As examples, correlations induced by strong mutations in genetics,
and the astrophysical problem of molecule formation on microscopic grain
surfaces are analyzed. Exact analytic results are obtained that can be compared
with numerical simulations, demonstrating that stochastic gauge techniques can
give exact results where standard Poisson expansions are not able to.

may precess rapidly enough in the wire's magnetic field to justify an adiabatic
approximation, eliminating the rapid time dependence of the magnetic moment and
leaving only the particle position as a slow degree of freedom. To zeroth order
in the adiabatic expansion, the orbits of the particle in the plane
perpendicular to the wire are Keplerian ellipses. Higher order post-adiabatic
corrections make the orbits precess, but recent analysis of this `vector Kepler
problem' has shown that the effective Hamiltonian incorporating a
post-adiabatic scalar potential (`geometric electromagnetism') fails to predict
the precession correctly, while a heuristic alternative succeeds. In this paper
we resolve the apparent failure of the post-adiabatic approximation, by
pointing out that the correct second-order analysis produces a third
Hamiltonian, in which geometric electromagnetism is supplemented by a tensor
potential. The heuristic Hamiltonian of Schmiedmayer and Scrinzi is then shown
to be a canonical transformation of the correct adiabatic Hamiltonian, to
second order. The transformation has the important advantage of removing a
$1/r^3$ singularity which is an artifact of the adiabatic approximation.

The relative diffusion constants are found to vary in the order $D_R^{BB} >
D_R^{AB} > D_R^{AA}$, with $D_R^{BB} \simeq 2D_R^{AA}$, showing the importance
of the hopping process (B hops much more than A). We introduce a non-Gaussian
parameter ($\alpha_2^P (t)$) to monitor the relative motion of a pair of atoms,
and evaluate it for all the three pairs, with initial separations chosen to be
at the first peak of the corresponding partial radial distribution functions.
At intermediate times, significant deviation from the Gaussian behavior of the
pair distribution functions is observed, with different degree for the three
pairs. A simple mean-field (MF) model, proposed originally by Haan [Phys. Rev.
A ${\bf 20}$, 2516 (1979)] for one component liquid, is applied to the case of
binary mixture, and compared with the simulation results. While the MF model
successfully describe the dynamics of the AA and AB pair, the agreement for the
BB pair is less satisfactory. This is attributed to the large scale anharmonic
motions of the B particles in a weak effective potential. Dynamics of next
nearest neighbor pairs are also investigated.

that, in contrast to Bell`s theorem for spin or polarization correlation

representation in the form of classical correlation of separated random
processes. In this sense there exists a local realistic representation for the
