numerical resolution in the Lambda CDM cosmogony. The galaxy is assembled
through a number of high-redshift mergers followed by a period of quiescent
accretion after z~1 which lead to the formation of two distinct dynamical
components: a spheroid and a disk. The surface brightness profile is very well
approximated by the superposition of an R^{1/4} spheroid and an exponential
disk. The surface brightness profile is remarkably similar to that of Sab
galaxy UGC615, but the simulated galaxy rotates significantly faster and has a
declining rotation curve dominated by the spheroid near the center. The decline
in circular velocity is at odds with observation and results from the high
concentration of the dark matter and baryonic components, as well as from the
relatively high mass-to-light ratio of the stars in the simulation. The
simulated galaxy lies ~ 1 mag off the I-band Tully-Fisher relation of late-type
spirals, but seems to be in reasonable agreement with Tully-Fisher data on S0
galaxies. The angular momentum of the luminous component is an order of
magnitude lower than that of late-type spirals of similar rotation speed. This
reflects the dominance of the slowly-rotating, dense spheroidal component. The
disk component, on the other hand, has properties rather similar to those of
late-type spirals. This suggests that a different form of feedback than adopted
in this simulation is required to inhibit the efficient collapse and cooling of
gas at high redshift that leads to the formation of the spheroid. Reconciling
the properties of disk galaxies with the early collapse and high merging rates
characteristic of hierarchical scenarios such as Lambda CDM remains a
challenging, yet so far elusive, proposition.

Abell 403 (z=0.10) and SN 2001al in Abell 2122/4 (z = 0.066), have no obvious
hosts. Both events appear projected on the halos of the central cD galaxies,
but have velocity offsets of 750-2000 km/s relative to those galaxies,
suggesting they are not bound to them. We use deep Keck imaging of the
locations of the two SNe to put upper limits on the luminosities of possible
dwarf hosts, M_R > -14 mag for SN 1998fc and M_R > -11.8 mag for SN 2001al. The
fractions of the cluster luminosities in dwarf galaxies fainter than our limits
are less than 3 x 10^-3 and 3 x 10^-4, respectively. Thus, 2/7 of the SNe would
be associated with less than 3 x 10^-3 of the luminosity attributed to
galaxies. We argue, instead, that the progenitors of both events were probably
members of a diffuse population of intergalactic stars, recently detected in
local clusters via planetary nebulae and red giants. Considering the higher
detectability of hostless SNe compared to normal SNe, we estimate that
20^{+12}_{-15} percent of the SN Ia parent stellar population in clusters is
intergalactic. This fraction is consistent with other measurements of the
intergalactic stellar population, and implies that the process that produces
intergalactic stars (e.g., tidal disruption of cluster dwarfs) does not disrupt
or enhance significantly the SN Ia formation mechanism. Hostless SNe are
potentially powerful tracers of the formation of the intergalactic stellar
population out to high redshift.

the matter and the geometry (metric), while highly dynamical, are unaffected by
the electromagnetic fields. The matter is assumed to be perfectly conducting
and threaded by a dipole magnetic field at the onset of collapse. We determine
the subsequent evolution of the magnetic and electric fields without
approximation; the fields are determined analytically in the matter interior
and numerically in the vacuum exterior. We apply junction conditions to match
the electromagnetic fields across the stellar surface. We use this model to
experiment with several coordinate gauge choices for handling spacetime
evolution characterized by the formation of a black hole and the associated
appearance of singularities. These choices range from ``singularity avoiding''
time coordinates to ``horizon penetrating'' time coordinates accompanied by
black hole excision. The later choice enables us to integrate the
electromagnetic fields arbitrarily far into the future. At late times the
longitudinal magnetic field in the exterior has been transformed into a
transverse electromagnetic wave; part of the electromagnetic radiation is
captured by the hole and the rest propagates outward to large distances. The
solution we present for our simple scenario can be used to test codes designed

play a major role in the alignment of grains with the interstellar magnetic

grain principal axis of greatest moment of inertia is always parallel to the
grain angular momentum. This enabled us to describe many of the features of the
grain dynamics. However, this assumption fails when the grains enter periods of
thermal rotation, which occur naturally in the radiative torque alignment
scenario. In the present paper, we relax this assumption and explore the
consequences for the grain dynamics. We develop a treatment to follow the grain
dynamics including thermal fluctuations and ``thermal flipping'', and show
results for one illustrative example. By comparing with a treatment without
thermal fluctuations, we see that inclusion of thermal fluctuations can lead to
qualitative changes in the grain dynamics. In a future installment in this
series, we will use the more complete dynamical treatment developed here to
perform a systematic study of grain alignment by radiative torques.

halo are used to predict the number fraction of zero-metallicity, Population
III stars, which currently is empirically estimated at < 4e-4. These analytic
models minimize the number of free parameters, highlighting the most
fundamental constraints on halo evolution. There are disagreements of at least
an order of magnitude between observations and predictions in limiting cases
for both homogeneous Simple Model and Simple Inhomogeneous Model (SIM). Hence,
this demonstrates a quantitative, unambiguous discrepancy in the observed and
expected fraction of Population III stars. We explore how the metallicity
distribution of the parent enrichment events f(z_0) drives the SIM and
predictions for the Population III fraction. The SIM shows that the
previously-identified ""high halo"" and ""low halo"" populations are consistent
with a continuous evolutionary progression, and therefore may not necessarily
be physically distinct populations. Possible evolutionary scenarios for halo
evolution are discussed within the SIM's simplistic one-zone paradigm.
  The values of z_0 depend strongly on metal dispersal processes, thus we
investigate interstellar mixing and mass transport, for the first time
explicitly incorporating this into a semi-analytic chemical evolution model.
Diffusion is found to be inefficient for all phases, including the hot phase,
of the interstellar medium (ISM): relevant diffusion lengths are 2 - 4 orders
of magnitude smaller than corresponding length scales for turbulent mixing.
Rough relations for dispersal processes are given for multiphase ISM. These
suggest that the expected low-metallicity threshold above zero is consistent
with the currently observed limit.

observations during the post-MAP era. The curl-modes of CMB polarization allow
a direct detection of inflationary gravitational waves and a measurement of the

from cosmic shear conversion of polarization related to density perturbations,
higher resolution observations of CMB anisotropies can be used for a lensing
reconstruction and to separate gravitational-wave polarization signature from
that of lensing. With perfect all-sky maps, separations based on current
lensing reconstruction techniques allow the possibility to probe inflationary
energy scales down to 10^15 GeV, well below that of grand unified theories.
Another aspect of future CMB studies will be related to large scale structure,
such as wide-field imaging of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in galaxy

of 135 h^{-1}_{50} kpc from the group centre. The spectrum within this region
is well modelled by a thermal plasma with a temperature of 0.49+/-0.17 keV, and
a non-zero metallicity. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of 9.6 10{^40}
h^{-2}_{50} erg/s which may be only a small fraction of the total luminosity
because of the limit in spatial detection arising from the high background
level. Despite its low temperature and luminosity, HCG 16 obeys the Lx-T
relation obtained for brighter galaxy groups even if it lies in a very extreme

HCG 16 even if the gas trapped in the potential well may not yet be virialized.

groups, and on their role in a more general cosmological context.

core of extent 30'' immediately surrounding the pulsar, embedded in a fainter,
diffuse component of emission 5' in extent, seen only on the southern side of
the pulsar. The pulsar itself is not detected, either as a point source or
through its pulsations. Both components of the X-ray emission are well fit by a
power law spectrum, with photon index Gamma ~ 1.6 and X-ray luminosity (0.5-10

wind. We propose that the asymmetric morphology of the diffuse emission with
respect to the pulsar is the result of a reverse shock from an associated
supernova remnant, which has compressed and distorted the pulsar-powered
nebula. Such an interaction might be typical for pulsars at this stage in their
evolution. The associated supernova remnant is not detected directly, most
likely being too faint to be seen in existing X-ray and radio observations.

motions associated with the gravitational collapse of nonlinear structures.
Estimated speed and curvature radius of these shocks could be as large as a few
1000 km/s and several Mpc, respectively. According to the diffusive shock
acceleration theory, populations of cosmic-ray particles can be injected and
accelerated to very high energy by astrophysical shocks in tenuous plasmas. In
order to explore the cosmic ray acceleration at the cosmic shocks, we have
performed nonlinear numerical simulations of cosmic ray (CR) modified shocks
with the newly developed CRASH (Cosmic Ray Amr SHock) numerical code. We
adopted the Bohm diffusion model for CRs, based on the hypothesis that strong
Alfv\'en waves are self-generated by streaming CRs. The shock formation
simulation includes a plasma-physics-based ``injection'' model that transfers a
small proportion of the thermal proton flux through the shock into low energy
CRs for acceleration there. We found that, for strong accretion shocks, CRs can
absorb most of shock kinetic energy and the accretion shock speed is reduced up
to 20 %, compared to pure gas dynamic shocks. For merger shocks with small Mach
numbers, however, the energy transfer to CRs is only about 10-20 % with an
associated CR particle fraction of $10^{-3}$. Nonlinear feedback due to the CR
pressure is insignificant in the latter shocks. Although detailed results
depend on models for the particle diffusion and injection, these calculations
show that cosmic shocks in large scale structure could provide acceleration
sites of extragalactic cosmic rays of the highest energy.

that the new extremum-state of Tsallis entropy essentially remains unchanged

be described by the stellar polytrope. While the thermodynamic stability for a
system confined in an adiabatic wall completely agrees with the previous study

five dimensions, the model exhibits a single spin-glass transition at a finite
temperature, where the spin-glass order accompanying the simultaneous
chiral-glass order sets in. In four dimensions, by contrast, the model exhibits
a chiral-glass transition at a finite temperature, not accompanying the
standard spin-glass order. The critical region associated with the chiral-glass
transition, however, is very narrow, suggesting that dimension four is close to
the marginal dimensionality.

interference (QI) effect is studied with the diagrammatic technique in
weakly-disordered two-dimensional crystals with nearly half-filled bands. In
addition to the usual 0-mode cooperon and diffuson, there exist $\pi$-mode
cooperon and diffuson in the unitary limit due to the particle-hole symmetry.
The diffusive $\pi$-modes are gapped by the deviation from the exactly-nested
Fermi surface. The conductivity diagrams with the gapped $\pi$-mode cooperon or
diffuson are found to give rise to unconventional features of the QI effect.
Besides the inelastic scattering, the thermal fluctuation is shown to be also
an important dephasing mechanism in the QI processes related with the diffusive
$\pi$-modes. In the proximity of the nesting case, a power-law
anti-localization effect appears due to the $\pi$-mode diffuson. For large
deviation from the nested Fermi surface, this anti-localization effect is
suppressed, and the conductivity remains to have the usual logarithmic
weak-localization correction contributed by the 0-mode cooperon. As a result,
the dc conductivity in the unitary limit becomes a non-monotonic function of
the temperature or the sample size, which is quite different from the
prediction of the usual weak-localization theory.

nontrivial topological sector. With this aim, we consider numerical
minimization of the action with respect to the global color orientation, the
anisotropic scale transformation and the local gauge-like transformation
starting from a simple superposed gauge field of the 't Hooft ansatz and the
external color field. Here, the external color field is, for simplicity, chosen
to be a constant Abelian magnetic field along a certain direction. Then, the
4-dimensional rotational symmetry O(4) of the instanton solution is reduced to
two 2-dimensional rotational symmetries $O(2)\times O(2)$ due to the effect of
a homogeneous external field. In the space $\mib{R}^{3}$ at fixed $t$, we find
a quadrupole deformation of this instanton solution. In the presence of a
magnetic field $\vec{H}$, a prolate deformation occurs along the direction of
$\vec{H}$. Contrastingly, in the presence of an electric field $\vec{E}$ an
oblate deformation occurs along the direction of $\vec{E}$. We further discuss
the local correlation between the instanton and the monopole in the external
field in the maximally Abelian gauge. The external field affects the appearance
of the monopole trajectory around the instanton. In fact, a monopole and
anti-monopole pair appears around the instanton center, and this monopole loop
seems to partially screen the external field.

differential equations for a sequence of functions, the solutions of which give
closed form expressions for the sum of all leading logs, next to leading logs
and subsequent subleading logarithmic contributions to the effective action.
The renormalization group is thus shown to provide information about a model
beyond the scale dependence of the model's couplings and masses. This procedure
is illustrated using the $\phi_6^3$ model and Yang-Mills theory. In the latter
instance, it is also shown by using a modified summation procedure that the
$\mu$ dependence of the effective action resides solely in a multiplicative
factor of $g^2 (\mu)$ (the running coupling). This approach is also shown to
lead to a novel expansion for the running coupling in terms of the one-loop
coupling that does not require an order-by-order redefinition of the scale
factor $\Lambda_{QCD}$. Finally, logarithmic contributions of the instanton
size to the effective action of an SU(2) gauge theory are summed, allowing a
determination of the asymptotic dependence on the instanton size $\rho$ as
$\rho$ goes to infinity to all orders in the SU(2) coupling constant.

Type II, the Chern-Simons term is not enough to cancel all localized anomalies
even if they are globally vanishing. We also find that for the consistent
embedding of brane fields, there appear only the localized log FI terms at the
fixed point(s) with a U(1) factor.

light front staggered formulation and the Wilson fermion formulation. The

subjected to a constant vertical force and bounces inelastically on a

circular scatterers that are very shallow, hence this billiard is a
deterministic diffusive version of the well-known bouncing ball problem on a
flat vibrating plate. Computer simulations show that the diffusion coefficient
of this system is a highly irregular function of the vibration frequency
exhibiting pronounced maxima whenever there are resonances between the
vibration frequency and the average time of flight of a particle. In addition
there exist irregularities on finer scales that are due to higher-order
dynamical correlations pointing towards a fractal structure of this curve. We
analyze the diffusive dynamics by classifying the attracting sets and by
working out a simple random walk approximation for diffusion, which is
systematically refined by using a Green-Kubo formula.

a phenomenological approach proposed by Peitzmann for converting the results of
$NN(PP)$ reactions to those for either $PA$ or $AA$ collisions, and a specific

sections. This grand combination of models(GCM) is then applied to analyse the

qualitative agreement between measurements and calculations on both the

well, is quite satisfactory. The modest successes that we achieve here in
dealing with the massive data-sets are somewhat encouraging in view of the
diversity of the reactions and the very wide range of interaction energies.

considered here to be multicomponent solidification. This is a unified
alternative approach to the present interpretations where each layer is
reasoned and matched individually. The Earth's solidification is modelled using
the ternary phase diagram Fe-Si-Ni. The four cotectic concentrations and the
four corresponding seismic discontinuity radii have been used to show that the
silicon concentration as a function of the distance R from the centre of the
Earth can be modelled by C(Si) = G(R/Re)(R/Re) where G = 0.583, Re is the
Earth's radius and the Ni/Fe ratio is 0.072. Earth would have up to 13
chemically different layers. This model predicts that there are three to four
chemically slightly different sublayers in the D"" layer and two boundaries in
the inner core at radii 870 km and 1050 km. The observed hemispheric asymmetry
in the inner core could follow if the Ni-concentration slightly varies locally.
Although this model can account for all the layers using only three elements it
can not, of course, match the full chemistry of the real Earth.

are implemented using the Sorensen-Molmer (SM) scheme applied to pairs of ions

dephasing. Decoupling pulses, that are also implemented using the SM scheme
directly to the encoded qubits, are capable of further reducing various other
sources of qubit decoherence, such as due to differential dephasing and due to
decohered vibrational modes. The feasibility of using the relatively slow SM
pulses in a decoupling scheme quenching the latter source of decoherence
follows from the observed 1/f spectrum of the vibrational bath.
