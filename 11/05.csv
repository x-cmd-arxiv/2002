considerable light on the nature of the outflows in this region. The
combination of our CO, SiO and radio data suggest that there are perhaps as
many as four outflows emanating from the core containing G35.2--0.7N. The most
striking result is that the radio jet is ruled out as the driving source of the
large-scale CO flow. The jet drives its own highly-collimated CO outflow.
Molecular line emission from H13CN and H13CO+ peaks towards the centre of the
large-scale CO outflow, but no radio source is detected within. A third flow
may be seen in SiO emission, which appears to be centred on another peak in
H13CO+. The fourth flow is not seen in CO or SiO, but is inferred from previous
L'-band data and the discovery of a radio source at the proposed centre of this
flow.

gain energy from the co-rotating electric field of the magnetosphere, and leave
Jupiter with escape speeds over $\rm 200 km s^{-1}$. The dust streams were also
observed by the Galileo and Cassini spacecraft. While Ulysses and Cassini only
had a single encounter with Jupiter, Galileo has continuously monitored the
dust streams in the Jovian magnetosphere since 1996. The observed dust fluxes
exhibit large orbit-to-orbit variability due to both systematic and stochastic
changes. By combining the entire data set, the variability due to stochatic

time is found. This result is consistent with theoretical expectations and
confirms that the majority of the Jovian dust stream particles originate from

correspondence limit of the Schr\""odinger equation. The resulting formalism is
equivalent to using the collisionless Boltzman (or Vlasov) equations which
remain valid during the whole evolution, even after shell crossing. Other
formulations of perturbation theory explicitly break down at shell crossing,
e.g. Eulerean perturbation theory, which describes gravitational collapse in
the fluid limit. This paper lays the groundwork by introducing the new
formalism, calculating the perturbation theory kernels which form the basis of
all subsequent calculations. We also establish the connection with conventional
perturbation theories, by showing that third order tree level results, such as
bispectrum, skewness, cumulant correlators, three-point function are exactly
reproduced in the appropriate expansion of our results. We explicitly show that
cumulants up to N=5 predicted by Eulerian perturbation theory for the dark
matter field $\delta$ are exactly recovered in the corresponding limit. A
logarithmic mapping of the field naturally arises in the Schr\""odinger context,
which means that tree level perturbation theory translates into (possibly
incomplete) loop corrections for the conventional perturbation theory. We show
that the first loop correction for the variance is $\sigma^2 = \sigma_L^2+
(-1.14+n)\sigma_L^4$ for a field with spectral index $n$. This yields 1.86 and
0.86 for $n=-3,-2$ respectively, and to be compared with the exact loop order
corrections 1.82, and 0.88. Thus our tree-level theory recovers the dominant
part of first order loop corrections of the conventional theory, while
including (partial) loop corrections to infinite order in terms of $\delta$.

upper limits on the break radius well below the values observed for core
galaxies of the same luminosity. These results support the idea that the
central structure of early-type galaxies is bimodal in its physical properties,
but also suggest that there exist high luminosity galaxies with power-law
profiles (or unusually small cores). The BCGs in the latter category tend to
fall at the low end of the BCG luminosity function and tend to have low values
of the quantity alpha (the logarithmic slope of the metric luminosity as a
function of radius, at 10 kpc). Since theoretical calculations have shown that
the luminosities and alpha values of BCGs grow with time as a result of
accretion, this suggests a scenario in which elliptical galaxies evolve from
power-law profiles to core profiles through accretion and merging. This is

is significantly variable in all bands. On average, the variability amplitude
increases from ~5% in the I band, to ~5.5% in the R and ~6.5% in the B band
light curves. The rising and decaying time scales are comparable within each

power spectrum shows a red noise component with a slope of ~ -2.
Cross-correlation analysis shows that in most cases the delay between the

cross-correlation functions are asymmetric, implying complex delays of the I
band variations with respect to the B band variations. Furthermore, in one case
we find that the I band variations are significantly delayed (by ~0.2 hrs) with

variations: the spectrum becomes steeper as the flux increases, and the
flattest spectral index corresponds to the maximum B band flux. Our results
imply that the fast, intra-night variations of the source correspond to
perturbations of different regions in the jet which cause localized injections
of relativistic particles on time scales much sorter that the average sampling
interval of the light curves. The variations are controlled by the cooling and
light crossing time scales, which are probably comparable.

low-mass stars. The comparison reveals that most evolutionary models
underestimate the radius of the stars by as much as 10%, thus confirming the
trend observed by Torres & Ribas (2002) for YY Gem and V818 Tau. In the
mass-absolute magnitude diagram, CU Cnc is observed to be dimmer than other
stars of the same mass. After ruling out a number of different scenarios, the
apparent faintness of CU Cnc can be explained if its components are some 10%
cooler than similar-mass stars or if there is some source of circumstellar dust
absorption. The latter could be a tantalizing indirect evidence for a coplanar

massive discs, which are likely to be present at an earlier stage of the star

within a factor of two of that predicted using a local model. These results

square and triangle lattices, the SU(4) Schwinger bosons condense at
(\pi/2,\pi/2) and (\pi/3,\pi/3), respectively. Spin, orbital, and coupled
spin-orbital static susceptibilities become singular at the wave vectors, twice
of which the bose condensation arises at. It is also demonstrated that there
are spin, orbital, and coupled spin-orbital long-range orderings in the ground

the important role of 1-d systems [stripes] was emphasized and moreover the
relationship between quantum groups and strings via WZWN models were given in
[Phys. Lett A272, (2000)]. In this brief note we give and discuss mathematical
proof of this conjecture, which completes an important part of this idea, since
previously an explicit simple mathematical proof was lacking. Moreover an
independent calculation [IC/99/2] which constructs the generators forming SO(5)
algebra not only supports our previous conjecture but provides a check on our
calculations. It is important to note that in terms of physics that the
arbitariness [freedom] of the d-wave factor g$^{2}$(k) is tied to quantum group
symmetry whereas in order to recover classical SO(5) one must set it to unity
in an adhoc manner. We intuitively expect that this freedom may be related to
psuedogap behaviour in cuprates.

mixtures under oscillatory shear flow in two dimensions. The algorithm allows
to simulate systems whose dynamics is described by the Navier-Stokes and the
convection-diffusion equations. The interplay between several time scales
produces a rich and complex phenomenology. We investigate the effects of
different oscillation frequencies and viscosities on the morphology of the
phase separating domains. We find that at high frequencies the evolution is
almost isotropic with growth exponents 2/3 and 1/3 in the inertial (low
viscosity) and diffusive (high viscosity) regimes, respectively. When the
period of the applied shear flow becomes of the same order of the relaxation
time $T_R$ of the shear velocity profile, anisotropic effects are clearly
observable. In correspondence with non-linear patterns for the velocity
profiles, we find configurations where lamellar order close to the walls
coexists with isotropic domains in the middle of the system. For particular
values of frequency and viscosity it can also happen that the convective
effects induced by the oscillations cause an interruption or a slowing of the
segregation process, as found in some experiments. Finally, at very low
frequencies, the morphology of domains is characterized by lamellar order
everywhere in the system resembling what happens in the case with steady shear.

irrelevant chiral 4-fermion interaction and two massless quark flavours, on

4-fermion interaction was reduced to half the minimum value used in previous
simulations, to study how the nature of this phase transition depends on this
additional interaction. We find that the transition remains first order as the
4-fermion coupling is reduced. Extending our earlier studies indicates that for
sufficiently large 4-fermion coupling, the transition is probably second order.

neutralino dark matter and other experiments have on the SUSY parameter space
for the mSUGRA model and for models with non-universal soft breaking at the GUT
scale. In mSUGRA, the allowed amount of dark matter restricts the SUSY
parameter space to a narrow band in m_0 - m_{1/2} (except at very large
\tan\beta). The Higgs mass and b-> s\gamma constraints produce a lower bound of
m_{1/2}>~{\sim} 300GeV and if the muon magnetic moment anomaly can be
interpreted as a 3\sigma deviation from the Standard Model, one also obtains an
upper bound of m_{1/2} <~900 GeV, making the SUSY spectrum well accessible to
the LHC. The B_s->\mu \mu decay is seen to be accessible to the Tevatron Run2B
with 15 fb^{-1} for \tan\beta>~30. However, only parts of the spectrum will be
accessible to the NLC if it's energy is below 800GeV. Non-universal soft
breaking opens new regions of parameter space. Thus the m_{1/2} lower bound
constraint of b->s\gamma and also the Higgs mass can be reduced greatly if the
gluino mass is assumed larger at the GUT scale (allowing for a lighter gaugino
spectrum), and non-universal Higgs soft breaking masses at the GUT scale can
open new allowed regions at relatively low m_{1/2} and high m_0 where dark
matter detection cross sections may be increased by a factor of ten or more.

dynamics of tachyons in dS$_d$. We discuss this correspondence both at the
level of the solution of the field equations and of the Green functions. The

significant implications for experimental testability is the one concerning the

alternative formulas. While in these previous studies the relation between
group velocity and momentum was introduced through ad hoc formulas, we rely on
a direct analysis of wave propagation in $\kappa$-Minkowski. Our results lead
conclusively to the relation $v = dE(p)/dp$. We also show that the previous

significantly different from the radial distributions extracted from the data

coordination number distribution that can be examined for metastable
coordination structures suggesting possibilities for clathrate-like
organization; none are seen in these results. Clathrate pictures of hydrophobic
hydration are discussed, as is the quasi-chemical theory that should provide a
basis for clathrate pictures. Outer shell contributions are discussed and
accurately estimated; they are positive and larger than the positive
experimental hydration free energy of Kr(aq), implying that inner shell
contributions must be negative. Clathrate-like inner shell coordination
structures extracted from the simulation of the liquid, and then subjected to
quantum chemical optimization, always decomposed. Interactions with the outer
shell material are decisive in stabilizing coordination structures observed in
liquid solution and in clathrate phases. The ``what are we to tell students''
question about hydrophobic hydration, often answered with structural models
such as clathrate pictures, is then considered; we propose an alternative
answer that is consistent with successful molecular theories of hydrophobic
effects and based upon distinctive observable properties of liquid water.

additional structural hypotheses in response to ``what are we to tell

exerted on a charged particle should remain unchanged when observed in
different reference frames in uniform translational motion. In the special
relativity, this invariance is achieved by invoking the Lorentz transformation
of space and time. In this investigation an entirely different interpretation
of the invariance of force is presented. We propose a new model of the
electromagnetic force given in terms of the augmented potentials, which are
derived from the electric scalar potential by incorporating a velocity
difference between involved particles. The propagation of the potentials is
supposed to follow the local-ether model. All of the position vectors, time
derivatives, and velocities involved in the proposed potentials and force law
are referred specifically to their respective frames. By virtue of this
feature, the electromagnetic force is independent of reference frame simply
based on Galilean transformations. The proposed model looks quite different
from the Lorentz force law, except the electrostatic force. However, under the
common low-speed condition where the mobile charged particles forming the
current drift very slowly in a neutralizing matrix, it is shown that the
proposed model reduces to the Lorentz force law, if the latter is observed in
the matrix frame as done tacitly in common practice.

allows us to approach the trapping conditions of a Paul trap, but without any
micromotion. Using an ICCD camera we show that the motion of a single ion can
be confined to dimensions of the order of 10 $\mu$m. We have measured increased
magnetron cooling rates using an rf-photon correlation technique. For certain
laser cooling conditions, the magnetron motion of the centre of mass of the
cloud grows and stabilises at a large value. This results in the ions orbiting
the centre of the trap together in a small cloud, as confirmed by photon-photon
correlation measurements.
