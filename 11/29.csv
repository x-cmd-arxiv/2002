energy on CMB anisotropies. The generalized Chaplygin gas is a fluid component
with an exotic equation of state, $p = - A/\rho^\alpha$ (a polytropic gas with
negative constant and exponent). Such component interpolates in time between
dust and a cosmological constant, with an intermediate behaviour as $p=\alpha
\rho$. Perturbations of this fluid are stable on small scales, but behave in a
very different way with respect to standard quintessence. Moreover, a
generalized Chaplygin gas could also represent an archetypal example of a
phenomenological unified models of dark energy and dark matter. The results
presented here show how the CMB anisotropies induced by this class of models
differ from a $\Lambda$CDM model.

vigorous turbulence leading to angular momentum transport in Keplerian
accretion disks. We show by analytical considerations and three-dimensional
radiation hydro simulations that, in particular, protoplanetary disks have a
negative radial entropy gradient, which makes them baroclinic. Two-dimensional
numerical simulations show that a baroclinic flow is unstable and produces
turbulence. These findings are tested for numerical effects by performing a
simulation with a barotropic initial condition which shows that imposed
turbulence rapidly decays. The turbulence in baroclinic disks transports
angular momentum outward and creates a radially inward bound accretion of
matter. Potential energy is released and excess kinetic energy is dissipated.
Finally the reheating of the gas supports the radial entropy gradient, forming
a self consistent process. We measure accretion rates in our 2D and 3D
simulations of dotM= - 1E-9 - 1E-7 Msun/yr and viscosity parameters of alpha =
1E-4 - 1E-2, which fit perfectly together and agree reasonably with
observations. The turbulence creates pressure waves, Rossby waves, and vortices
in the R-phi plane of the disk. We demonstrate in a global simulation that
these vortices tend to form out of little background noise and to be
long-lasting features, which have already been suggested to lead to the
formation of planets.

samples of lenses, and detect a significant signal in all cases. The estimates
for the velocity dispersion of an L* galaxy agree well for the various samples.
The best fit singular isothermal sphere model to the ensemble averaged
tangential distortion around the galaxies with redshifts yields a velocity
dispersion of \sigma_*=130^{+15}_{-17} km/s, in good agreement with other
studies. We use a maximum likelihood analysis, where a parameterized mass model

systems (DLAs), of which 8 are at redshifts $z \ga 1.3$. HI absorption was
detected in only one DLA, the $z = 0.5318$ absorber toward PKS 1629+12, which
has been identified with a luminous spiral galaxy; the spin temperature limit
($T_s \le 310$ K) derived from our observations continues the trend of DLAs
associated with bright spirals having low spin temperatures. In 7 of the
remaining 9 systems, the observations place strong lower limits on the spin
temperature of the HI gas.
  The sample of DLAs searched for 21cm absorption now consists of 31 systems,
with $T_s$ estimates available in 24 cases; of these, 16 are at $z < 2$ and 8
at $z > 2$, with 11 (all at $z < 1$) having optical IDs. For the latter 11
systems, we find that all low $T_s$ DLAs have been identified with luminous
galaxies, while all high $T_s$ ($T_s \ga 1000$ K) DLAs have been identified
with either LSBs or dwarfs. DLA spin temperatures thus appear to correlate with
galaxy type, with no correlation seen between $T_s$ and impact parameter.
  The trend that low $z$ DLAs exhibit both high and low $T_s$ values while high
redshift ($z \ga 3$) DLAs only show high spin temperatures is present in this
expanded data set. Based on this difference in spin temperatures, the Gehan
test rules out the hypothesis that DLAs at $z > 2$ and DLAs at $z < 2$ are
drawn from the same parent population at ~ 99 % confidence level.
  Finally, we estimate upper limits on the fraction of cold HI, $f_{CNM}$, in
the $z \ga 3$ DLAs. In local spirals, $f_{CNM} \sim 0.5$; in contrast, we find
that $f_{CNM} < 0.3$ in all 7 high $z$ DLAs, with $f_{CNM} < 0.1$ in 5 of the 7
cases. (abridged)

present strong arguments that the first principal component represents the
Baldwin effect, relating equivalent widths to the luminosity (i.e. accretion
rate), but only emission-line cores are involved. The second component
represents continuum variations, probably dominated by intrinsic reddening. The
third principal component directly relates QSO UV properties to the optical
principal component 1 found by Boroson & Green (1992). It is the primary cause
of scatter in the Baldwin relationships. It is also directly related to broad
emission-line width and soft X-ray spectral index, and therefore probably
driven by Eddington accretion ratio. We demonstrate how Baldwin relationships
can be derived using our first principal component, virtually eliminating the
scatter caused by the third principal component. This rekindles the hope that
the Baldwin relationships can be used for cosmological study.

radio-halo clusters. We discuss both the spectral and the spatial features of
the total SZ effect and we provide specific predictions for a well studied
radio-halo cluster like A2163. We also discuss the overall SZ effect produced
by a combination of different thermal populations residing in the cluster
atmosphere. In this context, we discuss how the combined observations of the
thermal and non-thermal SZ effect provide constraints on the spectrum of the
relativistic electron population and, in turn, on the presence and on the
origin of non-thermal phenomena (radio-halo, hard X-ray, EUV excesses)
occurring in galaxy clusters.

to map the velocity field of the gas in its nuclear region. We detect the
presence of a compact (r~0.4"" ~40 pc), high surface brightness, rotating
nuclear disk co-spatial with a nuclear star cluster. The disk is characterized
by a rotation curve with a peak to peak amplitude of ~40 km/s and is
systematically blueshifted by 10 - 20 km/s with respect to the galaxy systemic
velocity. With the standard assumption of constant mass-to-light ratio and with
the nuclear disk inclination taken from the outer disk, we find that a dark
point mass of 1(-0.7;+0.6) 10^7 Msun is needed to reproduce the observed
rotation curve. However the observed blueshift suggests the possibility that
the nuclear disk could be dynamically decoupled. Following this line of
reasoning we relax the standard assumptions and find that the kinematical data
can be accounted for by the stellar mass provided that either the central
mass-to-light ratio is increased by a factor of ~2 or that the inclination is
allowed to vary. This model results in a 3 sigma upper limit of 6 10^6 Msun on
the mass of any nuclear black hole. Overall, our analysis only allows us to set
an upper limit of 2 10^7 Msun on the mass of the nuclear black hole. If this
upper limit is taken in conjunction with an estimated bulge B magnitude of
-17.7 and with a central stellar velocity dispersion of 95 km/s, then these
results are not inconsistent with both the MBH-Lsph and the MBH-sigma
correlations. Constraints on black hole masses in spiral galaxies of types as
late as Sbc are still very scarce and therefore the present result adds an
important new datapoint to our understanding of black hole demography.

hyperfine coupling $A$. We show that the usual treatment of the problem based
on the Markovian approximation is impossible because the correlation time for
the nuclear magnetic field seen by the electron spin is itself determined by
the flip-flop processes.
  The decay of the electron spin correlation function is not exponential but
rather power (inverse logarithm) law-like. For polarized nuclei we find an
exact solution and show that the precession amplitude and the decay behavior
can be tuned by the magnetic field. The decay time is given by $\hbar N/A$,
where $N$ is the number of nuclei inside the dot. The amplitude of precession,

  distributions and Renyi parameter","11 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  The Renyi entropy with a free Renyi parameter $q$ is the most justified form
of information entropy, and the Tsallis entropy may be regarded as a linear
approximation to the Renyi entropy when $q\simeq 1$. When $q\to 1$, both
entropies go to the Boltzmann--Shannon entropy. The application of the
principle of maximum of information entropy (MEP) to the Renyi entropy gives
rise to the microcanonical (homogeneous) distribution for an isolated system.
Whatever the value of the Renyi parameter $q$ is, in this case the Renyi
entropy becomes the Boltzmann entropy $S_B=k_B\ln W$, that provides support for
universality of the Boltzmann's principle of statistical mechanics. For a
system being in contact with a heat bath, the application of MEP to the Renyi
entropy gives rise to Levy distribution (or, $q$-distribution) accepted as one
of the main results of the so-called nonextensive statistics. The same
distribution is derived here for a small physical system experiencing
temperature fluctuations. The long--range ""tail"" of the Levy distribution is
the power--law (Zipf-Pareto) distribution with the exponent $s$ expressed via
$q$. The exponent and free Renyi parameter $q$ can be uniquely determined with
the use of a further extension of MEP. Then typical values of $s$ are found
within the range $1.3\div 2$ and of $q$ within the range $0.25\div 0.5$, in
dependence on parameters of stochastic systems.

its 'phonon' strain field and of its 'phason' strain field. In the framework of
the topological theory of defects, and the QC being defined as an irrational
subset of a high dimensional crystal, both types of defects appear as distinct
components of the same entity, a 'disvection'. Each of them can also be
described in classical terms, within a detailed analysis of the Volterra
process:(a)- the 'phonon' singularity breaks some symmetry of translation,
represented by a Burgers vector projected from the high dimensional crystal
onto the physical space; it is akin to an ordinary perfect dislocation, (b)-
the 'phason' singularities are dislocation dipoles whose Burgers vectors are of
a special type; they break not only a particular symmetry of translation but
also, in the QCs' jargon, the 'class of local isomorphism' of the QC. In fact,
such dipoles, if they open up into loops, bound stacking faults; a phason
singularity is thus an imperfect dislocation. It is suggested that the
interplay of perfect and imperfect dislocations is at the origin of the
peculiar characters of the plastic deformation of QCs, namely the
brittle-ductile transition followed by a stage of work softening; in particular
the brittle-ductile transition could be related to a cooperative transition of
the Kosterlitz-Thouless type which affects the dipoles and turn them into
(imperfect) dislocation loops.

with average magnetization m=-1. However the magnetization relaxes into this
final value extremely slowly in an inverse logarithmic fashion. We further map
this spin model exactly onto a simple lattice model of granular compaction that
includes the minimal microscopic moves needed for compaction. This toy model
then predicts analytically an inverse logarithmic law for the growth of density
of granular particles, as seen in recent experiments and thereby provides a new
mechanism for the inverse logarithmic relaxation. Our analysis utilizes an
independent interval approximation for the particle and the hole clusters and
is argued to be exact at late times (supported also by numerical simulations).

states in a leaky optical cavity with pairs of degenerate cavity modes close to
the non-degenerate exciton transition frequencies. An open quantum system
approach is used to compute the polarisation entanglement of the two-photon
state after it escapes from the cavity, measured by the visibility of
two-photon interference fringes. We explicitly relate the two-photon visibility
to the degree of Bell-inequality violation, deriving a threshold at which
Bell-inequality violations will be observed. Our results show that an ideal

system of two electrons confined to a pair of coupled quantum dots by using an
effective two-site model of Hubbard-type. Numerically integrating the
Schroedinger equation in time reveals that for certain values of the strength
and frequency of the field the tunneling between the dots can be destroyed,
thus allowing the correlated two-electron states to be manipulated. We then
show how Floquet theory can be used to predict the field parameters at which
this effect occurs. We then consider the case of confining the electrons to a
single two-dimensional quantum dot in the limit of low particle-density. In
this system the electrons form strongly correlated states termed Wigner
molecules, in which the Coulomb interaction causes them to become highly
localised in space. Again using an effective model of Hubbard-type, we
investigate how the AC field can drive the dynamics of the Wigner states. As
before, we find that the AC field can be used to control the tunneling between
various charge configurations, and we relate this to the presence of avoided
crossings in the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum. These results hold out the
exciting possibility of using AC fields to control the time evolution of
entangled states in mesoscopic devices, which has great relevance to the
rapidly advancing field of quantum information processing.

correlation function, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the ratio of output
over input SNR, i.e. the gain, which is associated to the nonlinear response of
a bistable system driven by time-periodic forces and white Gaussian noise.
These quantifiers for SR are evaluated using the techniques of Linear Response
Theory (LRT) beyond the usually employed two-mode approximation scheme. We
analytically demonstrate within such an extended LRT description that the gain
can indeed not exceed unity. We implement an efficient algorithm, based on work
by Greenside and Helfand (detailed in the Appendix), to integrate the driven
Langevin equation over a wide range of parameter values. The predictions of LRT
are carefully tested against the results obtained from numerical solutions of
the corresponding Langevin equation over a wide range of parameter values. We
further present an accurate procedure to evaluate the distinct contributions of
the coherent and incoherent parts of the correlation function to the SNR and
the gain. As a main result we show for subthreshold driving that both, the
correlation function and the SNR can deviate substantially from the predictions
of LRT and yet, the gain can be either larger or smaller than unity. In
particular, we find that the gain can exceed unity in the strongly nonlinear
regime which is characterized by weak noise and very slow multifrequency
subthreshold input signals with a small duty cycle. This latter result is in
agreement with recent analogue simulation results by Gingl et al. in Refs. [18,

for small doping is a d-wave superconductor. A conventional superconductor has
collective modes associated with the amplitude and phase of the pairing order
parameter. Here, the hopping matrix element $\chi_{ij}$ is also a mean field
order parameter. We therefore expect that new collective modes will be
introduced with these additional complex degrees of freedom. We compute the new
collective modes and their spectral functions by numerically diagonalizing the
matrix which describes the fluctuations about the mean field solution. We also
show that the SU(2) gauge theory formulation allows us to predict and classify
these collective modes. Indeed, the SU(2) formulation is essential in order to
avoid spurious collective modes as the doping $x$ goes to zero. The most
important new collective modes are the $\theta$ mode and the longitudinal and
transverse $\phi$ gauge modes. The $\theta$ mode corresponds to fluctuations of
the staggered flux phase and creates orbital current fluctuations. The $\phi$
gauge modes correspond to out-of-phase fluctuations of the {\em amplitudes} of
the pairing and the hopping matrix elements. We compute the neutron scattering
cross-section which couples to the $\theta$ mode and inelastic X-ray scattering
cross-section which couples to the fluctuation in the real part of $\chi_{ij}$.
In addition, we show that the latter fluctuation at $(\pi,\pi)$ may be coupled
to the buckling phonon mode in the LTO phase of LSCO and may be detected
optically. Experimental searches of these collective modes will serve as
important tests of this line of attack on the high T$_c$ problem.

presented. AdS_2 D-branes are algebraically defined by twisted Dirichlet
boundary conditions and are located on twisted conjugacy classes of SL(2,R).
Using free field representation of symmetry currents in the SL(2,R) WZNW model,
the twisted Dirichlet gluing conditions among currents are translated to
matching conditions among free fields and then to boundary conditions among the
modes of free fields. The Ishibashi states are written as coherent states on
AdS_3 in the free field formalism and it is shown that twisted Dirichlet
boundary conditions are satisfied on them. The tree-level amplitude of
propagation of closed strings between two AdS_2 D-branes is evaluated and by
comparing which to the characters of sl(2,R) Kac-Moody algebra it is shown that
only states in the principal continuous series representation of sl(2,R)
Kac-Moody algebra contributes to the amplitude and thus they are the only ones
that couple to AdS_2 D-branes. The form of the character of sl(2,R) principal
continuous series and the boundary condition among the zero modes are used to
determine the physical boundary states for AdS_2 D-branes.

moment. Although it was conjectured shortly after the discovery of parity
nonconservation, its existence has not been confirmed until recently in heavy
nuclear systems, which are known to be the suitable laboratories because of the
many-body enhancement. By carefully identifying the nuclear-spin-dependent
atomic parity nonconserving effect, the first clear evidence was found in
cesium. In this talk, I will discuss how nuclear anapole moments are used to
constrain the parity-nonconserving nuclear force, a still less well-known
channel among weak interactions.

subjected to high intensity hadron and electromagnetic irradiation. It focuses
on improvements for the foreseen LHC applications, employing oxygenation of
silicon wafers during detector processing (result from CERN-RD48). An updated
survey on hadron induced damage is given in the first article. Several
improvements are outlined especially with respect to antiannealing problems
associated with detector storage during LHC maintenance periods. Open questions
are outlined in the final section, among which are a full understanding of
differences found between proton and neutron induced damage, process related
effects changing the radiation tolerance in addition to the oxygen content and
the lack of understanding the changed detector properties on the basis of
damage induced point and cluster defects. In addition to float zone silicon, so
far entirely used for detector fabrication,Czochralski silicon was also studied
and first promising results are shown. The other three papers deal with gamma
induced damage including also defects introduced either by processing steps or
being inherent to the as grown silicon. However the focus is on measurements
after gamma irradiation in a wide dose range. Both the changes in detector
properties and defect characterisations have been studied. For the first time
it is shown that in contrast to a standard process oxygenated silicon detectors
withstand an irradiation dose of up to 1 Grad with only minor deterioration.
Also it is shown for the first time that in this case the detector properties
can directly be explained by the damage induced point defects. This 1:1
correlation is extremely promising for all future defect engineering work.

for a precise characterization of the joint statistical properties of velocity
increment and energy dissipation. In particular, it is possible to determine
the differential equation that governs the evolution along scales of the joint
probability density of these two quantities. The properties of this equation
provide interesting new insights into the coupling between energy dissipation

  approach","Revtex, 9 pages, 3 EPS figures. To be published in PRA",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.66.062712",,"quant-ph",,"  Recently, general point interactions in one dimension has been used to model
a large number of different phenomena in quantum mechanics. Such potentials,
however, requires some sort of regularization to lead to meaningful results.
The usual ways to do so rely on technicalities which may hide important
physical aspects of the problem. In this work we present a new method to
calculate the exact Green functions for general point interactions in 1D. Our
approach differs from previous ones because it is based only on physical
quantities, namely, the scattering coefficients, $R$ and $T$, to construct $G$.
Renormalization or particular mathematical prescriptions are not invoked. The
simple formulation of the method makes it easy to extend to more general
contexts, such as for lattices of $N$ general point interactions; on a line; on
a half-line; under periodic boundary conditions; and confined in a box.

that taking pr_0\|sin(\theta/2)|/\hbar<<1 in our expression of the differential
cross section it reduces to the one reported by AB, and if additionally we
assume \theta << 1 our result becomes the one obtained by LL. However, these
limits are explicitly singular in \hbar as opposed to our initial result. We
analyze the singular behavior in \hbar and show that the perturbative Planck's
limit (\hbar -> 0) is consistent, contrarily to those of the AB and LL
expressions. We also discuss the scattering in a uniform and constant magnetic
field, which resembles some features of QCD.
