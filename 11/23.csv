provide the most accurate determinations of stellar mass, radius, temperature
and distance-independent luminosity for each of their individual components,
and hence constitute a stringent test of single-star stellar evolution theory.
We compile a large sample of 60 non interacting, well-detached systems mostly
with typical errors smaller than 2% for mass and radius and smaller than 5% for
effective temperature, and compare them with the properties predicted by
stellar evolutionary tracks from a minimization method. To assess the
systematic errors introduced by a given set of tracks, we compare the results
obtained using three widely-used independent sets of tracks, computed with
different physical ingredients (the Geneva, Padova and Granada models). We also
test the hypothesis that the components of these systems are coeval and have
the same metallicity, and compare the derived ages and metallicities with the
ones obtained by fitting a single isochrone to the system. Overall, there is a
good agreement among the different determinations, and we provide a
comprehensive discussion on the sub-sample of systems which either present
problems or have estimated metallicities. Although within the errors the
published tracks can fit most of the systems, a large degeneracy between age
and metallicity remains. The power of the test is thus limited because the
metallicities of most of the systems are unknown.

  June 2002, Eds. N. Sanchez and H. de Vega, in press""",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In this short review we describe some of the latest endeavours to understand
the activity around Black Holes. First, it has been possible to demonstrate
that a large part of the electromagnetic emission observed can be interpreted
as arising from the jet; this explains at once all spectral features and their
variability. Second we dwell on the concept that merging galaxies naturally
lead to merging Black Holes. Here we emphasize two aspects: a) the torque
exerted by the binary Black Holes carves a torus like distribution out of the
stellar population near to the Black Hole binary; b) We consider the last
stages of the Black Hole binary merger, taking into account the angle between
the spin of the primary Black Hole, and the orbital spin of the second Black
Hole. We show that the loss of orbital angular momentum is very strongly
spin-dependent; for large angles between the two spins the angular momentum
loss is strongly inhibited, allowing spin flip of the primary Black Hole which
preserves a high angular momentum relative to the maximum allowed. This ensures
that both before and after the merger the accretion disk may reach to very
small distances from the central Black Hole, with very high local temperatures
right near the base of the jet: This is especially interesting in the case that
forming the jet requires the formation of an ADAF like ring near the inner edge
of the disk, as suggested by some earlier work. It also may have consequences
for the initial hadronic interactions right near the base of the jet. Finally,
this may also have important implications for the discovery of gravitational
radiation bursts from the merger of black holes; the spin dependence needs to
be taken into account.

extremely narrow linewidths in the central regions of the cloud. These narrow
lines are consistent with thermally broadened profiles for the measured gas
temperature of 10.5 K. We determine the thermal pressure to be a factor 4 -- 5

supported cloud drawn previously from deep infrared extinction measurements.
The rotational kinetic energy is found to be only a few percent of the
gravitational potential energy, indicating that the contribution of rotation to
the overall stability of the cloud is insignificant. Finally, our observations
show that CS line is optically thick and self-reversed across nearly the entire

asymmetric and are found to vary across the cloud in such a manner that the
presence of both inward and outward motions are observed within the cloud.
Moreover, these motions appear to be globally organized in a clear and

significantly improve the already unprecedented spatial resolution of Chandra
X-ray imaging with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS). Chandra CCD
SER techniques are based on the premise that the impact position of events can
be refined, based on the distribution of charge among affected CCD pixels. ACIS
SER models proposed thus far are restricted to corner split (3- and 4-pixel)
events, and assume that such events take place at the split pixel corners. To
improve the event counting statistics, we modified the ACIS SER algorithms to
include 2-pixel split events and single pixel events, using refined estimates
for photon impact locations. Furthermore, simulations that make use of a
high-fidelity backside illuminated (BI) CCD model demonstrate that mean photon
impact positions for split events are energy dependent leading to further
modification of subpixel event locations according to event type and energy,
for BI ACIS devices. Testing on Chandra CCD X-ray observations of the Orion
Nebula Cluster indicates that these modified SER algorithms further improve the
spatial resolution of Chandra/ACIS, to the extent that the spreading in the
spatial distribution of photons is dominated by the High Resolution Mirror
Assembly, rather than by ACIS pixelization.

core of 3C 303. Despite the limited signal-to-noise ratio of the short Chandra
exposure, the X-ray photon spectrum was measured for the hotspot. We construct
the spectral energy distribution (SED) and find that the X-ray flux is well
below the extrapolation of the radio-to-optical continuum, which we interpret
as resulting from the production of X-rays via inverse Compton scattering of
both synchrotron photons (SSC) and cosmic microwave background photons
(EC/CMB). The magnetic field strength, region size, and the maximum energy of
electrons are self-consistently determined for the hotspot to be B ~ 4.3 \mu G,
R ~ 6.5x10^{21} cm, and G_max ~ 1.4x10^7. This implies a magnetic field
strength a factor of ~30 below the equipartition value; B_eq ~ 150 \mu G. The
origin of this large departure from equipartition is still uncertain, but the
discrepancy is reduced if the plasma in the hotspot is moving with mildly
relativistic speeds. Our observation of 3C 303, as well as recent Chandra
detections of large scale jets and hotspots in a number of radio galaxies,
confirm that particles are accelerated very efficiently in radio galaxies.

observations, the source was found to exhibit such state transition only on 16
occasions. An examination of the RXTE/ASM data in conjunction with the pointed
observations reveals that these events appeared as a series of quasi-regular
dips in two stretches of long duration (about 20 days during each occasions)
when hard X-ray and radio flux were very low. The X-ray light curve and
color-color diagram of the source during these observations are found to be
different from any reported so far. The duration of these dips is found to be
of the order of a few tens of seconds with a repetition time of a few hundred
seconds. The transition between these dips and non-dips which differ in
intensity by a factor of ~ 3.5, is observed to be very fast (~ a few seconds).
It is observed that the low-frequency narrow QPOs are absent in the power
density spectrum (PDS) of the dip and non-dip regions of class $\omega$ and the
PDS is a power law in 0.1 - 10 Hz frequency range. There is a remarkable
similarity in the spectral and timing properties of the source during the dip

source are distinctly different from those seen in the observations of other
classes. This indicates that the basic accretion disk structure during both dip
and non-dip regions of class $\omega$ is similar, but differ only in intensity.
To explain these observations, we invoke a model in which the viscosity is very
close to critical viscosity and the shock wave is weak or absent.

dielectric tensor and the second-harmonic-generation susceptibility. The effect
of lattice relaxations on the linear optical properties are studied. Our
calculations show that the major anisotropy in the optical properties is the
result of strain in GaP. This anisotropy is maximum for the superlattice with
maximum lattice mismatch between the constituent materials. In order to
differentiate the superlattice features from the bulk-like transitions an
improvement over the existing effective medium model is proposed. The
superlattice features are found to be more pronounced for the second-order than
the linear optical response indicating the need for full supercell calculations
in determining the correct second-order response.

the density-of-states in a metallic nanotube above the energy gap. Increased

that these ``spiky templates'' are good candidates for a family of precession

Color Glass Condensate model can be related to Deep Inelastic Scattering of
leptons on protons/nuclei (DIS). The common building block is the quark
antiquark (or gluon-gluon) dipole cross section which is present in both DIS
and pA processes. This correspondence in a sense generalizes the standard
leading twist approach to pA collisions based on collinear factorization and
perturbative QCD, and allows one to express the pA cross sections in terms of a
universal quantity (dipole cross section) which, in principle, can be measured
in DIS or other processes. Therefore, using the parameterization of dipole
cross section at HERA, one can calculate particle production cross sections in
proton-nucleus collisions at high energies. Alternatively, one could use
proton-nucleus experiments to further constrain models of the dipole
cross-section. We show that the McLerran-Venugopalan model predicts enhancement
of cross sections at large p_t (Cronin effect) and suppression of cross
sections at low p_t. The cross over depends on rapidity and moves to higher p_t
as one goes to more forward rapidities.

almost everywhere convergence of Fourier series. This paper is a generalization
of their techniques (known broadly as time-frequency analysis) to higher
dimensions. In particular, a weak-type (2,2) estimate is derived for a maximal
dyadic sum operator on R^n, n > 1. As an application one obtains a new proof of
Sj\""olin's theorem on weak L^2 estimates for the maximal conjugated
Calder\'on-Zygmund operator on R^n.

  Goodman-Pollack Festscrift, (B. Aronov, S. Basu, J. Pach and M. Sharir,

lower bounds for the minimal number of triangles t needed to form a
triangulated PL surface in R^d having P as its geometric boundary. The most
interesting case is dimension 3, where the polygon may be knotted. We use the
Seifert suface construction to show there always exists an embedded surface
requiring at most 7n^2 triangles. We complement this result by showing there
are polygons in R^3 for which any embedded surface requires at least 1/2n^2 -
O(n) triangles. In dimension 2 only n-2 triangles are needed, and in dimensions
5 or more there exists an embedded surface requiring at most n triangles. In
dimension 4 we obtain a partial answer, with an O(n^2) upper bound for embedded
surfaces, and a construction of an immersed disk requiring at most 3n
triangles. These results can be interpreted as giving qualitiative discrete
analogues of the isoperimetric inequality for piecewise linear manifolds.

spatiotemporal system is investigated in the context of coupled map lattice
models. Specifically, a locally coupled map lattice subjected to an external
drive is compared to a coupled map system with similar local couplings plus a
global interaction. It is shown that, under some conditions, the emergent
patterns in both systems are analogous. Based on the knowledge of the dynamical
responses of the driven lattice, we present a method that allows the prediction
of parameter values for the emergence of ordered spatiotemporal patterns in a
class of coupled map systems having local coupling and general forms of global
interactions.

due to the presence of the multi-electron cloud that surrounds the target
nuclei. As a result the relevant astrophysical factors are overestimated unless
corrected appropriately. This study gives both an estimate of the error
committed if screening effects are not taken into account and a rough profile
of the laboratory energy thresholds at which the screening effect appears. The
results indicate that, for most practical purposes, screening corrections to
past relevant experiments can be disregarded. Regarding future experiments,
however, screening corrections to the CNO reactions will certainly be of
importance as they are closely related to the solar neutrino fluxes and the rp
process. Moreover, according to the present results, screening effects will
have to be taken into account particularly by the current and future LUNA
experiments, where screened astrophysical factors will be enhanced to a
significant degree.
