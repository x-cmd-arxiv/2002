supernovae (SNe Ia) segregated according to the type of host galaxy. This makes
it possible to check earlier evidence for a cosmological constant by explicitly
comparing SNe residing in galaxies likely to contain negligible dust with the
larger sample. The cosmological parameters derived from these SNe Ia hosted by
presumed dust-free early-type galaxies supports earlier claims for a
cosmological constant, which we demonstrate at 5 sigma significance, and the
internal extinction implied is small even for late-type systems (A_B<0.2).
Thus, our data demonstrate that host galaxy extinction is unlikely to
systematically dim distant SNe Ia in a manner that would produce a spurious
cosmological constant. We classify the host galaxies of 39 distant SNe
discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project (SCP) using the combination of
HST STIS imaging, Keck ESI spectroscopy and ground-based broad-band photometry.
We compare with a low-redshift sample of 25 SNe Ia. The scatter observed in the
SNe Ia Hubble diagrams correlates closely with host galaxy morphology. We find
the scatter in the SNe Ia Hubble diagram is smallest for SNe occurring in
early-type hosts and largest for those occurring in late-type galaxies.
Moreover, SNe residing in early-type hosts appear only ~0.14+/-0.09 mag
brighter in their light-curve-width-corrected luminosity than those in
late-type hosts, implying only a modest amount of dust extinction even in the
late-type systems.

for the temporal evolution of the size and luminosity of a powerful double
radio source, as well as Lambda-CDM simulations of the cosmic web of baryonic
material at different redshifts, we argue that during the quasar era a high
fraction of the volume of the web was occupied by the lobes of double radio
sources. Widespread compression of protostellar clouds, triggered by the high
pressure of the synchrotron plasma of the radio lobes, can thus be expected to
have played a significant role in the global star formation history of the
universe. These lobes can also yield a rather high level of magnetization of
the intergalactic medium at these early cosmic epochs.

structures found in earlier (1996) VLBA observations of Torrelles and

with the VLBA proper motions and astrometric uncertainties. The radius of
curvature of the R4 structure of maser arcs appears to have grown by a factor
of two, and the displacement of the arcs between 1996 and 2000 are compatible
with expansion about a common center. In addition, the MERLIN observations
detect red-shifted masers not previously found; taken with the newly discovered
masers, the R4 structure now resembles patchy emission from an elliptical ring.
We demonstrate that a simple bow-shock model cannot simultaneously account for
the shape and the velocity gradient of the R4 structure. A model involving a
slow, hydromagnetic shock propagating into a rotating, circumstellar disk
better describes the maser spot kinematics and luminosities. In this model, the
central mass is 3 solar masses, and we demonstrate that the mass of the disk is
negligible in comparison. The expansion velocity of the post-shock gas, roughly
5 km / s, is slow compared to the average shock velocity (roughly 13 km / s)
suggesting that the post-shock gas is magnetically supported with a
characteristic field strength of roughly 30 mG. We speculate that the expanding
maser rings R4 and R5 may be generated by periodic, instability-driven winds
from young stars that periodically send spherical shocks into the surrounding
circumstellar material.

spectroscopy to otherwise determine the system's parameters. We examined a
series of photoionization calculations which were designed to push the nebulae
into the limit where many IR lines should be quite optically thick. We find
that radiative transfer effects do not significantly change the observed
emission line spectrum. This is due to a combination of grain absorption of the
hydrogen ionizing continuum and the fact that the correction for stimulated
emission in these lines is large. Given these results, and the likelihood that
real objects have non-thermal line broadening, it seems unlikely that line
optical depth presents a problem in using these lines as diagnostics of the

dynamically just as an additional component of the dark matter. The second
hypothesis is that the mass distribution characteristic of a newly formed dark

of halos. We also assume that the stellar velocity dispersion does not evolve
much at z<6, because a massive host halo grows mainly by the addition of

the unconfused phase-averaged X-ray spectrum of the 3.05-ms pulsar B1821--24 is
measured and found to be best described by a power law with photon index ~ 1.2.
Marginal evidence of an emission line centered at 3.3 keV in the pulsar
spectrum is found, which could be interpreted as cyclotron emission from a
corona above the pulsar's polar cap if the the magnetic field is strongly
different from a centered dipole. The unabsorbed pulsar flux in the 0.5--8.0

rest-frame UV light of eight of these galaxies demonstrates the well-known
``alignment effect''. Most of the radio galaxies have rounder, more symmetric
morphologies at rest-frame optical wavelengths. Here we show the most direct
evidence that in most cases the stellar hosts are normal elliptical galaxies
with de Vaucouleurs law light profiles. For a few galaxies very faint traces of
the UV-bright aligned component are also visible in the infrared images. We
derive both the effective radius and surface-brightness for nine of eleven
sample galaxies by fitting surface-brightness models to them. We find their
sizes are similar to those of local FRII radio source hosts and are in general
larger than other local galaxies. The derived host galaxy luminosities are very
high and lie at the bright end of luminosity functions constructed at similar
redshifts. The galaxies in our sample are also brighter than the rest-frame
size--surface-brightness locus defined by the low-redshift sources. Passive
evolution roughly aligns the z ~ 1 galaxies with the low-redshift samples. The
optical host is sometimes centered on a local minimum in the rest-frame UV
emission, suggesting the presence of substantial dust obscuration. We also see
good evidence of nuclear point sources in three galaxies. Overall, our results
are consistent with the hypothesis that these galaxies have already formed the
bulk of their stars at redshifts greater than z >~ 2, and that the AGN
phenomenon takes place within otherwise normal, perhaps passively evolving,

field dwarfs, and implies a bias-corrected binary fraction of 9$^{+15}_{-4}$%
for $a \gtrsim 1$ AU and $q \gtrsim 0.4$, significantly lower than the binary
fractions of F--G and early-type M dwarf stars. Neither of the T binaries have
separations $a \gtrsim 10$ AU, consistent with results from other brown dwarf
binary searches. We conclude that tidal disruption by passing stars or Giant
Molecular Clouds, which limits the extent of wide stellar binaries, plays no
role in eliminating wide brown dwarf binaries, implying either disruption very
early in the formation process (ages $\lesssim 1-10$ Myr) or a formation
mechanism which precludes such systems. We find that the maximum binary
separation in the brown dwarf regime appears to scale as M$_{total}^2$, a
possible clue to the physical mechanism which restricts wide substellar
systems.

evolution of multi-mass star clusters in external tidal fields. Our clusters
start with the same initial mass-functions, but varying particle numbers,
orbital types and density profiles. Our main focus is to study how the stellar
mass-function and other cluster parameters change under the combined influence
of stellar evolution, two-body relaxation and the external tidal field. We find
that the lifetimes of star clusters moving on similar orbits scale as T sim
T_RH^x, where T_RH is the relaxation time, and the exponent x depends on the
initial concentration of the cluster and is around x approx 0.75. From the
results for the lifetimes, we predict that between 53% to 67% of all galactic
globular clusters will be destroyed within the next Hubble time. Low-mass stars
are preferentially lost and the depletion is strong enough to turn initially
increasing mass-functions into mass-functions which decrease towards the
low-mass end. The details of this depletion are insensitive to the starting
condition of the cluster. The preferential depletion of low-mass stars from
star clusters leads to a decrease of their mass-to-light ratios except for a
short period close to final dissolution. The fraction of compact remnants is
increasing throughout the evolution and they are more strongly concentrated
towards the cluster cores than main-sequence stars. For a sample of galactic
globular clusters with well observed parameters, we find a correlation between
the observed slope of the mass-function and the lifetimes predicted by us. It
seems possible that galactic globular clusters started with a mass-function
similar to what one observes for the average mass-function of the galactic disc
and bulge. (Abridged)

masers are found in thick expanding shells with inner radii ~ 6 to 16 au and

through the H2O maser regions, with logarithmic velocity gradients of 0.5--0.9.
IK Tau and RT Vir have well-filled H2O maser shells with a spatial offset
between the near and far sides of the shell, which suggests that the masers are
distributed in oblate spheroids inclined to the line of sight. U Ori and U Her
have elongated poorly-filled shells with indications that the masers at the

are density bounded. Masing clouds can be identified over a similar timescale
to their sound crossing time (~2 yr) but not longer. The sizes and observed
lifetimes of these clouds are an order of magnitude smaller than those around

sample of cluster galaxies whose internal structure in UV, optical (OPT) and
NIR (U-, V- and H-band restframe) can be investigated up to a look-back time of
~6 Gyr (Omega_m=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7 and H_0=70 Km/s/Mpc). Galaxies are
classified as spheroids or disks according to the shape of the light profile,
and the evolution of the two populations are investigated separately. On
average, both spheroids and disks are more concentrated at longer wavelengths:
the galaxy sizes become smaller from UV to NIR, while Sersic indices increase.
This trend shows an evolution in disks, where the mean ratio of optical to NIR
Sersic indices decreases from z=0.31 to z=0.64. Colour gradients are on average
negative at all redshifts and are stronger in disks than in spheroids.
  Colour gradients and central colours are compared with models of metallicity,
age, and dust extinction gradients. Metallicity turns out to be the primary
driver of colour gradients in spheroids, the age gradient being constrained to
be smaller than ~25%. For disks, two kinds of models fit the present data: (i)
age gradients (in the range [30,50]%) with significant dust extinction, and
(ii) `pure' dust models, in which the gradients of colour excess are a factor
of two higher in EIS 0048 than in the other clusters. Since colour gradients of
disks seem not to correlate significantly with inclination, we argue that age
gradient models could represent a more likely explanation of the present data,
in agreement with what expected on the basis of hierarchical merging scenarios.

distributions and shows that entropy and energy can be defined in such a way
that these probability distributions are the equilibrium states of a
generalized thermostatistics. This generalized thermostatistics is obtained
from the standard formalism by deformation of exponential and logarithmic
functions. Since this procedure is non-unique, specific choices are motivated
by showing that the resulting theory is well-behaved. In particular, the
equilibrium state of any system with a finite number of degrees of freedom is,
automatically, thermodynamically stable and satisfies the variational
principle. The equilibrium probability distribution of open systems deviates
generically from the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. If the interaction with the
environment is not too strong then one can expect that a slight deformation of
the exponential function, appearing in the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, can
reproduce the observed temperature dependence. An example of a system, where
this statement holds, is a single spin of the Ising chain. The connection
between the present formalism and Tsallis' thermostatistics is discussed. In
particular, the present generalization sheds some light onto the historical
development of the latter formalism.

considered within the Caldeira-Leggett formulation, which describes the system

usual direct approach of discretizing the path integral could seem feasible,
but complications arise when one tries to introduce a physically meaningful
dissipation kernel: in particular its imaginary-time dependence turns out to be
severely singular and difficult to evaluate analytically, in spite of the
simple expressions for its Matsubara components. We therefore propose to face
the numerical problem using Fourier path-integral Monte Carlo, that can be
formulated in two different ways: transforming the continuous paths and then
truncating the high Fourier components (with possible improvements upon the
truncation procedure), or performing the Fourier transformation upon the
discretized paths. The latter choice leads to a simpler formulation and allows
for a better control of the extrapolation to the limit of infinite Trotter
number. The method is implemented for a single nonlinear particle with Ohmic
dissipation and for a phi^4 chain with Drude-like dissipation.

dependence of the mean density $P(t)$ of persistent spins is imposed. For this

study the spatial structure of the persistent region within the MMFA. We show

asymptotic scaling form $n(k,t)=t^{-2\phi}g(t,\frac{k}{t^{\phi}})$ where the
dynamical exponent has the form $\phi$=max(${1/2},\theta$). The behaviour of
the scaling function for large and small values of the arguments is found
analytically. We find that for small separations $k\ll t^{\phi}, n(k,t)\sim
P(t)k^{-\tau}$ where $\tau$=max($2(1-\theta),2\theta$), while for large

f-electron hopping, Coulomb interaction, and crystalline electric field (CEF)
terms. In order to clarify the meaning of one f-electron state, here the j-j
coupling scheme is considered, since the spin-orbit interaction is generally
large in f-electron systems. Thus, the f-electron state at each site is
labelled by $\mu$, namely, the z-component of total angular momentum j. By
paying due attention to f-orbital symmetry, the hopping amplitudes between
f-electron states are expressed using Slater's integrals. The Coulomb
interaction terms among the $\mu$-states are written by Slater-Condon or Racah
parameters. Finally, the CEF terms are obtained from the table of Hutchings.
The constructed Hamiltonian is regarded as an orbital degenerate Hubbard model,
since it includes two pseudo-spin and three pseudo-orbital degrees of freedom.
For practical purposes, it is further simplified into a couple of two-orbital
models by discarding one of the three orbitals. One of those simplified models
is here analyzed using the exact diagonalization method to clarify ground-state
properties by evaluating several kinds of correlation functions. Especially,
the superconducting pair correlation function in orbital degenerate systems is
carefully calculated based on the concept of off-diagonal long-range order. We

to account for the small size of the system, i.e., for the fact that the
trapping frequency hbar omega is of the same order of magnitude as the gap
Delta. It is shown that the usual transport approach, corresponding to the
leading order of an expansion in powers of hbar, is not accurate in this case.
It turns out that Theta does not change rapidly if T becomes smaller than T_c,
but it rather decreases slowly. Qualitatively this behavior can be explained
within the two-fluid model, which again corresponds to the leading order in
hbar. Quantitatively we find deviations from the two-fluid model due to the
small system size.

perturbation theory where the prediction for the Higgs boson mass depends on
the magnitude of the ultraviolet cutoff $\Lambda$. This approach crucially
assumes that the vacuum field and its quantum fluctuations rescale in the same
way. The results of the present lattice simulation, confirming previous
numerical indications, show that this assumption is not true. As a consequence,
large values of the Higgs mass $m_H$ can coexist with the limit $\Lambda\to
\infty $. As an example, by extrapolating to the Standard Model our results
obtained in the Ising limit of the one-component theory, one can obtain a value
as large as $m_H=760 \pm 21$ GeV, independently of $\Lambda$.

semigroup $(e^{-tH^\Gamma})_{t\in\R_+}$ was introduced and studied in [{\it J.

intensity $m$--the volume measure on $X$. We construct a metric space
$\Gamma_\infty$ that is continuously embedded into $\Gamma_X$. Under some
conditions on the manifold $X$ and we prove that $\Gamma_\infty$ is a set of
full $\pi_m$ measure. The central results of the paper are two types of Feller
properties for the heat semigroup. Next, we give a direct construction of the
independent infinite particle process on the manifold $X$, which is a
realization of the Brownian motion on the configuration space. The main point
here is that we prove that this process can start in every
$\gamma\in\Gamma_\infty$, will never leave $\Gamma_\infty$, and has continuous
sample path in $\Gamma_\infty$, provided $\operatorname{dim}X\ge2$. In this
case, we also prove that this process is a strong Markov process whose
transition probabilities are given by the $\P_{t,\gamma}(\cdot)$ above.
Furthermore, we discuss the necessary changes to be done for constructing the
process in the case $\operatorname{dim}X=1$. Finally, as an easy consequence we
get a ``path-wise'' construction of the independent particle process on

advection-diffusion operator, in which most of the scalar variance is
concentrated at small scales, even though a large-scale mode sets the decay
rate. The duration of the superexponential phase is proportional to the

range of persistent external stimuli. In many cases, the bacterial activity
returns to its pre-stimulus level exactly and this ""perfect adaptability"" is
robust against variations in various chemotaxis protein concentrations. We
model the bacterial chemotaxis signaling pathway, from ligand binding to CheY
phosphorylation. By solving the steady-state equations of the model
analytically, we derive a full set of conditions for the system to achieve
perfect adaptation. The conditions related to the phosphorylation part of the
pathway are discovered for the first time, while other conditions are
generalization of the ones found in previous works. Sensitivity of the perfect
adaptation is evaluated by perturbing these conditions. We find that, even in
the absence of some of the perfect adaptation conditions, adaptation can be
achieved with near perfect precision as a result of the separation of scales in
both chemotaxis protein concentrations and reaction rates, or specific
properties of the receptor distribution in different methylation states. Since
near perfect adaptation can be found in much larger regions of the parameter
space than that defined by the perfect adaptation conditions, their existence
is essential to understand robustness in bacterial chemotaxis.

  Vol. 32, No. 7/8, pp. 945-975 (2003)",,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Necessary and sufficient conditions allowing a previously unknown space to be
explored through scanning operators are reexamined with respect to measure
theory. Generalized conceptions of distances and dimensionality evaluation are
proposed, together with their conditions of validity and range of application
to topological spaces. The existence of a Boolean lattice with fractal
properties originating from nonwellfounded properties of the empty set is
demonstrated. This lattice provides a substrate with both discrete and
continuous properties, from which existence of physical universes can be
proved, up to the function of conscious perception. Spacetime emerges as an
ordered sequence of mappings of closed 3-D Ponicare sections of a topological
4-space provided by the lattice. The possibility of existence of spaces with
fuzzy dimension or with adjoined parts with decreasing dimensions is raised,
together with possible tools for their study. The work provides the
introductory foundations supporting a new theory of space whose physical
predictions (suppressing the opposition of quantum and relativistic approaches)
and experimental proofs are presented in details in Parts 2 and 3 of the study.

""faithfulness"", and we say that a state is faithful when acting with a channel

to sets of states, when the output states patched together carry a complete

from N three-level atoms in a high-finesse optical cavity. The method applies
an external laser pulsethat generates an $N$-photon output state while
adiabatically keeping the atom-cavity system within a subspace of optically
dark states. We present analytical estimates of the error due to amplitude
leakage from these dark states for general N, and compare it with explicit
results of numerical simulations for N \leq 5. The method is shown to provide a
robust source of N-photon states under a variety of experimental conditions and
is suitable for experimental implementation using a cloud of cold atoms
magnetically trapped in a cavity. The resulting N-photon states have potential
applications in fundamental studies of non-classical states and in quantum
information processing.

A relationship between entanglement-assisted and one-shot unassisted capacities

is upper bounded by the sum of $\log d$ and the one-shot unassisted classical
capacity.

normalization of the state. Unlike Gleason's theorem, the argument applies even
if probabilities are defined for only a single resolution of the identity, so
it applies to all the major foundational approaches to quantum mechanics. There
are important points of contact with Deutsch's program for deducing the
probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics from decision thoery, as
recently completed by Wallace. Decision theory can be used to supplement the
present derivation, in application to the Everett interpretation, but it is
otherwise unnecessary.
