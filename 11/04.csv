fluctuations in the microwave background radiation (MBR) generated in the
quasi-steady state cosmology (QSSC). The paper begins with a brief description
of how the background is produced and thermalized in the QSSC. We then discuss
within the framework of a simple model, the likely sources of fluctuations in
the background due to astrophysical and cosmological causes. Power spectrum
peaks at $l \approx 6-10$, 180-220 and 600-900 are shown to be related in this
cosmology respectively to curvature effects at the last minimum of the scale
factor, clusters and groups of galaxies. The effect of clusters is shown to be
related to their distribution in space as indicated by a toy model of structure
formation in the QSSC. We derive and parameterize the angular power spectrum
using six parameters related to the sources of temperature fluctuations at
three characteristic scales. We are able to obtain a satisfactory fit to the
observational band power estimates of MBR temperature fluctuation spectrum.
Moreover, the values of `best fit' parameters are consistent with the range of
expected values.

comparing the photometry of each GC with theoretical stellar population
synthesis models, we estimate ages of the sample GCs for different
metallicities. The results show that nearly all our sample GCs have ages more
than 10^{9} years, and most of them are around 10^{10} years old. Also, we find
that GCs fitted by the metal-poor model are generally older than ones fitted by

typically more than 20 times higher than in the 1997 and 2000 low states.
Therefore, the physical process or region that produces the flickering was also
primarily responsible for the large optical flux increase in the 1998 high
state. Assuming that the rapid, stochastic optical variations in CH Cygni come
from the accretion disk, as in cataclysmic variable stars, a change in the
accretion rate through the disk led to the 1998 bright state. All flickering
disappeared in 1999, when the accreting WD was eclipsed by the red giant
orbiting with a period of approximately 14 yr, according to the ephemeris of
Hinkle et al. and the interpretation of Eyres et al. We did not find any
evidence for periodic or quasi-periodic oscillations in the optical emission
from CH Cygni in either the high or low state, and we discuss the implications
for magnetic propeller models of this system. As one alternative to propeller
models, we propose that the activity in CH Cygni is driven by accretion through
a disk with a thermal-viscous instability, similar to the instabilities

sources (Feigelson et al. 2002), providing a uniquely large and well-defined
sample to study the dependence of magnetic activity on bulk properties for
stars descending the Hayashi tracks. The following results are obtained: (1)
X-ray luminosities L_t in the 0.5-8 keV band are strongly correlated with
bolometric luminosity with <log L_t/L_bol> = -3.8 for stars with masses 0.7<M<2
Mo, an order of magnitude below the main sequence saturation level; (2) the
X-ray emission drops rapidly below this level in some or all stars with 2<M<3
Mo; (3) the presence or absence of infrared circumstellar disks has no apparent
relation to X-ray levels; and (4) X-ray luminosities exhibit a slight rise as
rotational periods increase from 0.4 to 20 days. This last finding stands in
dramatic contrast to the strong anticorrelation between X-rays and period seen
in main sequence stars.
  The absence of a strong X-ray/rotation relationship in PMS stars, and
particularly the high X-ray values seen in some very slowly rotating stars, is
a clear indication that the mechanisms of magnetic field generation differ from
those operating in main sequence stars. The most promising possibility is a
turbulent dynamo distributed throughout the deep convection zone, but other
models such as alpha-Omega dynamo with `supersaturation' or relic core fields
are not immediately excluded. The drop in magnetic activity in
intermediate-mass stars may reflect the presence of a significant radiative
core. The evidence does not support X-ray production in large-scale star-disk
magnetic fields.

detected during the course of the Keck Pilot Program. Radial velocities of this
star were obtained during four different observing runs over a time span of 1.1
years, and demonstrate that it is clearly a short period spectroscopic binary.
An orbital solution was obtained, and orbital parameters were determined with
high precision. The rotational velocity was also measured (vsin i=9.7$\pm$1.5
kms); rotation appears likely to be synchronous with the orbit. The abundance
analysis and spectral syntheses indicate that the object is a CH star
characterized by extreme s-process enrichment, likely due to mass accretion
from an evolved companion which has now probably become a white dwarf. The lead
(Pb) abundance of HE0024-2523 is very high, the same as that of the recently
discovered lead-rich metal-poor star CS 29526-110, [Pb/Fe]=+3.3. The abundance
ratio of the heavy-s to light-s elements, as characterized by Pb and Ba,
[Pb/Ba]=+1.9, is the highest yet found for any metal-poor star, and is about
0.7 dex higher than that of CS29526-110. On the basis of the measured isotopic
ratio of carbon (12C/13C about 6) we argue that the mass donor must have had an
original mass of at least 3 Msun. The unusually short period of this CH star
suggests that it underwent a past common-envelope phase with its evolved
companion. Our results are compared to the latest available models for AGB
yields and s-process nucleosynthesis. We also discuss the possible connection

our isochrone interpolation and fitting code are explained.
  We address the systematic errors inherent in the process of isochrone
fitting, and investigate the extent to which simple stellar populations can be
recovered from noisy photometric data. We investigate the effects caused by
inaccurate distance estimates, isochrone model variation and photometric
errors. We present results from two studies of approximately coeval stellar
populations, those of the Milky Way Globular Cluster System (MWGCS), and the
Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy.
  In addition, we introduce a new method for estimating distances using
photometry of the tip of the RGB which is significantly more robust than the
standard edge-detection filter.

large amplitude time-dependences of the form that one might associate with
galaxy or halo formation or strong encounters between pairs of galaxies. A
period of time-dependence with a strong, possibly damped, oscillatory component
can give rise to large amounts of transient chaos, and it is argued that
chaotic phase mixing associated with this transient chaos could play a major
role in accounting for the speed and efficiency of violent relaxation. Analysis
of simple toy models involving time-dependent perturbations of an integrable
Plummer potential indicates that this chaos results from a broad, possibly
generic, resonance between the frequencies of the orbits and harmonics thereof
and the frequencies of the time-dependent perturbation. Numerical computations
of orbits in potentials exhibiting damped oscillations suggest that, within a
period of 10 dynamical times t_D or so, one could achieve simultaneously both
`near-complete' chaotic phase mixing and a nearly time-independent, integrable
end state.

As a new generation of kilometer length interferometric detectors are now

key questions for future gravitational-wave astronomy: Are the gravitational
waves from various instabilities detectable? If so, what can these
gravitational-wave signals teach us about neutron star physics? Even though we
may not have clear answers to these questions, recent studies of the dynamical
bar-mode instability and the secular r-mode instability have provided new
insights into many of the difficult issues involved in modelling unstable stars

the initial continuous density field with such small amplitude correlated

main issues related to the effects of discretisation, particularly concerning
the effect of particle induced fluctuations on the statistical properties of

capillary instability is shown to depend on the elasticity modulus $K$, surface
tension $\sigma_0$, and radius $r_0$ of the LC jet, as expressed by the

ARPES data at 100K show that heavily damped quasiparticles (QP) near ($\pi$,0)
suddenly recover long lifetimes at $p_{crit}$, reflecting an abrupt loss of
scattering from AF spin fluctuations. This picture is confirmed by $\mu$SR
zero-field relaxation measurements which indicate the presence of a novel

several aspects. As for problem solving, we provide a formal definition of its
kernel language, function-free disjunctive logic programs (also known as
disjunctive datalog), extended by weak constraints, which are a powerful tool
to express optimization problems. We then illustrate the usage of DLV as a tool
for knowledge representation and reasoning, describing a new declarative
programming methodology which allows one to encode complex problems (up to
$\Delta^P_3$-complete problems) in a declarative fashion. On the foundational
side, we provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the
language of DLV, and by deriving new complexity results we chart a complete
picture of the complexity of this language and important fragments thereof.
  Furthermore, we illustrate the general architecture of the DLV system which
has been influenced by these results. As for applications, we overview
application front-ends which have been developed on top of DLV to solve
specific knowledge representation tasks, and we briefly describe the main
international projects investigating the potential of the system for industrial
exploitation. Finally, we report about thorough experimentation and
benchmarking, which has been carried out to assess the efficiency of the
system. The experimental results confirm the solidity of DLV and highlight its
potential for emerging application areas like knowledge management and

Proton decays with the modes and rates predicted by(B-L)-conserving schemes of

that (B-L) might not be conserved in nature, thus leading to the nucleon decay
into lepton+(X) and to phenomena such as Majorana masses of neutrinos,
neutrinoless double-beta decays, and most spectacularly to the transitions of
neutron to anti-neutron. The energy scale where (B-L) violation takes place
cannot be predicted by theory and therefore has to be explored by experiments.
Different experimental approaches to searching for (B-L)-violating transition
of neutron to antineutron are discussed in this paper. Most powerful search for
neutron to antineutron transitions can be performed in a new reactor-based

transverse space and certain time-dependent branes fall into the same

restore seemingly broken target space symmetries. In particular, we show that

independence polynomial is unimodal, i.e., there exists a coefficient $k$ such
that the part of the sequence of coefficients from the first to $k$-th is
non-decreasing while the second part of coefficients is non-increasing.
  Y. Alavi, P. J. Malde, A. J. Schwenk and P. Erd\""{o}s (1987) asked whether
for trees (or perhaps forests) the independence polynomial is unimodal. J. I.
Brown, K. Dilcher and R. J. Nowakowski (2000) conjectured that it is true for
any well-covered graph (a graph whose all maximal independent sets have the
same size). V. E. Levit and E. Mandrescu (1999) demonstrated that every
well-covered tree can be obtained as a join of a number of well-covered
spiders, where a spider is a tree having at most one vertex of degree at least
three.
  In this paper we show that the independence polynomial of any well-covered
spider is unimodal. In addition, we introduce some graph transformations
respecting independence polynomials. They allow us to reduce several types of
well-covered trees to claw-free graphs, and, consequently, to prove that their
independence polynomials are unimodal.

notion of a generator polynomial just like for cyclic block codes. Similarly a
control polynomial can be introduced by considering the right annihilator
ideal. An algorithmic procedure is developed which produces unique reduced

invariant of a knot K in M, a ZHS^3. Forgetting the knot (by which we mean
setting diagrams with legs to zero) specialises \Theta (M,K) to \lambda (M),
Casson's invariant. This note describes an extension of Casson's surgery
formula for his invariant to \Theta (M,K). To be precise, we describe the
effect on \Theta (M,K) of a surgery on a knot which together with K forms a
boundary link in M. Whilst the presented formula does not characterise \Theta
(M,K), it does allow some insight into the underlying topology.

one-nucleon emission processes is studied in a nonrelativistic model including
correlations and final state interactions. The nuclear current is the sum of a
one-body and of a two-body part. The two-body current includes pion seagull,
pion-in-flight and the isobar current contributions. Numerical results are
presented for the exclusive 16O(e,e'p)15N and 16O(\gamma,p)15N reactions. MEC
effects are in general rather small in (e,e'p), while in (\gamma,p) they are
always large and important to obtain a consistent description of (e,e'p) and
(\gamma,p) data, with the same spectroscopic factors. The calculated (\gamma,p)
cross sections are sensitive to short-range correlations at high values of the
recoil momentum, where MEC effects are larger and overwhelm the contribution of
correlations.

with $\alpha \approx 1.2$ for $k$ less than 50 citations and $\alpha \approx
2.3$ for 50 or more citations. Two models are presented that both represent the
data well, one which generates power laws and one which generates a stretched
exponential. It is not possible to discriminate between these models on the
present empirical basis. A consideration of citation distribution by subfield
shows that the citation patterns of high energy physics form a remarkably
homogeneous network. Further, we utilize the knowledge of the citation
distributions to demonstrate the extreme improbability that the citation
records of selected individuals and institutions have been obtained by a random
draw on the resulting distribution.

coupling are enabled by the FORT potential, for which the center-of-mass motion
is only weakly dependent on the atom's internal state.
