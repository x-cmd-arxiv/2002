observation was performed with the ACIS-I detector onboard Chandra and yielded
data of high spatial and temporal resolution, together with spectral
information. Mars is clearly detected as an almost fully illuminated disk, with
an indication of limb brightening at the sunward side, accompanied by some
fading on the opposite side. The morphology and the X-ray luminosity of ~4 MW
are fully consistent with fluorescent scattering of solar X-rays in the upper
Mars atmosphere. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by a single narrow emission
line, which is most likely caused by O-K_alpha fluorescence. No evidence for
temporal variability is found. This is in agreement with the solar X-ray flux,
which was almost constant during the observation. In addition to the X-ray
fluorescence, there is evidence for an additional source of X-ray emission,
indicated by a faint X-ray halo which can be traced to about three Mars radii,
and by an additional component in the X-ray spectrum of Mars, which has a
similar spectral shape as the halo. Within the available limited statistics,
the spectrum of this component can be characterized by 0.2 keV thermal
bremsstrahlung emission. This is indicative of charge exchange interactions
between highly charged heavy ions in the solar wind and exospheric hydrogen and
oxygen around Mars. Although the observation was performed at the onset of a
global dust storm, no evidence for dust-related X-ray emission was found.

permeated by strong magnetic fields and also has a contribution of pressure
from cosmic rays. These two components of total pressure are probably highly
time dependent, and range probably between 1/10 of the gas pressure up to
equipartition between gas pressure and the sum of the two other components.
Radio galaxies are likely to provide the main source for both magnetic fields
and cosmic rays. In this concept it becomes easy to understand the occasional
mismatch between the total mass inferred from the assumption of hydrostatic
equilibrium derived purely from gas, and the total mass derived from lensing
data. We also suggest that the structure and topology of the magnetic field may
be highly inhomogeneous - at least over a certain range of scales, and may
contain long twisted filaments of strong magnetic fields, as on the Sun. The
analogy with the interstellar medium may be fruitful to explore further, where
we do not know where magnetic fields come from, but suspect that the cosmic
rays derive from supernova explosions. In such an analogy it becomes useful to
refer to ""radio galaxy explosions"" in clusters of galaxies. A full scale
exploration of all the implications, especially of the notion that occasionally
complete equipartition may be reached, is a task for the future.

according to the shape of the light profile in the I-band, as parametrized by
the Sersic index. In both optical and NIR, spheroids define a sharp
colour-magnitude sequence, whose slope and zero points are consistent with a
high formation redshift (z_f > 2). The disk population occupies a different
region in the colour-magnitude diagram, having bluer colours with respect to
the red sequence. Interestingly, we find some level of mixing between the
properties of the two classes: some disks lie on the colour-magnitude sequence
or are redder, while some spheroids turn out to be bluer. The spatial
distribution of cluster galaxies show a clumpy structure, with a main
over-density of radius ~0.5 Mpc, and at least two other clumps distant ~1 Mpc

understand the physical origin of even subtle, observed differences. An
important issue is also the reddening correction. We belive that the measure of
interstellar lines on medium resolution spectra of SNe can be used to derive
lower limits on the interstellar extinction. A few physical parameters of the
progenitor, namely radius, mass, density structure and angular momentum, may
explain most of the diversity of core-collapse events. In addition, if the
ejecta expand into a dense circumstellar medium the ejecta-CSM interaction may
dominate the observed outcome and provide a mean to probe the mass loss history
of the SN progenitor in the last stages of its evolution.

GRB 991208 at frequencies of 1.4, 4.9 and 8.5 GHz, taken between two weeks and
300 days after the burst. The well-sampled radio light curve at 8.5 GHz shows
that the peak flux density peaked about 10 days after the burst and decayed
thereafter as a power-law t^-1.07. This decay rate is more shallow than the
optical afterglow with t^-2.2, which was measured during the first week. These
late-time data are combined with extensive optical, millimeter and centimeter
measurements and fitted to the standard relativistic blast wave model. In
agreement with previous findings, we find that an isotropic explosion in a
constant density or wind-blown medium cannot explain these broadband data
without modifying the assumption of a single power-law slope for the electron
energy distribution. A jet-like expansion provides a reasonable fit to the
data. In this case, the flatter radio light curve compared to the optical may
be due to emission from an underlying host galaxy, or due to the blastwave
making a transition to non-relativistic expansion. The model that best
represents the data is a free-form model in which it is assumed that the
broadband emission originates from a synchrotron spectrum, while the
time-evolution of the break frequencies and peak flux density are solved for
explicitly. Although the decay indices for most of the synchrotron parameters
are similar to the jet model, the evolution of the cooling break is unusually
rapid, and therefore requires some non-standard evolution in the shock.

perfectly aligned to that of A2152. We discuss the detectability of
microlensing events where a single star in the source cluster behind A2152 is
extremely magnified by an intracluster compact object in A2152. We show that a
search with an 8m-class telescope with a wide field of view, such as the
Subaru/Suprime-Cam, can probe intracluster compact objects with a wide mass
range of m_{co} ~ 10^{-5}-10^{10} M_sun, including ranges that have not yet
been constrained by any past observations. We expect that the event rate is
biased for the background cluster than the foreground cluster (A2152), which
would be a unique signature of microlensing, making this experiment
particularly powerful. The sensitivity of this experiment for the mass fraction
of compact objects would be 1-10% in the total dark matter of the cluster,
which is roughly constant against m_{co}, with a reasonable telescope time for
large telescopes (~10 nights). Therefore any compact objects in this mass range
can be detected or rejected as the dominant component of the dark matter. About
10 events are expected if 20% of the cluster mass is in a form of compact
objects with M ~ 1 M_sun, as claimed by the MACHO collaboration for the Milky
Way halo. Other possibly detectable targets include intracluster stars stripped
by galaxy interactions, and hypothetical very massive black holes (M >~ 100
M_sun) produced as remnants of the first generation stars, which might be
responsible for the recently reported excess of the cosmic infrared background
radiation that seems impossible to explain by normal galactic light.

formation set within the paradigm of hierarchical structure formation. In our
model, the hot gas in halos and sub-halos gives rise to CIV absorption, while
the low-ionization state gas is associated with the cold gas in galaxies. The
model matches the distribution of CIV column densities and leads naturally to
kinematic properties that are in good agreement with the data.
  We examine the contribution of both hot and cold gas to sub-damped systems
and suggest that the properties of these systems can be used as an important
test of the model. We expect that sub-DLA systems will generally be composed of
a single gas disk and thus predict that they should have markedly different
kinematics than the damped systems.
  Finally, we find that hot halo gas produces less than one third of Lyman
limit systems at redshift three. We model the contribution of mini-halos (halos
with virial velocities < 35 km/s) to Lyman limit systems and find that they may
contain as much gas as is observed in these systems. However, if we adopt
realistic models of the gas density distribution we find that these systems are
not a significant source of Lyman limit absorption. Instead we suggest that
uncollapsed gas outside of virialized halos is responsible for most of the
Lyman limit systems at high redshift.

slope has been discovered among radio-quiet active galactic nuclei. The
ionization stage of the bulk of the FeKalpha emitting material is not the same
in all active galactic nuclei and is related to the shape of the X-ray
continua. Active galactic nuclei with a steep X-ray spectrum tend to have a
fluorescence FeKalpha line from highly ionized material. In the narrow-line
Seyfert 1 galaxies with steeper X-ray spectrum (Gamma_X > 2.1), the FeKalpha
line originates from highly ionized material. In the Seyfert 1 galaxies and
quasars with flatter X-ray spectrum (Gamma_X < 2.1), bulk of the FeKalpha
emission arises from near neutral or weakly ionized material. The correlation
is an important observational characteristic related to the accretion process
in radio quiet active galactic nuclei and is driven by a fundamental physical
parameter which is likely to be the accretion rate relative to the Eddington
rate.

  Distributions and Optical Opacities","ApJ in press; corrected typo in Fig.2",,"10.1086/346109",,"astro-ph",,"  The interaction of a radiation field with a dusty medium is a relevant issue
in several astrophysical contexts. We use the time-dependent photoionization
code in a dusty medium developed by Perna & Lazzati (2002), to study the
modifications in the dust distribution and the relative optical opacities when
a strong X-ray UV radiation flux propagates into a medium. We find that
silicates are preferentially destroyed with respect to graphite, and the
extinction curve becomes significantly flatter (hence implying less reddening),
with the characteristic bump at lambda 2175 A highly suppressed, due to the
destruction of the small graphite grains. This could explain the observational
lack of such a feature in GRB afterglow and AGN spectra. For a very intense and
highly variable source irradiating a compact and dense region, time variability
in the optical opacity resulting from dust destruction can be observed on a
relatively short timescale. We show that, under these circumstances, monitoring
the time variability of the opacity can yield powerful clues on the properties
of dust in the environment of the source. In particular, it allows to break the
observational degeneracy as to whether a grey extinction is the result of a low
dust-to-gas ratio or of a dust grain distribution that is skewed towards large
grains.

Initial state is an equilibrium model of a torus threaded by weak toroidal

mass accretes to the black hole by losing the angular momentum. We found that
in the innermost plunging region, non-axisymmetric accretion flow creates
bisymmetric spiral magnetic fields and current sheets. Mass accretion along the
spiral channel creates one armed spiral density distribution. Since the
accreting matter carries in magnetic fields which subsequently are stretched
and amplified due to differential rotation, current density increases inside
the channel. Magnetic reconnection taking place in the current sheet produces
slow mode shock waves which propagate away from the reconnection site. Magnetic
energy release in the innermost plunging region can be the origin of X-ray
shots observed in black hole candidates. Numerical simulations reproduced soft
X-ray excess preceding the peak of the shots, X-ray hardening at the peak of

given in published theoretical calculations, the long duration of the plateau

such an abundance of hydrogen requires a later cessation of the wind which is
in disagreement with the sudden fading observed in late November of 2000. The

  appeared in European Symposium on Algorithms, 2002",,,,"cs.DS",,"  We consider the problem of laying out a tree with fixed parent/child
structure in hierarchical memory. The goal is to minimize the expected number
of block transfers performed during a search along a root-to-leaf path, subject
to a given probability distribution on the leaves. This problem was previously
considered by Gil and Itai, who developed optimal but slow algorithms when the
block-transfer size B is known. We present faster but approximate algorithms
for the same problem; the fastest such algorithm runs in linear time and
produces a solution that is within an additive constant of optimal.
  In addition, we show how to extend any approximately optimal algorithm to the
cache-oblivious setting in which the block-transfer size is unknown to the
algorithm. The query performance of the cache-oblivious layout is within a
constant factor of the query performance of the optimal known-block-size
layout. Computing the cache-oblivious layout requires only logarithmically many
calls to the layout algorithm for known block size; in particular, the
cache-oblivious layout can be computed in O(N lg N) time, where N is the number
of nodes.
  Finally, we analyze two greedy strategies, and show that they have a
performance ratio between Omega(lg B / lg lg B) and O(lg B) when compared to
the optimal layout.

out by Cohen and Kaplan. In this model, the lepton asymmetry varies with time.
In particular, we consider the case where it grows with time. The final lepton
asymmetry is determined by the decoupling of the lepton number violating
interaction and can be as large as order unity. On the other hand, if the
decoupling takes place after the electroweak phase transition, a small baryon
asymmetry is obtained from the small lepton asymmetry at that time through
sphaleron effects. We construct a model in which a rolling scalar field is

neutrino energy losses caused by the direct Urca processes on nucleons in the
degenerate baryon matter. By our analysis, in a free nucleon gas under beta
equilibrium, the direct neutron decay is forbidden if the number density of
neutrons exceeds the critical value $n_{n}^{c}=5.9\times 10^{31} cm^{-3}$. In
superdense nuclear matter, $n>n_{0}$, the weak decay of neutrons is possible
only due to strong interactions, caused by an exchange of isovector mesons.
Mean field of isovector mesons in the medium creates a large energy gap between
spectrums of protons and neutrons, which is required by kinematics of beta
decay. Our expression for the neutrino energy losses, obtained in the mean
field approximation, incorporates the effects of nucleon recoil, parity
violation, weak magnetism, and pseudoscalar interaction. For numerical testing
of our formula, we use a self-consistent relativistic model of the
multicomponent baryon matter. The relativistic emissivity of the direct Urca
reactions is found substantially larger than predicted in the non-relativistic
approach. We found that, due to weak magnetism effects, relativistic
emissivities increase by approximately 40-50%.

fermionic zero modes, lead to spontaneous parity violation and an anomalous
contribution to the central charge such that the BPS bound becomes saturated.
On the other hand, Siegel's dimensional reduction shifts this anomaly to the
counter terms in the renormalized current multiplet. The superconformal anomaly
is located in an evanescent counter term, and imposing supersymmetry, this
counter term induces the same anomalous contribution to the central charge.
Next we discuss a new regularization scheme: local mode regularization. The
local energy density computed in this scheme satisfies the BPS equality (it is
equal to the local central charge density). In an appendix we give a very
detailed account of the DHN method to compute soliton masses applied to the

Sidorenko has given an upper bound of $(r-2) / (r-1)$ for the Tur\'an density

bound when $r$ is of the form $2^p + 1$. We show that when $r = 2^p + 1$, any

we show that corresponding constructions do not exist and improve the upper
bound on the Tur\'an density of $C^4_r$ to $(r-2)/(r-1) - c(r)$, where $c(r)$
is a constant depending only on $r$.
  The backbone of our arguments is a strategy of first proving approximate

must lead to a suboptimal configuration. The tools for its realisation draw on
extremal graph theory, linear algebra, the Kruskal-Katona theorem and

avoidable if there exists a partition {A,B} of S such that no element of U is
the product of two distinct elements of A or of two distinct elements of B. For
more than two decades, avoidable sets in the natural numbers (under addition)
have been studied by renowned mathematicians such as Erdos, and a few families
of sets have been shown to be avoidable in that setting. In this paper we
investigate the generalized notion of an avoidable set and determine the
avoidable sets in several families of groups; previous work in this field
considered only the case (S, *) = (N, +).

an elliptic or hyperbolic Monge-Amp\`ere equation in the dimension 4. We study
from this point of view the example of the Stenzel metric on the cotangent

partition of N. The larger the entanglement index of an state, the more
entangled or the less separable is the state in the sense that a larger maximal
violation of Bell's inequality is attainable for this class of state.

011802 (2000)] according to which the electromagnetically induced absorption
(EIA) resonances observed in degenerate two level systems are due to coherence
transfer from the excited to the ground state is experimentally tested in a
Hanle type experiment observing the parametric resonance on the $% D1$ line of
$^{87}$Rb. While EIA occurs in the $F=1\to F^{\prime}=2 $ transition in a cell
containing only $Rb$ vapor, collisions with a buffer gas ($30 torr$ of $Ne$)
cause the sign reversal of this resonance as a consequence of collisional
decoherence of the excited state. A theoretical model in good qualitative
agreement with the experimental results is presented.

process called root binning, that is used to transform the continuous variables
measurements into binary results needed for the tests of quantum mechanics
versus local realistic theories. A physical process in order to produce such
states is also suggested. The use of high-efficiency spacelike separated
homodyne detections with these states and this binning process would result in
a conclusive loophole-free test of quantum mechanics.
