diffuse X-ray emission associated with the lobes has been detected with high

The 0.5--5 keV ACIS spectrum of the diffuse emission is described by a
two-component model, consisting of a soft thermal plasma emission from the host
galaxy halo and a hard non-thermal power-law component. The hard component is
ascribed to the inverse Comptonization of cosmic microwave background photons
by the synchrotron emitting electrons in the lobes, because its spectral energy
index, 0.68+-0.28, is consistent with the radio synchrotron index, 0.78. These
results reveal a significant electron dominance in the lobes. The electrons are
inferred to have a relatively uniform distribution, while the magnetic field is
compressed toward the lobe periphery.

black hole. Evidence for the presence of a massive central object is provided
by water maser emission, which displays a linear pattern in the sky, suggestive
of a rotating disk. The rotating disk hypothesis is further strengthened by the
declining shape of the derived rotation curve. Similar maser emission from NGC
4258 has led to a reliable estimate of the mass of the central black hole,
because in this case the rotation curve is Keplerian. In the case of NGC 1068
the rotation curve traced by the water maser is non-Keplerian. In this paper we
provide an interpretation of the non-Keplerian rotation in NGC 1068 by means of
a self-gravitating accretion disk model. We obtain a good fit to the available
data and derive a black hole mass M_{bh}=(8.0\pm 0.3) 10^6M_{sun}. The
resulting disk mass is comparable to the black hole mass. As an interesting
by-product of our fitting procedure, we are able to estimate the viscosity
parameter, which turns out to be \alpha\approx 10^{-2}, in line with some
theoretical expectations.

example, we provide a working neural network that can distinguish microlensing
lightcurves from other forms of variability, such as eruptive, pulsating,
cataclysmic and eclipsing variable stars. The network has five input neurons, a
hidden layer of five neurons and one output neuron. The five input variables
for the network are extracted by spectral analysis from the lightcurve
datapoints and are optimised for the identification of a single, symmetric,
microlensing bump. The output of the network is the posterior probability of
microlensing. The committee of neural networks successfully passes tests on
noisy data taken by the MACHO collaboration. When used to process 5000
lightcurves on a typical tile towards the bulge, the network cleanly identifies
the single microlensing event. When fed with a sub-sample of 36 lightcurves
identified by the MACHO collaboration as microlensing, the network corroborates
this verdict in the case of 27 events, but classifies the remaining 9 events as
other forms of variability. For some of these discrepant events, it looks as
though there are secondary bumps or the bump is noisy or not properly
contained. Neural networks naturally allow for the possibility of novelty
detection -- that is, new or unexpected phenomena which we may want to follow
up. The advantages of neural networks for microlensing rate calculations, as
well as the future developments of massive variability surveys, are both

the source of ionization is getting dimmer, causing the region of maximum
emission to drift inwards (and thus to regions of higher velocities). In
addition, in the last 3 yrs of observations, the central wavelength of the
double-peaked line has shifted to bluer wavelengths, which may be due to a wind
from the disk. It is the first time that such evolution is observed so clearly,

density that is determined by the physics of the strong interactions between
the particles that constitute the star. The most straightforward method of
determining these properties is by measuring the gravitational redshift of
spectral lines produced in the neutron star photosphere. The equation of state
implies a mass-radius relation, while a measurement of the gravitational
redshift at the surface of a neutron star provides a direct constraint on the
mass-to-radius ratio. Here we report the discovery of signficant absorption
lines in the spectra of 28 bursts of the low-mass X-ray binary EXO 0748-676. We
identify the most signficant features with the Fe XXVI and XXV n=2-3 and O VIII

uncertainties for the respective transitions. For an astrophysically plausible
range of masses (M ~ 1.3-2.0 M_solar), this value is completely consistent with

of Chandra sources in the same field. We found that the location of these
optically brighter Chandra sources in the near-IR color space was bifurcated,
with the color of one branch being consistent with that of E/S0 galaxies at 0
<= z <= 1.5 and the other branch being consistent with that of unreddened
AGN/QSOs at 0 <= z <= 3.5. The six counterparts that we identified seemed to
lie on the E/S0 branch and its extension, suggesting that these X-ray source
hosts are mostly luminous E/S0 galaxies (M_V ~ -20 mag in AB system) at 1 <= z
<= 2.5. On the other hand, some of them can also be explained by AGN/QSOs over
a wide redshift range (0 <= z <= 5) if a range of internal extinction (A_V=0--1
mag) is allowed. However, the later interpretation requires fine-tuning
extinction together with redshift for these objects individually. If they are
indeed AGN/QSOs, the most luminous of them is just barely qualified for being a
QSO. Finally, we point out that neither high-redshift (z > 5) star-forming
galaxies nor irregular galaxies at lower redshift can be a viable explanation
to the nature of these six counterparts.

inside pulsar wind bubbles (PWBs). This is the most natural outcome of
supranova model where initially a supernova explosion takes place, leaving a
supra-massive NS, which loses its rotational energy over a time t_sd and
collapses to a BH, triggering a GRB explosion. We find that the time delay t_sd
between the supernova and GRB events is the most important parameter that
determines the behavior of the system. We consider the afterglow, prompt GRB
and direct emission from the PWB. The observational signatures for different
t_sd are described and joined together into one coherent framework. Constraints
on the model are derived for a spherical PWB, from the lack of detection of the
PWB emission and afterglow observations. For very low values of t_sd<1 hr the
supranova model reduces to the collapsar model; 0.4<t_sd/1yr<1 is required to
produce the iron lines seen in some X-ray afterglows. However, we find that for
a spherical PWB, this implies no detectable radio afterglow, a small jet break
time and non-relativistic transition time, in disagreement with observations
for some of these GRBs. These discrepancies with the observations may be
reconciled by resorting to a non-spherical geometry. We find that light element
lines, recently detected in a few X-ray afterglows, are expected to dominate
over iron lines for small t_sd, while for large t_sd the situation is reversed.
Finally, we predict that external Compton scattering of the PWB photons by the
afterglow relativistic electrons, should lead to high energy emission during
the early afterglow that may explain the GeV photons detected by EGRET in some
GRBs, and should be detectable by future missions (GLAST).

abundances are derived using measured equivalent widths and Kurucz LTE model
atmospheres as input for the MOOG software package. The input atmospheric
parameters and abundances are iteratively modified until (i) the Fe I
abundances exhibit no trend with excitation potential or equivalent width, (ii)
Fe I and Fe II average abundances are the same and (iii) Fe and Alpha elements
average abundances are consistent with the input values. The second method
follows a similar approach, but relies on the B-V and V-I colour indices to
determine the temperature. The third method relies on fitting the 6162 A Ca I
line wing profiles to derive the surface gravity. The reliability of these
methods is investigated in the context of single line RS CVn stars. It is shown
that the V-I photometric index gives, on a broader sample of stars,
significantly cooler estimates of the effective temperature than the B-V index.
All other approaches give results in good agreement with each other. The
analysis of IS Vir and V851 Cen results in both cases in their primaries being
giant stars of near-solar metallicity. Their parameters as derived with the
first method are respectively Teff = 4720 K, log g = 2.65, [Fe/H] = +0.04 and
Teff = 4700 K, log g = 3.0 and [Fe/H] = -0.13. In the case of V851 Cen the
derived iron content is significantly higher than a previous determination in
the literature. Both stars exhibit relative overabundances of several elements

circumstellar medium, resulting in radiation at wavelengths from radio to
X-rays. IR and optical observations have revealed a wide variety of broad and
narrow emission lines. Examination of the SN/CSM interaction and of the ejecta
spectra has allowed us to deduce that the supernova probably arose from a
massive, RSG progenitor having a large (>3200 AU radius), dusty circumstellar
disk. SN 1998S also developed one of the strongest, most persistent infrared
excesses ever seen in a supernova. IR/optical monitoring of SN 1998S has been
carried out to nearly 1200 days post-explosion. This includes coverage to

and redshifted components of the late-time H I and He I line profiles suggests
strongly that dust condensed in the ejecta. However, it is less clear whether
the strong late-time IR emission arose from this dust, or from an IR echo in
the dusty CSM. One interesting possibility is that dust condensed in the cool
dense shell between the outer and reverse shocks, thus simultaneously producing
both the line obscuration and the IR emission.

The derived algorithm consists of two alternating steps to estimate the dual

one set of parameters is updated by Newton-like procedure, and the other set is
updated by solving a quadratic programming problem. The algorithm converges in
a few steps to a local optimum under mild conditions and it preserves the
sparsity of support vectors. Although the complexity to calculate temporal

matching, is presented. It extends to scaling the method introduced by Bertotti
and the author to create a fully relational dynamics that satisfies Mach's
principle. The method is illustrated here in the context of non-relativistic
gravitational particle dynamics.. It leads to far stronger predictions than
general Newtonian dynamics. The energy and angular momentum of an `island
universe' must be exactly zero and its size, measured by its moment of inertia,
cannot change. This constancy is enforced because the scale invariance requires
all potentials to be homogeneous of degree -2. It is remarkable that one can
nevertheless exactly recover the standard observed Newtonian laws and forces,
which are merely accompanied by an extremally weak universal force like the one
due to Einstein's cosmological constant. In contrast to Newtonian and
Einsteinian dynamics, both the gravitational constant G and the strength of the
cosmological force are uniquely determined by the matter distribution of the
universe. Estimates of their values in agreement with observations are
obtained. Best matching implements a dynamics of pure shape for which the
action is a dimensionless number. If the universe obeys such scale invariant
law, steadily increasing inhomogeneity, not expansion of the universe, causes
the Hubble red shift. The application of best matching to geometrodynamics is
treated in a companion paper.

the transition from circular, equatorial inspiral to plunge for stellar-mass
objects into supermassive ($10^{5}-10^{8}M_{\odot}$) Kerr black holes. We
extend their computation to eccentric Kerr equatorial orbits. Even with orbital
parameters near-exactly determined, we find that there is no universal length
for the transition; rather, the length of the transition depends sensitively --
essentially randomly -- on initial conditions. Still, Ori and Thorne's
zero-eccentricity results are essentially an upper bound on the length of
eccentric transitions involving similar bodies (e.g., $a$ fixed). Hence the
implications for observations are no better: if the massive body is
$M=10^{6}M_{\odot}$, the captured body has mass $m$, and the process occurs at
distance $d$ from LISA, then $S/N \lesssim (m/10
M_{\odot})(1\text{Gpc}/d)\times O(1)$, with the precise constant depending on
the black hole spin. For low-mass bodies ($m \lesssim 7 M_\odot$) for which the
event rate is at least vaguely understood, we expect little chance (probably
[much] less than 10%, depending strongly on the astrophysical assumptions) of
LISA detecting a transition event with $S/N>5$ during its run; however, even a
small infusion of higher-mass bodies or a slight improvement in LISA's noise

work, based on a torus fibered Calabi-Yau manifold with a del Pezzo base dP_7,a
three generation SU(5)model with Wilson line breaking to the Standard Model was
constructed. It was seen that if the additional 5- branes clustered near the
distant orbifold plane, it was possible that such models could generate the
observed hierarchies of quark masses without undue fine tuning. We update these
results here and extend them to include the charged leptons. A new mechanism
for generating small neutrino masses (different from the ususal seesaw
mechanism)arises naturally from a possible cubic holomorphic term in the Kahler
potential when supersymmetry is broken. We show that the LMA solution to
neutrino masses can occur, with a good fit to all neutrino oscillation data.
The model implies the existance of the \mu -> e \gamma decay even for universal
slepton soft breaking masses, at rates accessible to the next round of
experiments.

we study the explicit breaking of an internal symmetry in addition to Lorentz
invariance using two--color QCD at nonzero baryonic chemical potential.
Finally, we consider the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry using three-color
QCD at nonzero baryonic and isospin chemical potential. For each case, we
derive the appropriate three-dimensional effective theory at criticality and
study the effect of the chemical potential on the fixed point structure of the

and the (possibly deformed) Lorentz symmetry, as proposed recently by several
authors. Since it is known that the Lie group structure of the Lorentz group
cannot be deformed, we study the deformations (up to isomorphisms) of the
mass-shell, considered as an abstract three-dimensional homogeneous space. We
find that in the massive case the mass-shell cannot be deformed and in the
massless case there are deformations, but their physical interpretation is
problematic. The components of the four-momentum are considered as (redundant)
coordinates on the abstract mass-shell. Reinterpreting an old result, we note
that if the four-momentum is conserved its components must be the usual ones,
with linear Lorentz transformation properties. Even if four-momentum is not
conserved at high center-of-mass energies, the linearly transforming
coordinates can always be used to describe in a convenient way the kinematics
of collision processes and they satisfy the GKZ cutoff. We suggest that, if one
wants to save the relativity principle, one should look for new physics in the
collisions between the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and the nuclei of the high

neutron rich matter. Particularly interesting is the density dependence of the
equation of state (EOS). For example, the softening of the EOS at high density,
where the pressure rises slower than anticipated, could signal a transition to
an exotic phase. However, extracting the density dependence of the EOS requires
measuring the radii of neutron stars for a broad range of masses. A ``normal''
1.4 solar mass neutron star has a central density of a few times nuclear-matter
saturation density. In contrast, low mass (of the order of 0.5 solar masses)
neutron stars have central densities near nuclear-matter saturation density so
its radius provides information on the EOS at low density. Unfortunately,
low-mass stars are rare because they may be hard to form. Instead, a precision
measurement of nuclear radii on atomic nuclei may contain similar information.
Indeed, we find a strong correlation between the neutron radius of 208Pb and
the radius of a 0.5 solar-mass neutron star. Thus, the radius of such a neutron
star can be inferred from a measurement of the the neutron radius of 208Pb.
Comparing this value to the measured radius of a 1.4 solar-mass neutron star
should provide the strongest constraint to date on the density dependence of
the equation of state.

Rev. ST AB",,,,"physics.acc-ph physics.atom-ph",,"  A new type of charge-exchange injection scheme for high-intensity proton
rings that use a laser beam and an undulator magnet is proposed. The elementary
stripping process is resonant photoionization via a broad Stark state formed by
the Stark effect at an energy level near the peak of the potential barrier. The
method used to estimate the parameters of the necessary laser beam and magnetic
field is described. As an application to an actual accelerator, a laser
stripping system using a high-finesse Fabry-Perot resonator and an undulator is
proposed. An estimation of the photon loss due to the pumping-up of H$^0$
atoms, tunability of the system and the emittance growth due to stripping in
the undulator magnet is also given.

conventional Bell and Stirling numbers and to appropriate generalisations of
the Dobinski relations. These new combinatorial numbers are shown to be
coherent state matrix elements of powers of the monomials in question. It is
further demonstrated that such Bell-type numbers, when considered as power
moments, give rise to positive measures on the positive half-axis, which in
many cases can be written in terms of known functions.

algorithms. We have compared various spin-based quantum computing schemes to
implement the QFT from the point of view of their actual time-costs and the
accuracy of the implementation. We focus here on an interesting decomposition
of the QFT as a product of the non-selective Hadamard transformation followed
by multiqubit gates corresponding to square- and higher-roots of controlled-NOT
gates. This decomposition requires only O(n) operations and is thus linear in
the number of qubits $n$. The schemes were implemented on a two-qubit NMR
quantum information processor and the resultant density matrices reconstructed
using standard quantum state tomography techniques. Their experimental
fidelities have been measured and compared.

independently of statistical assumptions. When data consistent with its

  (Lunteren, 2002)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We present a robust continuous optical loading scheme for a Ioffe-Pritchard
(IP) type magnetic trap. Atoms are cooled and trapped in a modified
magneto-optical trap (MOT) consisting of a conventional 2D-MOT in radial
direction and an axial molasses. The radial magnetic field gradient needed for
the operation of the 2D-MOT is provided by the IP trap. A small axial curvature
and offset field provide magnetic confinement and suppress spin-flip losses in
the center of the magnetic trap without altering the performance of the 2D-MOT.
Continuous loading of atoms into the IP trap is provided by radiative leakage
from the MOT to a metastable level which is magnetically trapped and decoupled
from the MOT light. We are able to accumulate 30 times more atoms in the
magnetic trap than in the MOT. The absolute number of $2\times 10^8$~atoms is
limited by inelastic collisions. A model based on rate equations shows good
agreement with our data. Our scheme can also be applied to other atoms with
similar level structure like alkaline earth metals.
