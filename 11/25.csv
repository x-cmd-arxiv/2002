"astro-ph/0211526","Neal J. Evans II","N. J. Evans II","Studying Infall",,,,,"astro-ph",,"  The study of protostellar collapse or infall has proven unusually difficult
and controversial. Some historical context will be provided, against which
recent advances can be measured. We now have a substantial number of objects
with signatures that can be interpreted in terms of collapse, but a number of
issues remain. One issue is the effect of chemical variations, especially
depletion in the dense, cold interiors of cores that are likely to form low
mass stars. Strategies for dealing with this issue depend on using dust
emission to constrain the density and temperature distribution, leaving
molecular line observations to constrain dynamics and abundance distributions.
Recent progress in this area will be described and we will consider the next
challenges to be overcome. Interferometeric observations, especially with
future instruments, will provide a powerful tool. In combination with chemical
studies coupled with dynamical models, the observations made possible by
interferometers should finally put this subject on a firm foundation.

these integrated spectra to calculate the levels of contribution of SBGs to the

a level of few percent for q up to 3, and in the range of 5%-15% for q ~ 4.5.

global properties of Virgo Cluster galaxies. The observed sample was selected
based on previous 12CO(J=1->0) detections by Stark et al. (1986), performed
with the AT&T Bell Laboratory 7m telescope (beam size 100""). We were able to
detect 18 spiral galaxies in 12CO(2->1) and 16 in 12CO(3->2). Beam matched
observations of the lowest three 12CO transitions allow us to compare our
results with previous high spatial resolution studies of (moderate) starburst
galaxies and galactic core regions. We discuss the global excitation conditions
of the ISM in these quiescent spiral galaxies. The resulting CO (3--2)/(1--0)
integrated line ratios vary over a relatively narrow range of values from 0.35
to 0.14 (on a K km/s-scale) with increasing CO (2--1)/(1--0) ratio (from 0.5 to
1.1). The line ratios between the three lowest rotational transitions of CO
cannot be fitted by any radiative transfer model with a single source
component. A two-component model, assuming a warm, dense nuclear and a cold,
less dense disc component allows us to fit the observed line ratios for most of
the galaxies individually by selecting suitable parameters. The two-component
model, however, fails to explain the observed correlation of the line ratios.
This is due to a variation of the relative filling factor of the warm gas
alone, assuming a typical set of parameters for the two components common for
all galaxies.

  Proceedings of AAAI-2000 and Proceedings of KI-2001",,,,"cs.LO cs.AI",,"  Answer-set programming (ASP) paradigm is a way of using logic to solve search
problems. Given a search problem, to solve it one designs a theory in the logic
so that models of this theory represent problem solutions. To compute a
solution to a problem one needs to compute a model of the corresponding theory.
Several answer-set programming formalisms have been developed on the basis of
logic programming with the semantics of stable models. In this paper we show
that also the logic of predicate calculus gives rise to effective
implementations of the ASP paradigm, similar in spirit to logic programming
with stable model semantics and with a similar scope of applicability.
Specifically, we propose two logics based on predicate calculus as formalisms
for encoding search problems. We show that the expressive power of these logics
is given by the class NP-search. We demonstrate how to use them in programming
and develop computational tools for model finding. In the case of one of the
logics our techniques reduce the problem to that of propositional
satisfiability and allow one to use off-the-shelf satisfiability solvers. The
language of the other logic has more complex syntax and provides explicit means
to model some high-level constraints. For theories in this logic, we designed
our own solver that takes advantage of the expanded syntax. We present
experimental results demonstrating computational effectiveness of the overall
approach.

becomes feasible at a future linear collider(LC), it may be possible to use
spin rotators to produce transversely polarized beams. Using the transverse
polarization of both beams, new azimuthal spin asymmetries can be formed which
will be sensitive probes for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Here we
demonstrate that these asymmetries are particularly sensitive to the exchange
of Kaluza-Klein towers of gravitons, or other spin-2 fields, that are predicted
to exist in higher dimensional theories which address the hierarchy problem.
These new asymmetries are shown to be able to extend the search reach for such
new physics by more than a factor of two, provide an additional tool for
isolating the signatures for spin-2 exchange up to mass scales in excess of
$10\sqrt s$, and can be used to help differentiate among the proposed solutions
to the hierarchy problem below the production threshold for new particles.

present paper is to get a better understanding of the Master Ward Identity by
analyzing its meaning in classical field theory. It turns out that it is the
most general identity for classical local fields which follows from the field
equations. It is equivalent to a generalization of the Schwinger-Dyson Equation
and is closely related to the Quantum Action Principle of Lowenstein and Lam.

equations with polynomial coefficients having a polynomial solution of a

[He], [St]. Their result can be reformulated in terms of the Schubert calculus
as follows: the critical points label the elements of the intersection of
certain Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian of two-dimensional subspaces of
the space of complex polynomials, [S1].
  In a hundred years after the works of Heine and Stieltjes, it was established
that the same critical points determine the Bethe vectors in the sl_2 Gaudin
model, [G]. Recently it was proved that the Bethe vectors of the sl_2 Gaudin
model form a basis of the subspace of singular vectors of a given weight in the
tensor product of irreducible sl_2-representations, [SV].
  In the present work we generalize the result of Heine and Stieltjes to linear
differential equations of order p>2. The function, which determines elements in
the intersection of corresponding Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian of
p-dimensional subspaces, turns out to be the very function which appears in the
sl_p Gaudin model.
  In the case when the space of states of the Gaudin model is the tensor
product of symmetric powers of the standard sl_p-representation, we prove that
the Bethe vectors form a basis of the subspace of singular vectors of a given

most useful problem -- the Ito-g sigma linearization is solved using the

strong force between the sides of two lattices. The strong nuclear force is the
sum of the unsaturated weak forces at the sides of each lattice and is
therefore 10^6 times stronger than the weak force.

those occuring in the classical potential required? What is the error of the
parametrisation estimated from the numerical fit? How about convergence and
stability of the fitting method (dependence on grid points, resolution, initial
conditions, internal precision etc.)? Further we compare two methods of
numerical determination of the quantum action: (i) global fit of the Q.M.
transition amplitudes and (ii) flow equation. As model we consider the inverse
square potential, for which the Q.M. transition amplitudes are analytically
known. We find that the relative error of the parametrisation starts from zero
at T=0 increases to about $10^{-3}$ at $T=1/E_{gr}$ and then decreases to zero
when $T \to \infty$. Second, we observe stability of the quantum action under
variation of the control parameters. Finally, the flow equation method works
well in the regime of large $T$ giving stable results under variation of
initial data and consistent with the global fit method.

optical Stark effect. This approach has been used to split spin states in
colloidal CdSe quantum dots and to manipulate ensembles of spins in ZnMnSe
quantum wells with femtosecond optical pulses. Here we report that the process
will produce a coherent rotation of spin in quantum dots containing a single
electron. The calculated magnitude of the effective magnetic field depends on
the dot bandgap and the strain. We predict that in InAs/InP dots, for
reasonable experimental parameters, the magnitude of the rotation is sufficient
and the intrinsic error is low enough for them to serve as elements of a
quantum dot based quantum computer.

manifested globally as the time-asymmetry of the universe as a whole, and
