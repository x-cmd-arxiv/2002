Based on the redshift-dependent intercept of the fundamental plane in the rest
frame B band, we measure an evolution rate of d log (M/L)_B / dz = -0.56 +/-
0.04 (all errors are 1 sigma unless noted) if we directly compare to the local
intercept measured from the Coma cluster. Re-fitting the local intercept helps
minimize potential systematic errors, and yields an evolution rate of d log
(M/L)_B / dz = -0.54 +/- 0.09. An evolution analysis of properly-corrected
aperture mass-to-light ratios (defined by the lensed image separations) is
closely related to the Faber-Jackson relation. In rest frame B band we find an
evolution rate of d log (M/L)_B / dz = -0.41 +/- 0.21, a present-day
characteristic magnitude of M_{*0} = -19.70 + 5 log h +/- 0.29 (assuming a
characteristic velocity dispersion of sigma_{DM*} = 225 km/s), and a
Faber-Jackson slope of gamma_{FJ} = 3.29 +/- 0.58. The measured evolution rates
favor old stellar populations (mean formation redshift z_f > 1.8 at 2 sigma
confidence for a Salpeter initial mass function and a flat Omega_m =0.3

episodes of star formation at z < 1.

a transient absorption edge discovered in the X-ray spectrum of GRB990705. This
burst is therefore the first GRB for which a reliable redshift was derived from
the prompt phase emission itself, as opposed to redshift determinations
performed using putative host galaxy emission lines or intestellar absorption
lines in the GRB afterglows. Deep and high resolution images of the host of
GRB990705 with the HST/STIS camera reveal that the burst occured in a nearly
face-on Sc spiral galaxy typical of disk-dominated systems at 0.75<z<1.

Two-component Hernquist galaxy models were also used to study the effect of
massive dark halos on the end-products characteristics. We have also performed
new collapse simulations including initial spin. We found that the
one-component Hernquist mergers give results similar to those found for the
one-component King models, namely both were able to build-up small scatter
FP-like correlations with slopes consistent with what is found for the
near-infrared FP of nearby galaxies. The two-component models also reproduce a
FP-like correlation, but with a significantly steeper slope. This is in
agreement with what has been found for elliptical galaxies at higher redshift
(0.1 $<$ z $<$ 0.6). We discuss some structural properties of the simulated
galaxies and their ability to build-up FP-like correlations. We confirm that
collapses generally do not follow a FP-like correlation regardless of the
initial spin. We suggest that the evolution of gradients in the gravitational
field of the merging galaxies may be the main ingredient dictating the final

test the disk hypothesis is to search for outflow signatures perpendicular to
the methanol maser distributions. The main objective of the survey was to
obtain wide-field near-infrared images of the sites of linearly distributed
methanol masers using a narrow-band 2.12 micron filter which is centered on the
H2 v=1-0 S(1) line. This line is a shock diagnostic that has been shown to
successfully trace CO outflows from young stellar objects. Twenty-eight sources

only TWO sources showed emission found to be dominantly perpendicular to the

are i) experimentally measured level and weak decay information, ii) estimates
of matrix elements for allowed experimentally-unmeasured transitions based on
the systematics of experimentally observed allowed transitions, and iii)
estimates of the centroids of the GT resonances motivated by shell model
calculations in the fp shell as well as by (n,p) and (p,n) experiments.
Transitions involving Fermi resonances (isobaric analog states) are also

which an experimentally-determined ground state lifetime is unavailable. To
compare our results with more detailed shell model based calculations we also
calculate weak rates for nuclei in the mass range A=60-65 for which Langanke

capture and B- decay rates for these ~30 nuclei is less than a factor of two or
three for a wide range of temperature and density appropriate for pre-supernova

partition functions used in calculations of stellar weak rates and show that
the proper treatment of the partition functions is essential for estimating

monitoring observations of the complete Pearson-Readhead extragalactic source
sample obtained between August 1984 and March 2001, we identify the range of
variability in extragalactic objects as functions of optical and radio
morphological classification, and relate total flux density variations to
structural changes in published coeval VLBI maps in selected objects. We have
identified preferred orientations of the electric vector of the polarized
emission at 14.5 and 4.8 GHz in roughly half of the objects, and compared these
with orientations of the flow direction indicated by VLBI morphology. When
comparing the distributions of the orientation offsets for the BL Lacs and for
the QSOs, we find differences in both range and mean value, in support of
intrinsic class differences. In the shock-in-jet scenario, we attribute this to
the allowed range of obliquities of shocks developing in the flow relative to
the flow direction. The fact that we find longterm stability in EVPA over many
events implies that a dominant magnetic field orientation persists; in the
core-dominated objects, with small contribution from the underlying quiescent
jet, this plausibly suggests that the magnetic field has a longterm memory,
with subsequent shock events exhibiting similar EVPA orientation, or,
alternatively, the presence of a standing shock in the core. We have looked for
systematic, monotonic changes in EVPA which might be expected in the emission
from a precessing jet, a model currently invoked for some AGNs; none were
identified. Further, we carried out a Scargle periodogram analysis of the total
flux density observations, but found no strong evidence for periodicity in any

directly fitting the observed spectrum with synthetic spectra. We make direct
use of NextGen model atmospheres intensities which are the most comprehensive
and detailed models available for cool stars. We fully take into account the
varying temperature and gravity across the secondary star's photosphere, by
incorporating the synthetic spectra into the secondary star's Roche geometry.
As a result, we determine the exact rotationally broadened spectrum of the
secondary star and so eliminate the need for a limb-darkening law, and the
uncertainties associated with it. As an example we determine the mass ratio for
the well studied soft X-ray transient Nova Sco 1994. In order to obtain a more
accurate determination of the mass ratio, which does not depend on assumptions
about the rotation profile and limb-darkening coefficients, we use our model to
compute the exact rotationally broadened model spectrum, which we compare
directly with the observed intermediate resolution spectrum of Nova Sco 1994.
We determine the mass ratio of Nova Sco 1994 to be 0.419+/-0.028 (90 percent
confidence), which is the most accurate determination of the binary mass ratio
in an X-ray binary. This result combined with the binary mass function and
inclination angle gives a refined black hole mass of 5.99+\-0.42 Mo (90 percent
confidence). We also perform simulations which show that, for an F-type
secondary star, the standard rotation profile with zero and continuum value for
the line limb-darkening coefficient gives a value for q that brackets the value
found using the full geometrical treatment.

isotopic ratios in the convective envelope during the TP-AGB phase of evolution
in a 1.5 M_sun initial-mass star of solar initial composition. We use a
parametric model which treats extra mixing by introducing mass flow between the
convective envelope and the underlying radiative zone. The parameters of this
model are the mass circulation rate (Mdot) and the maximum temperature (T_P)
experienced by the circulating material. The effects of nuclear reactions in
the flowing matter were calculated using a set of structures of the radiative
zone selected from a complete stellar evolution calculation. The compositions
of the flowing material were obtained and the resulting changes in the envelope
determined. Abundant ^26Al was produced by CBP for log T_P > 7.65. While
^26Al/^27Al depends on T_P, the isotopic ratios in CNO elements depend
dominantly on the circulation rate. The correspondence is shown between models
of CBP as parameterized by a diffusion formalism within the stellar evolution
model and those using the mass-flow formalism employed here. The isotopic
ratios are compared with the data on circumstellar dust grains. It is found
that the ratios ^{18}O/^{16}O, ^{17}O/^{16}O, and ^26Al/^27Al observed for
oxide grains formed at C/O < 1 are reasonably well-understood. However, the
^15N/^14N, ^12C/^13C, and ^26Al/^27Al in carbide grains (C/O > 1) require many

Based on the available data it is not possible to conclusively determine the
mechanism of ionization. Both photo-ionization, from a rapidly evolving central
star, and shock excitation, as the result of the collision of the fast ouflows
with slower circumstellar matter, could account for the observed lines. The
central star is still hidden behind strong dust absorption, since only a faint
highly reddened continuum is apparent in the spectra. Theory states that it
will become hotter and will retrace its post-asymptotic giant branch evolution
towards the planetary nebula domain. Our detection of the ionized ejecta from

contain several scalar moduli fields which will be relevant to early Universe
cosmology. Some of these fields are expected to couple with non-standard
kinetic terms to gravity. In this paper, we study the splitting into adiabatic
and isocurvature perturbations for a model with two scalar fields, one of which
has a non-standard kinetic term in the Einstein-frame action. Such actions can
arise, e.g., in the Pre-Big-Bang and Ekpyrotic scenarios. The presence of a
non-standard kinetic term induces a new coupling between adiabatic and
isocurvature perturbations which is non-vanishing when the potential for the
matter fields is nonzero. This coupling is un-suppressed in the long wavelength
limit and thus can lead to an important transfer of power from the entropy to
the adiabatic mode on super-Hubble scales. We apply the formalism to the case
of a previously found exact solution with an exponential potential and study
the resulting mixing of adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations in this
example. We also discuss the possible relevance of the extra coupling in the
perturbation equations for the process of generating an adiabatic component of
the fluctuations spectrum from isocurvature perturbations without considering a
later decay of the isocurvature component.

that the offset of the BCG is correlated with the dynamical equilibrium state

between the absolute optical magnitude of the BCG and the parameter $Z$. If the
extreme brightness of the BCG is mainly acquired in the course of cluster
evolution by environmental effect, BCGs are expected to be brighter in large

from the dust to the gas plays an important role for driving winds of AGB
stars. Therefore a detailed description of the interaction of gas and dust is a
prerequisite for realistic models of such winds. In this paper we present the
method and first results of a three-component time-dependent model of
dust-driven AGB star winds. With the model we plan to study the role and
effects of the gas-dust interaction on the mass loss and wind formation. The
wind model includes separate conservation laws for each of the three components
of gas, dust and the radiation field and is developed from an existing model
which assumes position coupling between the gas and the dust. As a new feature
we introduce a separate equation of motion for the dust component in order to
fully separate the dust phase from the gas phase. The transfer of mass, energy
and momentum between the phases is treated by interaction terms. We also carry
out a detailed study of the physical form and influence of the momentum
transfer term (the drag force) and three approximations to it. In the present
study we are interested mainly in the effect of the new treatment of the dust
velocity on dust-induced instabilities in the wind. As we want to study the
consequences of the additional freedom of the dust velocity on the model we
calculate winds both with and without the separate dust equation of motion. The
wind models are calculated for several sets of stellar parameters. We find that
there is a higher threshold in the carbon/oxygen abundance ratio at which winds
form in the new model. The winds of the new models, which include drift, differ
from the previously stationary winds, and the winds with the lowest mass loss
rates no longer form.

claiming that the present universe is accelerating, being driven by some
hypothetical source with negative pressure collectively known as {\it dark

in the laboratory. These models are motivated by the high redshift supernovae
Ia observations. Though low density models, without dark energy, also appear to
fit the SN Ia data reasonably well, however, they are ruled out by the CMB
observations.
  In this paper, we present a warped brane model with an additional surface
term of brane curvature scalar in the action. This results in shifting the {\it
dynamical curvature} of the model from its {\it geometrical} counterpart, which
creates profound consequences. Even for \Lambda=0, the low energy decelerating
model successfully explains the observed locations of the peaks in the angular
power spectrum of CMB. This model also fits the high redshift supernovae Ia
observations, taken together with the recently observed SN 1997ff at z~1.7,
very well. Additionally, it also fits the data on the angular size and redshift
of the compact radio sources very well.

to the 3:1 mean motion resonance between the two planets). Additionally we
computed the orbits of earthlike planets (up to 90 earthmasses) in the small

shows a ferrimagnetic-like curvature. We approached the discussion of these

(x>=0.15), the CW behaviour is observed down to the magnetic ordering
temperature (Tmo) and a better description of c(T) was obtained by assuming
full delocalization of the eg electrons. In order to explore the degree of
delocalization as a function of T and x, we analyzed the problem through
Montecarlo simulations. Within this picture we found that at high T the
electrons doped are completely delocalized but, when Tmo is approached, they
form magnetic polarons of large spin that cause the observed curvature in
c^-1(T) for x<=0.1.

classically stable objects, stabilized by the presence of conserved charges
trapped on the vortex core. These objects carry angular momentum which
counteracts the effect of the string tension that causes the loops to shrink.
The existence of such quasiparticles, which are called vortons, could be
interesting for the physics of high temperature superconductors. We also

additional electron doping in this correlated metal. A gradual enhancement of
the electronic part of specific heat and a more drastic increase of the static
magnetic susceptibility were observed in Sr(2-y)La(y)RuO(4) with increasing y.
Furthermore, the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi-liquid behavior seen in pure
Sr2RuO4 breaks down near the critical concentration y ~ 0.20. Combined with a
realistic tight-binding model with rigid-band shift of Fermi level, the
enhancement of the density of states can be ascribed to the elevation of the
Fermi energy toward a van Hove singularity of the thermodynamically dominant
\gamma Fermi-surface sheet. On approaching the van Hove singularity, the
effective nesting-vector of the \gamma band shrinks and further enhances the
susceptibility near the wave vector q ~ 0. We attribute the non-Fermi-liquid
behavior to two-dimensional ferromagnetic fluctuations with short range
correlations at the van Hove singularity. The observed behavior is in sharp
contrast to that of Ti(4+) substitution in Sr2RuO4 which enhances
antiferromagnetic fluctuations and subsequently induces incommensurate magnetic
ordering associated with the nesting between the other Fermi-surface sheets
(\alpha and \beta). We thus establish that substitution of appropriate chemical
dopants can band-selectively modify the spin-fluctuation spectrum in the
spin-triplet superconductor Sr2RuO4.

that, at not very low frequencies, one can reduce the $\sigma$-model to a
one-dimensional $\sigma$-model on periodic orbits. Solving the latter model,
first approximately and then exactly, we resolve the problem of repetitions.

84, 2000); but, the width of the virtual time horizon diverges (i.e., the
measurement phase of the algorithm does not scale). In this work, we introduce
a moving window global constraint, which modifies the algorithm so that the
measurement phase scales as well. We present results of systematic studies in
which the system size (i.e., L and the volume load per processor) as well as
the constraint are varied. The constraint eliminates the extreme fluctuations
in the virtual time horizon, provides a bound on its width, and controls the
average progress rate. The width of the window constraint can serve as a tuning
parameter that, for a given volume load per processor, could be adjusted to
optimize the utilization so as to maximize the efficiency. This result may find
numerous applications in modeling the evolution of general spatially extended
short-range interacting systems with asynchronous dynamics, including dynamic
Monte Carlo studies.

in critical phenomena, we attempt to block up D-branes by averaging over near
neighbour elements of their (in general noncommuting) matrix coordinates, i.e.\
in a low energy description. We show that various D-brane (noncommutative)
geometries arising in string theory appear to behave sensibly under blocking
up, given certain key assumptions in particular involving gauge invariance. In
particular, the (gauge-fixed) noncommutative plane, fuzzy sphere and torus
exhibit a self-similar structure under blocking up, if some ``counterterm''
matrices are added to the resulting block-algebras. Applying these techniques
to matrix representations of more general D-brane configurations, we find that
blocking up averages over far-off-diagonal matrix elements and brings them in
towards the diagonal, so that the matrices become ``less off-diagonal'' under

underlying such a matrix coarse-graining. We also discuss briefly
interrelations of these ideas with B-fields and noncommutativity.

Phong","Lectures on Two-Loop Superstrings","37 pages, 3 figures, Lectures delivered at Hangzhou and Beijing 2002",,,"UCLA/02/TEP/28 - Columbia/Math/02","hep-th math.CV",,"  In these lectures, recent progress on multiloop superstring perturbation
theory is reviewed. A construction from first principles is given for an
unambiguous and slice-independent two-loop superstring measure on moduli space
for even spin structure. A consistent choice of moduli, invariant under local
worldsheet supersymmetry is made in terms of the super-period matrix. A variety
of subtle new contributions arising from a careful gauge fixing procedure are
taken into account.
  The superstring measure is computed explicitly in terms of genus two
theta-functions and reveals the importance of a new modular object of weight 6.
For given even spin structure, the measure exhibits a behavior under
degenerations of the worldsheet that is consistent with physical principles.
The measure allows for a unique modular covariant GSO projection. Under this
GSO projection, the cosmological constant, the 1-, 2- and 3- point functions of
massless supergravitons vanish pointwise on moduli space. A certain
disconnected part of the 4-point function is shown to be given by a convergent
integral on moduli space. A general consistent formula is given for the
two-loop cosmological constant in compactifications with central charge c=15
and with N=1 worldsheet supersymmetry. Finally, some comments are made on
possible extensions of this work to higher loop order.

a certain amount of energy. This is arbitrarily small in Classical Physics, due
to the continuous nature of the energy parameter, while one cannot reduce that
amount below Planck's energy quanta in Quantum Physics. In short, one cannot
send less than a photon from a place to another when transmitting a minimum of
information. However, as single photons are never completely defined
simultaneously in all their parameters as position and momentum, their exact
contribution to the information transmitted cannot be known in advance, but
only probabilistically predicted. So the information transmitted is always
blurred before one can - in a way that is only probabilistically predictable -
localize or, alternatively, determine the momenta of the photons transporting
it. In order to enhance the information content of a message, is it then really
possible to exploit the situation by considering the information contained in a
superposition state before localization or, alternatively, determination of
momenta? It would be so if such blurred information were richer than a defined
one, the former being vaguer than the latter as it would be compatible with
more possible outputs, and only in this sense more extensive. But if one
defines the information content of a state as the negative logarithm of the
probability of the state itself, it is not possible to identify the more a
priori probable blurred information pertaining to that state with the bigger
one. Then the idea of exploiting a supposedly enhanced information content of
superposition states in Quantum Computation seems to contradict directly - but,
as we will se, without necessity - the classical probabilistic definition of
information.

operational errors, and quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes are the keys to
solving this problem. Of course, just the existence of codes is not efficient.
It is necessary to perform operations fault-tolerantly on encoded states
because error-correction process (i.e., encoding, decoding, syndrome
measurement and recovery) itself induces an error. By using simulation, this
paper investigates the effects of some important QEC codes (the five qubit
code, the seven qubit code and the nine qubit code) and their fault-tolerant
operations when the error-correction process itself induces an error. The
corresponding results, statistics and analyses are presented in this paper.

gas-filled cylinders. We consider particularly two-level agents such as
electrons immersed in a magnetic field. Work is produced in that case when the
electrons are being carried from a high-magnetic-field region into a
low-magnetic-field region. In watermills, work is produced instead when some
amount of fluid drops from a high-altitude reservoir to a low-altitude
reservoir. We show that this purely mechanical engine may in fact be considered
as a two-level quantum heat engine, provided the fluid is viewed as consisting
of n molecules of weight one and N-n molecules of weight zero. Weight-one
molecules are analogous to electrons in their higher energy state, while
weight-zero molecules are analogous to electrons in their lower energy state.
More generally, fluids consist of non-interacting molecules of various weights.
It is shown that, not only the average value of the work produced per cycle,
but also its fluctuations, are the same for mechanical engines and quantum
(Otto) heat engines. The reversible Carnot cycles are approached through the
consideration of multiple sub-reservoirs.

  incompatibility of observations on composite systems and nonexistence of the
  Kolmogorov probability space; last section of the paper",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The probabilistic structure of quantum mechanics is investigated in the
frequency framework. Such an approach can be interpreted as a contextual
approach to quantum probabilities. By using rather complicated frequency
calculations we reproduce the EPR-Bohm correlation function which is typically
derived by using the calculus of probabilities in a Hilbert space. Our
frequency probabilistic model of the EPR-Bohm experiment is a realist model --
physical observables are considered as objective properties of physical
systems. It is also local -- a measurement over one part of a composite system
does not disturb another part of this system. Nevertheless, our result does not
contradict to the well known Bell's ``NO-GO'' theorem. J. Bell used the
conventional (Kolmogorov) measure-theoretical approach. We use the frequency
approach. In the latter approach there are no reasons to assume that the
simultaneous probability distribution exists: corresponding frequencies may
fluctuate and not approach any definite limit (which Bell would like to use as
the probability). The frequency probabilistic derivation demonstrated that
incompatibility of observables under consideration plays the crucial role in
producing of the EPR-Bohm correlations.

appearance of long-range correlations. These correlations are not due to
thermal fluctuations but to the intricate structure of a strongly entangled
ground state of the system. We present a microscopic computation of the scaling
properties of the ground-state entanglement in several 1D spin chain models
both near and at the quantum critical regimes. We quantify entanglement by
using the entropy of the ground state when the system is traced down to $L$
spins. This entropy is seen to scale logarithmically with $L$, with a
coefficient that corresponds to the central charge associated to the conformal
theory that describes the universal properties of the quantum phase transition.
Thus we show that entanglement, a key concept of quantum information science,
obeys universal scaling laws as dictated by the representations of the
conformal group and its classification motivated by string theory. This
connection unveils a monotonicity law for ground-state entanglement along the
renormalization group flow. We also identify a majorization rule possibly
associated to conformal invariance and apply the present results to interpret
the breakdown of density matrix renormalization group techniques near a
critical point.
