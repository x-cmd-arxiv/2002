combining all currently available observational techniques (X-ray,
gravitational lensing, dynamics, SZ) on homogeneous samples if one wants to
understand their evolution and physical properties. This is particularly
important in order to relate the observable quantities to the cosmologically
important cluster mass. We present here a number of on-going projects that aim
at studying cluster physics for samples based on currently available all-sky
X-ray surveys such as XBACs, BCS and MACS.

lines are unsaturated, so meaningful optical depths (equivalently, mass loss
rate times ionization fractions), as a function of wind velocity can be
determined. Ratios of these quantities give the relative ionization as a
function of velocity and demonstrate that, except for O VI in all stars and S
VI in the later stars, the wind ionization shifts toward lower stages at higher
velocity. Because O VI and S VI do not behave like the other ions, they must be
produced by a different mechanism. Using mass-loss rates determined from the
Vink et al. relationships, we derive mean ionization fractions. Because these
are all less than one, the derived mass loss rates cannot be too small.
However, the ion fractions for P V (expected to be dominant in some winds),
never exceed 0.20. This implies that either the calculated mass loss rates or
the assumed P abundances are too large, or the winds are strongly clumped. We
examine correlations between the mean ion fractions and stellar parameters, and
find two significant relationships. First, as expected, the mean ionization
fraction of lower ions decreases with increasing temperature. Second, the mean
ionization fraction of S VI in the latest stars and O VI in all stars increases
with terminal velocity, re-affirming Cassinelli and Olson's conjecture that O
VI is produced non-radiatively. Finally, we discuss peculiar aspects of three

line confirming that unexpected enhancements recently detected in the iron line
of some AGNs can be produced by this effect. We use a ray tracing method to
study the influence of microlensing in the emission coming from a compact
accretion disc considering both geometries, Schwarzschild and Kerr.
  Thanks to the small dimensions of the region producing the AGN Fe K-alpha
line, the Einstein Ring Radii associated to even very small compact objects
have size comparable to the accretion disc hence producing noticeable changes
in the line profiles. Asymmetrical enhancements contributing differently to the
peaks or to the core of the line are produced by a microlens, off-centered with
respect to the accretion disc.
  In the standard configuration of microlensing by a compact object in an
intervening galaxy, we found that the effects on the iron line are two orders
of magnitude larger than those expected in the optical or UV emission lines. In
particular, microlensing can satisfactorily explain the excess in the iron line
emission found very recently in two gravitational lens systems, H 1413+117 and
MG J0414+0534.
  Exploring other physical {scenario} for microlensing, we found that compact
objects (of the order of one Solar mass) which belong to {the bulge or the
halo} of the host galaxy can also produce significant changes in the Fe
K$_\alpha$ line profile of an AGN. However, the optical depth estimated for
this type of microlensing is {very small, $\tau\sim 0.001$, even in a favorable

pair potentials are derived by inverting the CM pair distribution function,
generated in Monte Carlo simulations, using the hypernetted chain (HNC)
closure. The method, previously devised for the self-avoiding walk model of
polymers in good solvent, is extended to the case of polymers in solvents of
variable quality by adding a finite nearest-neighbor monomer-monomer attraction
to the previous model and varying the temperature. The resulting effective pair
potential is found to depend strongly on temperature and polymer concentration.
At low concentration the effective interaction becomes increasingly attractive
as the temperature decreases, eventually violating thermodynamic stability
criteria. However, as polymer concentration is increased at fixed temperature,
the effective interaction reverts to mostly repulsive behavior. These issues
help illustrate some fundamental difficulties encountered when coarse-graining

When one-loop supersymmetric thresholds are included, this unified fixed point

mixing angle. The bottom quark mass prediction is sensitive to the
supersymmetric thresholds; it approaches the measured value for mu <0 and very
large unified gaugino mass. The experimental measurement of the tau lepton mass
determines tan(beta), and the strong gauge coupling and fine structure constant
fix the unification scale and the unified gauge coupling.
