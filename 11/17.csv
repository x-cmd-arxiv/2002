accelerating. Applying the holographic entropy conjecture to the cosmological
horizon in an accelerating universe suggests the universe has only a finite
number of degrees of freedom. This is consistent with a closed universe arising
from a quantum fluctuation, with zero total quantum numbers. If space-time has
eleven dimensions, and the universe began as a closed force-symmetric
ten-dimensional space with characteristic dimension L, seven of the space
dimensions must have collapsed to generate the three large space dimensions we
see. The holographic conjecture then suggests the initial length scale L must
be roughly twenty orders of magnitude larger than the Planck length.
Accordingly, the nuclear force must be roughly forty orders of magnitude
stronger than gravity, possibly resolving the force hierarchy problem. A
wavefunction for the radius of curvature of the universe can be obtained from
the Schrodinger equation derived by Elbaz and Novello. The product of this
wavefunction and its complex conjugate can be interpreted as the probability
density for finding a given radius of curvature in one of the infinity of
measurements of the radius of curvature possible (in principle) at any location
in a homogeneous isotropic universe.

the LMA solution with its best fit point a combined analysis of the KamLAND and

operators with singular real-valued potentials from the space $W^{-1}_2(0,1)$.
The potential is recovered via the eigenvalues and the corresponding norming
constants. The reconstruction algorithm is presented and its stability proved.
Also, the set of all possible spectral data is explicitly described and the
isospectral sets are characterized.

discriminantal hyperplane arrangement with coefficients in local systems
arising in the context of the representation theory of the Lie algebra sl_2.
For a discriminantal arrangement in C^k, the skew-symmetric cohomology is
nontrivial in dimension k-1 precisely when the ""master function"" which defines
the local system on the complement has nonisolated critical points. In
symmetric coordinates, the critical set is a union of lines. Generically, the
dimension of this nontrivial skew-symmetric cohomology group is equal to the
number of critical lines.

measured in the region where additional pion production is kinematically
forbidden. The experiment was performed at ITEP PS at incident pi- kinetic
energies T_0= 0.59, 0.75 and 1.1 GeV. The integrated forward differential cross
section was found to decrease with energy slowly. At 1.1 GeV it exceeds the
theoretical prediction within the conventional sequential single charge
exchange mechanism with a neutral pion in the intermediate state (Glauber
elastic rescattering) by about half an order of magnitude. The sequential
mechanism with two pions in the intermediate state (Glauber inelastic
rescatterings), which was proposed recently, seems to be able to explain the
observed slow energy dependence and allows to predict the DCX cross section for
higher energies.

motion is reduced to the solution for a set of two coupled, linear partial
differential equations for the electromagnetic field. These equations are
completely solved when the magnetic field is produced by a fixed magnetic
monopole. The result is applied to central electric field cases, in particular
to the time-dependent monopole-oscillator problem. As an additional example of
the theory, we found all Noether point symmetries and invariants for a constant
magnetic field and a time-dependent harmonic electric field with a forcing
term.
