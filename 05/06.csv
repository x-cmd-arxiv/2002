matter halo approach to describe the nonlinear gravitational evolution of
structure in the universe. Since the third-order moment of the shear field
vanishes because of symmetry, non-Gaussian signatures in its one-point
statistics emerge at the fourth-order level. We argue that the shear kurtosis
parameter S_4 = <gamma^4>/<gamma^2>^3 may be more directly applicable to
realistic data than the well-studied higher-order statistics of the convergence
field, since obtaining the convergence requires a non-local reconstruction from
the measured shear field.
  We compare our halo model predictions for the variance, skewness and kurtosis
of lensing fields with ray-tracing simulations of cold dark matter models and
find good agreement. The shear kurtosis calculation is made tractable by
developing approximations for fast and accurate evaluations of the
8-dimensional integrals needed to obtain the kurtosis. We show that on small
scales it is dominated by correlations within halos more massive than 10^14
solar masses. The shear kurtosis is sensitive to the mass density parameter of
the universe, Omega, and has relatively weak dependences on other parameters.
The approximations we develop for the third- and fourth-order moments allow for
accurate halo model predictions for the 3-dimensional mass distribution as
well. We demonstrate their accuracy in the small scale regime, below 2 Mpc,
where analytical approaches used in the literature so far cease to be accurate.

effectively a one dimensional Lagrangian model and it can be evolved
numerically much faster that the conventional 3D models. A self-consistent
derivation of the dynamical equations of the model is performed and several
important theorems about the dynamics of the model are proved without any
particular assumption about the equation of state of the stellar gas. The
dynamical equations are solved numerically for the case of $n=1.5$ polytropic
star evolving in the relativistic field of a $10^7M_{\odot}$ Kerr black hole.
Some results of these calculations are compared with the results of
calculations based on finite-difference 3D simulations. The comparison shows a
very good agreement between both approaches to the problem. Then we show that
the strength of the tidal encounter depends significantly on the relative
orientation of the orbital angular momentum of the star and the spin of the

uncertainties of +/- 0.2. Four sources have flatter profiles, either due to
asymmetries or to the presence of an outer constant density region. No
significant difference is found between class 0 and I sources. The power-law
fits fail for the pre-stellar cores, supporting recent results that such cores
do not have a central source of heating. The derived physical models are used

is found that class I objects typically show CO abundances close to those found

lower abundances by almost an order of magnitude implying that significant
depletion occurs for the early phases of star formation. While the 2-1 and 3-2

throughout the envelope, the 1-0 lines are significantly underestimated,
possibly due to contribution of ambient molecular cloud material to the

galaxies have young stellar populations, low surface mass densities and the low
concentrations typical of disks. A significant fraction of the lowest mass
galaxies in our sample have experienced recent starbursts. At given stellar
mass, the sizes of low mass galaxies are log- normally distributed with
dispersion sigma(ln R_50) \sim 0.5, in excellent agreement with the idea that
they form with little angular momentum loss through cooling and condensation in
a gravitationally dominant dark matter halo. Their median stellar surface mass
density scales with stellar mass as mu* propto M_*^0.54, suggesting that the
stellar mass of a disk galaxy is proprtional to the three halves power of its
halo mass. This suggests that the efficiency of the conversion of baryons into
stars in low mass galaxies increases in propor- tion to halo mass, perhaps as a
result of supernova feedback processes. At stellar masses above 3 \times 10^10
M_sol, there is a rapidly increasing frac- tion of galaxies with old stellar
populations, high surface mass densities and high concentrations typical of
bulges. In this regime, the size distribution is log-normal, but its dispersion
decreases rapidly with increasing stellar mass and the median mass surface
density is approximately constant. This suggests that the star formation
efficiency decreases in the highest mass halos, and that little star formation
occurs in massive galaxies once they have assembled.

spanning the whole Hubble sequence, and with m_p<=16 (M_p<=-15). These data
were combined to obtain galaxy SEDs extending from 2000 to 22000 A. By fitting
these SEDs with synthetic ones derived using Bruzual & Charlot population
synthesis models we try to constrain observationally the SFH of these galaxies.
Assuming a Salpeter IMF and an analytical form for the SFH, the fit free
parameters are: the age (T) of the star formation event, its characteristic
time-scale (tau) and the initial metallicity (Z). We test the (simplistic) case
where all galaxies have a common age T=13 Gyr, exploring a SFH with ""delayed""
exponential form, thus allowing for an increasing SFR with time. This SFH is
consistent with the full range of observed SEDs, provided that the
characteristic time-scale tau is let free to vary between 0.1 and 25 Gyr and Z
between 1/5 and 2.5 Z solar. Elliptical galaxies (including dEs) are best
fitted with short time scales (tau~3 Gyr) and Z varying between 1/5 and 1 Z
solar. The model metallicity is found to increase with H band luminosity.
Spiral galaxies require that both tau and Z correlate with H band luminosity:
low mass Im+BCD have sub-solar Z and tau>=10 Gyr, whereas giant spirals have
solar metallicities and tau~3 Gyr, consistent with ellipticals. Moreover we
find that the SFH of spirals depends upon the presence at their interior of
fresh gas capable of sustaining the star formation. In fact the residuals of
the tau vs. L_H relation depend significantly on the HI content. HI deficient
galaxies have shorter tau than spirals with normal HI content.

facilitated in more compact stars and more massive stars. Therefore accretion
of mass by pulsars in binary systems may allow pair production in most of the

be important in millisecond pulsars if their surface temperatures are above

their primary acceleration limited by the effect of screening of the electric

pulsars that produce pairs only through inverse-Compton emission will not be

response to the application of a vertical overload localized at its top

random number per grain in the calculation of the contact forces. The so-called
`multi-agent' technique we use, lets us deal with systems as large as
$1000\times1000$ grains. We show that the average response profile has a double
peaked structure. At large depth $z$, the position of these peaks grows with
$cz$, while their widths scales like $\sqrt{Dz}$. $c$ and $D$ are analogous to
`propagation' and `diffusion' coefficients. Their values depend on that of the
friction coefficient $\mu$. At small $\mu$, we get $c_0-c \propto \mu$ and $D
\propto \mu^\beta$, with $\beta \sim 2.5$, which means that the peaks get
closer and wider as the disorder gets larger. This behavior is qualitatively
what was predicted in a model where a stochastic relation between the stress

the uncorrelated limit U=0 is associated with the super-symmetric point

spacetime is assumed to be stationary and asymptotically flat, but no other
symmetries are imposed -- the spacetime can rotate and deviate strongly from
spherical symmetry. We prove that the late-time behavior of the scalar field is
identical to what it would be in a spherically-symmetric spacetime: it decays
in time according to an inverse power-law, with a power determined by the
angular profile of the initial wave packet (Price falloff theorem). The field's
late-time dynamics is insensitive to the nonspherical aspects of the metric,
and it is governed entirely by the spacetime's total gravitational mass; other
multipole moments, and in particular the spacetime's total angular momentum, do
not enter in the description of the field's late-time behavior. This extended
formulation of Price's falloff theorem appears to be at odds with previous
studies of radiative decay in the spacetime of a Kerr black hole. We show,
however, that the contradiction is only apparent, and that it is largely an
artifact of the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates adopted in these studies.

In addition, we prove that the effect of this extended Wick transform is
equivalent to a constant scale transformation as far as the symplectic
structure and kinematical constraints are concerned. This equivalence is broken
in the dynamical evolution. Our results are applied to the discussion of the
black hole entropy in the limit of large horizon areas. We first argue that,
since the entropy calculation is performed for horizons of fixed constant area,
one might in principle choose an Immirzi parameter that depends on this
quantity. This would spoil the linearity with the area in the entropy formula.
We then show that the Immirzi parameter appears as a constant scaling in all
the steps where dynamical information plays a relevant role in the entropy
calculation. This fact, together with the kinematical equivalence of the
Immirzi ambiguity with a change of scale, is used to preclude the potential
non-linearity of the entropy on physical grounds.

cosmologically interesting parameter regions, which have not attracted much
attention so far. We have also investigated the prospects of direct and
indirect detection of these dark matter candidates, and found that there is an
intriguing possibility to detect them in various next generation dark matter
searches.

  another), results are discussed in Chap. 4",,,,"hep-ph",,"  This dissertation reviews the Standard Model formalism as well as the Lepton
Flavour Violating (LFV) decay processes which cause its extension, known as the
physics beyond the SM. Firstly, using the experimental bounds on three body LFV
decays, the corresponding bounds on two body LFV decays are reviewed. The
dynamical suppression of three body LFV decays due to momentum dependent
couplings is also reviewed. Secondly, the role of the LFV decays to explain the
LSND excess is discussed in detail, for which the experimental bounds on three
body LFV decays, i.e. \mu -> 3e are used to constraint the coupling
\tilde{g}_{Z_{\mu e}}, which is needed to calculate the anomalous muon decay
\mu -> e\nu_l\bar{\nu}_l. Then comparing the effective coupling of anomalous
muon decay to r>1.6\times 10^{-3} [9809524], it is proved that LFV is not the
correct hypothesis to explain the LSND excess. Finally, LFV decays at loop
order are studied in Seesaw model of neutrino masses [PRL. 86 2502 (2001)]
where the smallness of the Seesaw neutrino mass may be naturally realized with
m_N (mass of right-handed singlet neutrinos) of order 1 TeV. It is shown that
the Higgs mass of a new scalar doublet with lepton number L=-1 needed in the
model has to be larger than 50 TeV to get the branching ratio of \mu -> 3e to
be consistent with the existing bound on \mu -> 3e. This defeats the original
motivation of the model, namely that there is no physics beyond the TeV energy
scale.

condition that the values of the scalar field on the respective branes cannot
fluctuate due to its extremely narrow brane potentials. We call this case the
strong coupling limit. Our concern in this paper is to generalize our previous
analysis relaxing the limitation of taking the strong coupling limit. We find
that new corrections in metric perturbations due to relaxing the strong
coupling limit enhance the deviation from the 4D Einstein gravity only in some
exceptional cases. In the case that matter fields reside on the negative
tension brane, the stabilized radion mass becomes very small when the new

at 40, 80 and 158 AGeV are presented. These are compared with data at lower and
higher energies as well as with results from p+p interactions. The mean pion
multiplicity per wounded nucleon increases approximately linearly with s_NN^1/4
with a change of slope starting in the region 15-40 AGeV. The change from pion
suppression with respect to p+p interactions, as observed at low collision
energies, to pion enhancement at high energies occurs at about 40 AGeV. A
non-monotonic energy dependence of the ratio of K^+ to pi^+ yields is observed,
with a maximum close to 40 AGeV and an indication of a nearly constant value at
higher energies.The measured dependences may be related to an increase of the
entropy production and a decrease of the strangeness to entropy ratio in
central Pb+Pb collisions in the low SPS energy range, which is consistent with
the hypothesis that a transient state of deconfined matter is created above
these energies. Other interpretations of the data are also discussed.

nuclei is analyzed with a Finite Range Density Dependent interaction in the Sn

variation after particle number projection method. We find that whereas all
approaches succeed rather well in the description of the total energy they
differ significantly in the pairing correlation content of the wave functions.
The description of the evolution from the weak to the strong pairing regime is
also approach dependent, specially at shell closure.

nuclei-nuclei collisions. The isotopic invariance of the strong interaction and
the selection rules due to P-parity and total angular momentum result in a
general and model independent parametrization of the spin structure of the
matrix element in terms of three partial amplitudes. In the framework of
one-pion exchange model these amplitudes can be derived in terms of the two
threshold partial amplitudes for the process $\pi+N\to N+\phi$. We predict the
ratio of cross sections for $\phi-$meson production in $pp$- and $\Delta
N$-collisions and the polarization properties of the $\phi$-meson, in
$\Delta+N\to N+N+\phi$, as a function of a single parameter, which
characterizes the relative role of transversal and longitudinal $\phi$-meson
polarizations in the process $\pi+N\to N+\phi$.

string-like. This nature of particles has caused the divergence difficulties in
quantum field, string and superstring theories. In the framework of special
relativity, due to the non-uniformity of the m-space and phase space in the
usual inertial coordinate system, Boltzmann's hypothesis of the equality of the
probability of equal volume element is no longer appropriate. That makes it
very difficult to construct Lorentz-invariant statistical mechanics and
thermodynamics for many-particle systems. Besides, some observations on special
relativity itself and its experimental facts are also reported. The conclusions
from these observations are: Special relativity is not an ultimate theory; Some
modification is needed; Any modification must not violate the constancy of the
light speed and the local Lorentz invariance; It seems that we have to change
the assumption on local structures of gravity-free space and time in special
relativity.

arguments in favour of local realism. Moreover, our frequency analysis supports
the original EPR-idea that quantum mechnaics is not complete.
