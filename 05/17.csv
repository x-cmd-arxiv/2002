in several quasar absorption systems, and the complementary determination of
the cosmological baryon density by observations of anisotropies in the cosmic
microwave background (CMB), allow for a reevaluation of the constraints on the
relativistic particle content of the universe at primordial nucleosynthesis.
Expressed in terms of the neutrino energy density, we find 1.7 < N_\nu < 3.5
(95% CL). In particular, we show that phenomenological four neutrino models
including a sterile state (not participating in SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y interactions)
unavoidably thermalize a fourth neutrino, and are highly disfavored in the
standard minimal model of primordial nucleosynthesis, if the systematic
uncertainty in the primordial helium abundance is small. We describe plausible
extensions of the minimal model which evade this constraint.

strong intrinsic magnetic field. We point out that despite many claims actually
there is no real evidence for the ``Event Horizon'' (EH) of supposed BHs and on

suggest that the two orbits are nearly co-planar and are trapped in an apsidal
resonance in which the difference between their longitudes of periastron
undergoes a bounded oscillation about 0 degrees. Here we elucidate the origin
of these large eccentricities and of the apsidal alignment. Resonant
interactions between a remnant circumstellar disk of gas lying exterior to the
orbits of both planets can smoothly grow e2. Secular interactions between
planets D and C can siphon off the eccentricity of the former to grow that of
the latter. Externally amplifying e2 during the phase of the apsidal
oscillation when e2/e1 is smallest drives the oscillation amplitude towards
zero. Thus, the substantial eccentricity of planet C and the locking of orbital
apsides are both consequences of externally pumping the eccentricity of planet
D over timescales exceeding apsidal precession periods of order 1e4 yr. We
explain why the recently detected stellar companion to Upsilon Andromedae is
largely dynamically decoupled from the planetary system.

two parts, according to the secular theory of test particle orbits. The first
part is a forced oscillation driven by the planets, while the second part is a
free oscillation whose amplitude is determined by the initial orbit of the test
particle. We extract the free orbital inclinations and free orbital
eccentricities from the osculating elements of 125 known CKBOs. The free
inclinations of 32 CKBOs strongly cluster about 2 degrees at orbital semi-major
axes between 44 and 45 AU. We propose that these objects comprise a collisional

plausibly the fragments of an ancient parent body having a minimum diameter of

concerning their origin: either from wind infall onto a putative degenerate
companion, as for typical Be/X-ray binaries, or from the Be star per se. Recent
progress has been made to address this: (1) the discovery that gamma Cas is an
eccentric binary system (P = 203.59 d) with unknown secondary type, (2) the
accumulation of RXTE data at 9 epochs in 1996-2000, and (3) the collation of
robotic telescope B, V-band photometric observations over 4 seasons. The latter
show a 3%, cyclical flux variation with cycle lengths 55-93 days. We find that
X-ray fluxes at all 9 epochs show random variations with orbital phase. This
contradicts the binary accretion model, which predicts a substantial
modulation. However,these fluxes correlate well with the cyclical optical
variations. Also, the 6 flux measurements in 2000 closely track the
interpolated optical variations between the 2000 and 2001 observing seasons.
Since the optical variations represent a far greater energy than that emitted
as X-rays, the optical variability cannot arise from X-ray reprocessing.
However, the strong correlation between the two suggests that they are driven
by a common mechanism. We propose that this mechanism is a cyclical magnetic
dynamo excited by a Balbus-Hawley instability located within the inner part of
the circumstellar disk. In our model, variations in the field strength directly
produce the changes in the magnetically related X-ray activity. Turbulence
associated with the dynamo results in changes to the density distribution

medium. It has been known for decades that turbulent drag is an efficient way
to induce grain relative motions. However, earlier treatments disregarded
magnetic field and used Kolmogorov turbulence. Unlike hydro turbulence, MHD
turbulence is anisotropic on small scales. Moreover, compressible modes are
important for MHD and magnetic perturbations can directly interact with grains.
We provide calculations of grain relative motion for realistic interstellar
turbulence driving that is consistent with the velocity dispersions observed in
diffuse gas and for realistic grain charging. We account for the turbulence
cutoff arising from abmipolar drag. Our results on grain shattering are
consistent with the customary accepted cutoff size. We obtain grain velocities
for turbulence with parameters consistent with those in HI and dark clouds.
These velocities are smaller than those in earlier papers, where MHD effects
were disregarded. Finally, we consider grain velocities arising from
photoelectric emission, radiation pressure and the thrust due to molecular
hydrogen formation. These are lower than relative velocities induced by
turbulence. We conclude that turbulence should prevent these mechanisms from
segregating grains by size.

take into account the converging geometry of lines of sight for the
observations when the observer is within the turbulent volume. Assuming that
the intensity of turbulence changes along the line of sight, we get a
reasonable fit to the observed synchrotron data. As for the spectra of
polarized starlight we get a good fit to the observations taking into account
the fact that the observational sample is biased toward nearby stars.

by both observations and numerical simulations. We review recent progress in
studies of both incompressible and compressible turbulence. We compare
Iroshnikov-Kraichnan and Goldreich-Sridhar models, and discuss scalings of
Alfv\'en, slow, and fast waves. We also discuss the completely new regime of
MHD turbulence that happens below the scale at which hydrodynamic turbulent
motions are damped by viscosity. In the case of the partially ionized diffuse
interstellar gas the viscosity is due to neutrals and truncates the turbulent
cascade at $\sim$parsec scales. We show that below this scale magnetic
fluctuations with a shallow spectrum persist and discuss the possibility of a
resumption of the MHD cascade after ions and neutrals decouple. We discuss the
implications of this new insight into MHD turbulence for cosmic ray transport,
grain dynamics, etc., and how to test theoretical predictions against

The spectral energy distribution of the progenitor resembles an under-luminous
F main sequence star (at V=15.6 mag), that erupted into a cool supergiant
following a complex and multi-maxima lightcurve (peaking at V=6.7 mag). The
outburst spectrum show BaII, LiI and lines of several s-elements, with wide
P-Cyg profiles and a moderate and retracing emission in the Balmer lines. A
light-echo discovered expanding around the object helped to constrain the
distance (d=790+/-30 pc), providing M_V=+4.45 in quiescence and M_V=-4.35 at
optical maximum (somewhat dependent on the still uncertain E(B-V)=0.5
reddening). The general outburst trend is toward lower temperatures and larger
luminosities, and continuing so at the time of writing. The object properties
conflict with a classification within already existing categories: the
progenitor was not on a post-AGB track and thus the similarities with the
born-again AGB stars FG Sge, V605 Aql and Sakurai's object are limited to the
cool giant spectrum at maximum; the cool spectrum, the moderate wind velocity
(500 km/sec and progressively reducing) and the monotonic decreasing of the low
ionization condition argues against a classical nova scenario. The closest
similarity is with a star that erupted into an M-type supergiant discovered in
M31 by Rich et al. (1989), that became however much brighter by peaking at
M_V=-9.95, and with V4332 Sgr that too erupted into an M-type giant (Martini et
al. 1999) and that attained a lower luminosity, closer to that of V838 Mon.
M31-RedVar, V4332 Sgr and V838 Mon could be manifestations of the same and new

when obtaining best-fitting halo parameters for the lens galaxies can lead to
an overestimate by a factor of order 2 for the halo mass interior to a radius
of 100 kpc/h. We also show that multiple weak deflections create systematic
effects which may hinder observational efforts to use weak lensing to constrain
the projected shapes of the halos of field galaxies. For a data set in which
the galaxies have magnitudes in the rage 19 < I < 23, multiple deflections
result in strong correlations between the post-lensing image shapes of most
foreground-background pairs of galaxies. Imposing a simple redshift cut during
the data anaysis is sufficient to reduce the correlation between the final
images of lenses and sources to the point that the expected anisotropy in the
weak lensing signal can be detected via a straightforward average. We conclude

it is possible to replace a random rough surface by effective stick-slip
boundary conditions on a flat surface with two constants: the stick-slip length
and the renormalization of viscosity near the boundary. The stick-slip length
and the renormalization coefficient are expressed explicitly via the
correlation function of random surface inhomogeneities. The effective
stick-slip length is always negative signifying the effective slow-down of the
hydrodynamic flows by the rough surface (stick rather than slip motion). A
simple hydrodynamic model is presented as an illustration of these general
hydrodynamic results. The effective boundary parameters are analyzed

behavior of all the four series of manganates is similar, with some of the
properties showing dependence on the average radius of the A-site cations, <rA>
and cation size disorder. Thus, all the compositions show increase in
magnetization at 100-120 K (TM) for x<xmax, the magnetization increasing with
increasing x. The value of xmax increases with decreasing <rA>, probably due to
the increased phase separation induced by site disorder. This is also reflected
in the larger width of the hysteresis loops at T<TM for small x or <rA>. In
this regime, the electrical resistivity decreases with increasing x, but
remains low and nearly constant T>TM. The percolative nature of the conduction
mechanism at T<TM is substantiated by the fit of the conductivity data to the
scaling law, s \mu |xc-x|p where p is in the 2-4 range. When x>xmax, the
materials become antiferromagnetic and charge-ordered at a temperature TCA,
accompanied by a marked increase in resistivity. The value of TCA increases
with increase in <rA> and x (upto x=0.3). Thus, all the four series of
manganates are characterized by a phase-separated regime between x=0.02 and
0.1-0.15 and an antiferromagnetic charge-ordered regime at x>0.1-0.15.

$p$-type quantum wells. These rates are used to derive the temperature
dependence of the weak-localization correction to the conductivity. In $p$-type
quantum wells both weak localization and weak anti-localization are present due
to the strong spin-orbit interaction. When determining the total conductivity
correction one also have to include the term due to hole-hole interaction. The
magnitude of the latter depends on the ratio between the thermal energy and the
Fermi energy, $k_{\rm B}T/E_{\rm F}$ and whether the system can be considered
as ballistic $(k_{\rm B}T \tau_{\rm tr} / \hbar>1)$ or diffusive ($k_{\rm B}T
\tau_{\rm tr}/\hbar<1$). We argue that due to the relatively low Fermi energy
and the moderate mobilities, in the $p$-type systems in question, the
conductivity correction arising from hole-hole interactions is negligible at
the highest temperatures accessible in the experiments. Hence the
'metal-insulator' transition observed at these relatively high temperatures
could be caused by interference effects. We compare our calculations of the
weak anti-localization correction with the experimental results from different
independent groups with special emphasis on the experiments by Simmons et al.

many superheavy fields whose mass scales are below the unification scale, this
mechanism explains this fact by means of one-loop renormalization group
equations. Since the unification scale generically becomes below the usual GUT
scale, $2\times 10^{16}$ GeV, and proton decay via dimension 5 operators is
suppressed, the scenario predicts that proton decay via dimension 6 operators,
$p\to e \pi^0$, will be observed in the near future. In this paper, we attempt
to estimate a reasonable range of values of the lifetime of the proton
predicted within this scenario by using a two-loop renormalization group

three spatial and three curvature dimensions, intrinsic to the partitioned
string, are necessary to replicate Standard Model particles and interactions.
This analysis has established that particulate mass is determined by a
functional relationship involving these six extra dimensions. The combinatorial
analysis involves non-commutative 3D-matrix algebra which forms the
mathematical underpinnings of Dirac notation. The functional relationship
(symbolized by Beth) requires exponential, Randall-Sundrum, scaling to compute
mass. Through the proper interpretation of complex gravity a cyclic
cosmological model is developed. This formulation of cyclic cosmology
inherently involves observed dark energy. Thus, a comprehensive theory is
constructed from geometric fundamentals which models both massive, oscillating

crossed magnetic and electric fields is under investigation. Since it is
assumed that an impurity center interacts as an attractive $\delta$-like
potential a renormalization procedure for the retarded Green's function has to
be carried out. For the vanishing electric field we obtain a close analytical
expression for the Green's function and we find one bound state localized
between Landau levels. It is also shown by numerical investigations that
switching on the electric field new long-living resonance states localized in
the vicinity of Landau levels can be generated.

phenomena from the macroworld. The loss of coherence between superposed wave
packets depends on their separation. The precise temporal course depends on the
relative size of the time scales for decoherence and other processes taking
place in the open system and its environment. We use the exactly solvable model
of an harmonic oscillator coupled to a bath of oscillators to illustrate
various decoherence scenarios: These range from exponential golden-rule decay
for microscopic superpositions, system-specific decay for larger separations in
a crossover regime, and finally universal interaction-dominated decoherence for
ever more macroscopic superpositions.

switch, related to the ``$c$-$\phi $'' gate of quantum computation. This gate
relies on quantum interference between photon pairs, generating entanglement
between two optical modes through the process of spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC). The interference effect serves to enhance the effective
nonlinearity by many orders of magnitude, so it is significant at the quantum
(single-photon) level. By adjusting the relative optical phase between the
classical pump for SPDC and the pair of input modes, one can impress a large
phase shift on one beam which depends on the presence or absence of a single
photon in a control mode.
