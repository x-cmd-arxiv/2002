black holes (BHs) with masses in excess of 10^9 Msun have already assembled at
a very early stage in the evolution of the universe. An alternative
interpretation is that these quasars are powered by less massive BHs, but their
fluxes are strongly magnified through gravitational lensing by intervening
galaxies. Here we analyze the flux distribution of the Ly alpha emission of the
quasar with the highest known redshift, SDSS 1030+0524, at z=6.28. We show that
this object could not have been magnified by lensing by more than a factor of
five. The constraint arises from the large observed size, 30 (comoving) Mpc, of
the ionized region around this quasar, and relies crucially only on the
assumption that the quasar is embedded in a largely neutral IGM. Based on the
line/continuum ratio of SDSS 1030+0524, we argue further that this quasar also
cannot be beamed by a significant factor. We conclude that the minimum mass for
its resident BH is 4 x 10^8 Msun (for magnification by a factor of five); if
the mass is this low, then the quasars had to switch on prior to redshift z=9.

effects. These include anomalies caused by the excess of observers in the
northern as against the southern hemisphere, seasonal and diurnal biases,
directional effects which make it harder to discover comets in certain regions
of the sky, as well as sociological biases. The stream proposed by Murray is
shown on an equal area Hammer-Aitoff projection. The addition of newer data
weakens the case for the alignment. There is also evidence that the subsample
in the stream is affected by seasonal and north-south biases. The stream
proposed by Matese et al. is most obvious in the sample of dynamically new
comets, and especially in those whose orbits are best known. The most recent
data continues to maintain the overpopulation in this great circle. This
pattern in the data occurs about once in a thousand times by chance. Numerical
integrations are used to demonstrate that a planet by itself can reduce the
perihelia of comets in its orbital plane to sufficiently small values so that
they could be discovered from the Earth. There is a need for a sample of long

envelope prior to going to die as white dwarf stars. Although the duration of
this phase is short (e.g., $\sim 10^5$ yr), such evolved stars could contribute
both to the ionization of gas in galaxies and to the production of a lot of

from high to low frequencies in agreement with the behavior observed

correlations are stronger. It was also observed that the inverse of the Drude

polarization reversal when a strong electric field was applied and
back-switching after the field was removed. We show how these processes are
related to the underlying structure of domain walls, which in turn is
controlled by the pinning at quenched local electric fields.
  When the depolarization fields of bound charges are properly screened we find
that the fractal switching current noise may appear with two distinct universal
behaviors. The critical depinning of plane domain walls determines the
universality class in the case of weak random fields, whereas for large
randomness the massive nucleation of domains in the bulk leads to different
scaling properties.
  In both cases the scaling exponents decay logarithmically when the driving
frequency is increased. The polarization reverses in the applied field as a
power-law, while its relaxation in zero field is a stretch exponential function
of time. The stretching exponent depends on the strength of pinning. The
results may be applicable for uniaxial relaxor ferroelectrics, such as doped

Klein-Gordon field. Our code uses a dual-null formulation for spherically
symmetric space-time integration, and the numerical range covers both universes
connected by the wormhole. We observe that the wormhole is unstable against
Gaussian pulses in either exotic or normal massless Klein-Gordon fields. The
wormhole throat suffers a bifurcation of horizons and either explodes to form
an inflationary universe or collapses to a black hole, if the total input
energy is respectively negative or positive. As the perturbations become small
in total energy, there is evidence for critical solutions with a certain
black-hole mass or Hubble constant. The collapse time is related to the initial
energy with an apparently universal critical exponent. For normal matter, such
as a traveller traversing the wormhole, collapse to a black hole always
results. However, carefully balanced additional ghost radiation can maintain
the wormhole for a limited time. The black-hole formation from a traversible
wormhole confirms the recently proposed duality between them. The inflationary
case provides a mechanism for inflating, to macroscopic size, a Planck-sized
wormhole formed in space-time foam.

converted into the observed small baryon asymmetry by virtue of sphaleron

of the Leibniz rule. We analyze this issue by using the Wess-Zumino model and a

We point out that the Leibniz rule could be maintained on the lattice if the
generic momentum $k_{\mu}$ carried by any field variable satisfies
$|ak_{\mu}|<\delta$ in the limit $a\to 0$ for arbitrarily small but finite
$\delta$. This condition is expected to be satisfied generally if the theory is
finite perturbatively, provided that discretization does not induce further
symmetry breaking. We thus first render the continuum Wess-Zumino model finite
by applying the higher derivative regularization which preserves supersymmetry.
We then put this theory on the lattice, which preserves supersymmetry except
for a breaking in interaction terms by the failure of the Leibniz rule. By this
way, we define a lattice Wess-Zumino model which maintains the basic properties
such as $U(1)\times U(1)_{R}$ symmetry and holomorphicity. We show that this
model reproduces continuum theory in the limit $a\to 0$ up to any finite order
in perturbation theory; in this sense all the supersymmetry breaking terms
induced by the failure of the Leibniz rule are irrelevant. We then suggest that
this discretization may work to define a low energy effective theory in a
non-perturbative way.

spatiotemporal systems, such as coupled circle map lattices, commonly yields
multiple co-existing attractors, giving rise to phenomena strongly dependent on
the initial lattice. By marked contrast numerical evidence here strongly
indicates that asynchronous evolution eliminates most of the attractor states
arising from special sets of initial conditions in synchronous systems, and
tends to yield more global attractors. Thus the phenomenology arising from
asynchronous evolution is more generic and robust in that it is obtained from
many different classes of initial states. Further we show that in parameter
regions where both asynchronous and synchronous evolution yield spatio-temporal
intermittency, asynchronicity leads to better scaling behaviour.

would like to understand if there are some general principles that govern the
structure and dynamics of the neural circuits that underlie these phenomena. At
the molecular level there is an extraordinary universality, but these
mechanisms are surprisingly complex. This raises the question of how the brain
selects from these diverse mechanisms and adapts to compute ""the right thing""
in each context. One approach is to ask what problems the brain really solves.
There are several examples - from the ability of the visual system to count
photons on a dark night to our gestalt recognition of statistical tendencies
toward symmetry in random patterns - where the performance of the system in
fact approaches some fundamental physical or statistical limits. This suggests
that some sort of optimization principles may be at work, and there are
examples where these principles have been formulated clearly and generated
predictions which are confirmed in new experiments; a central theme in this
work is the matching of the coding and computational strategies of the brain to
the statistical structure of the world around us. Extension of these principles
to the problem of learning leads us into interesting theoretical questions
about how to measure the complexity of the data from which we learn and the
complexity of the models that we use in learning, as well as opening some new
opportunities for experiment. This combination of theoretical and experimental
work gives us some new (if still speculative) perspectives on classical
problems and controversies in cognition.

reformulates and extends standard quantum theory. The proposed theory is
`realistic' in the sense that in it, a general M-level quantum state is
represented by a single real number r. Surprising as it may seem, this real
number is shown to contain the same probabilistic information as the standard
Hilbert-space state, plus additional information from which measurement outcome
is determined. A crucial concept in achieving this is that of Borelian
(number-theoretic) normality. The essential role of complex numbers in standard
quantum theory is subsumed by the action of a set of self-similar permutation
operators on the digits and places of the base-M expansion of a base-M
Borelian-normal r; these permutation operators are shown to have complex
structure and leave invariant the normality of the underlying real number. The
set of real numbers generated by these permutations defines not only the
Hilbert space of standard quantum theory, but also, in addition, the sample
space from which quantum measurement outcomes can be objectively determined.
Dynamical real-number state reduction is precisely described by deterministic
number-theoretic operators that reduce the degree of normality of r; from the
degree of normality one can infer the standard quantum-theoretic trace rule for
measurement probability. All the foundational difficulties of standard quantum
theory are described in terms of the proposed theory. It is shown that the
real-number states of the proposed theory are precisely its beables.
