consider the detectability of these levels of non--Gaussianity in the
bispectrum of the cosmic microwave background. We find that the levels of
non--Gaussianity for warm and supercooled inflation are comparable, and
over--ridden by the contribution to the bispectrum due to other physical
effects. We also conclude that the resulting bispectrum values will be
undetectable in the cosmic microwave background for both the MAP and Planck

This feature, which represents the first jet-like component ever detected in

the same position angle as the jet in the radio and X-ray images. We propose
two different scenarios for the origin of the emission: i) non-thermal
synchrotron from a mildly relativistic component of the jet; ii) scattered
light from the nucleus, where a BL Lac source may be hosted. Either of these
pictures would have important consequences for the AGN unification schemes and
for our knowledge of the jet structure. In the Chandra image a faint
counter-jet is also present. From a comparative analysis of the HST images and

The obscuring structure might well reside in the geometrically thin dark disk
observed on large scales. This fits the scenario in which a standard
geometrically and optically thick torus is not present in FR I radio galaxies.

eclipsing X-ray binary X1822-371. We used new eclipse timings to derive a
revised optical ephemeris. A quadratic fit to the eclipse timings is not
statistically significant but suggests that the orbital period is increasing on
a timescale of P/|Pdot|= (4.2 +/- 1.4) 10^6 yr. We find no systematic delay or
advance of the optical timings with respect to the X-ray timings. Average UBVRI
light curves show the deep eclipse of the disc by the secondary star
superimposed on the broader and shallower occultation of the inner disc regions
by the outer disc (dip), and an orbital hump centred at phase +0.25 which is
mostly seen in the U and B bands. The starting phase of the dip occurs earlier
for shorter wavelengths, while the egress occurs at the same phase in all
bands. This suggests that the thickening of the outer, occulting disc rim is
gradual with azimuth at ingress but decreases sharply at egress. We fit
synthetic photometry to the extracted colors of the inner and outer disc
regions to estimate their effective temperatures. We find Teff= (9+/-5) 10^7 K
and Teff= (6+/-2) 10^4 K, respectively, for the inner and outer disc regions.
The orbital dependency of the flickering activity is derived from the mean
scatter of the individual light curves with respect to the average UBVRI light
curves. The flickering curves show a broad eclipse at the dipping phases, the
depth of which decreases with increasing wavelength. The blue, eclipsed
flickering component is associated with the inner disc regions and can be
fitted by a blackbody spectrum of Teff= (2.1+/-0.8) 10^8 K, whereas the
uneclipsed flickering component probably arises from the outermost disc regions
and is well described by a blackbody of Teff= (9.6+/-0.7) 10^3 K.

$T_{KT}$(Kosterlitz-Thouless transition), both the in-plane ($S^{xx}$) and the
out-of-plane ($S^{zz}$) components of $S({\bf q},\omega)$ exhibit very strong
and sharp spin-wave peaks. Well above $T_{KT}$, $S^{xx}$ and $S^{zz}$
apparently display a central peak, and spin-wave signatures are still seen in
$S^{zz}$. In addition, we also observed an almost dispersionless domain-wall
peak at high $\omega$ below $T_{c}$(Ising transition), where long-range order
appears in the staggered chirality. Above $T_{c}$, the domain-wall peak
disappears for all $q$. The lineshape of these peaks is captured reasonably
well by a Lorentzian form. Using a dynamic finite-size scaling theory, we
determined the dynamic critical exponent $z$ = 1.002(3). We found that our

equivalent to and motivates the form of a standard reduction that reproduces
light front, time ordered perturbation theory for bound states. We use this
three-dimensional light front formalism to compute electromagnetic form factors
between bound states to show how higher, light front Fock components arise from
the covariant Bethe-Salpeter wave function. Moreover, we show that non-wave
function vertices, which arise after integration over the minus momenta, are
completely removed in favor of higher Fock states when one correctly takes into
account all contributions at a given order in perturbation theory. Such
non-wave function vertices are shown only to occur in models in which the
interactions are instantaneous. These models lack true higher Fock states. The
normalization of the reduced wave function is derived from the covariant
framework and related to nonvalence probabilities using familiar Fock space
projection operators. Using a simple model, we obtain expressions for
generalized parton distributions that are continuous. The nonvanishing of these
distributions at the crossover between kinematic regimes (where the plus
component of the struck quark's momentum is equal to the plus component of the
momentum transfer) is tied to higher Fock components. Lastly we apply the light

non-trivial horizon topologies. We point out that this is a more serious
problem than it may at first seem, for it cannot be resolved even by taking
into account the effect of the branes on the geometry of spacetime. [It is
ultimately due to the {\em topology} of spacetime, not its geometry.] Next,
assuming the validity of some kind of dS/CFT correspondence, we argue that
asymptotically deSitter versions of the Hull-Strominger-Gutperle S-brane
spacetimes are also unstable in this ""topological"" sense, at least in the case
where the R-symmetries are preserved. We conjecture that this is due to the
unrestrained creation of ""late"" branes, the spacelike analogue of large branes,
at very late cosmological times.

high-throughput technique for measuring mRNA expression levels, quantitative
calibration studies have until now been limited. The main reason is that
suitable data was not available. However, calibration data recently produced by
Affymetrix now permits detailed studies of the intensity dependent sensitivity.
Given a certain transcript concentration, it is of particular interest to know
whether current analysis methods are capable of detecting differential
expression ratios of 2 or higher. Using the calibration data, we demonstrate
that while current techniques are capable of detecting changes in the low to
mid concentration range, the situation is noticeably worse for high
concentrations. In this regime, expression changes as large as 4 fold are
severely biased, and changes of 2 are often undetectable. Such effects are
mainly the consequence of the sequence specific binding properties of probes,
and not the result of optical saturation in the fluorescence measurements.
GeneChips are manufactured such that each transcript is probed by a set of
sequences with a wide affinity range. We show that this property can be used to
design a method capable of reducing the high intensity bias. The idea behind
our methods is to transfers the weight of a measurement to a subset of probes
with optimal linear response at a given concentration, which can be achieved
using local embedding techniques.

Theorem and demonstrate how the Bayesian methodology makes explicit the
underlying assumptions. We then further demonstrate the power of the Bayesian
approach by deriving two separation algorithms that incorporate additional
prior information. One algorithm separates signals that are known a priori to

  Rate Quantum Channel","4 pages, with a new analytical result, to appear in PRA",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A secret key shared through quantum key distribution between two cooperative
players is secure against any eavesdropping attack allowed by the laws of
physics. Yet, such a key can be established only when the quantum channel error
rate due to eavesdropping or imperfect apparatus is low. Here, I report a
practical quantum key distribution scheme making use of an adaptive privacy
amplification procedure with two-way classical communication. Then, I prove
that the scheme generates a secret key whenever the bit error rate of the
quantum channel is less than $0.5-0.1\sqrt{5} \approx 27.6%$, thereby making it
the most error resistant scheme known to date.

polarized photon states give a new idea about the vacuum concept in
electrodynamics.
