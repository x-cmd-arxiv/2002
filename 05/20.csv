that survive Silk damping on much smaller scales than compressional modes. This
ensures that there is no sharp cut-off in anisotropy on arc-minute scales. As
we had pointed out earlier, tangled magnetic fields, if they exist, will then
be a potentially important contributor to small-angular scale CMBR
anisotropies. Several ongoing and new experiments, are expected to probe the
very small angular scales, corresponding to multipoles with l>1000. In view of
this observational focus, we revisit the predicted signals due to primordial
tangled magnetic fields, for different spectra and different cosmological
parameters. We also identify a new regime, where the photon mean-free path
exceeds the scale of the perturbation, which dominates the predicted signal at
very high l. A scale-invariant spectrum of tangled fields which redshifts to a
present value B_{0}=3\times 10^{-9} Gauss, produces temperature anisotropies at
the 10 micro Kelvin level between l ~ 1000-3000. Larger signals result if the
univese is lambda dominated, if the baryon density is larger, or if the
spectral index of magnetic tangles is steeper, n > -3. The signal will also
have non-Gaussian statistics. We predict the distinctive form of the increased
power expected in the microwave background at high l in the presence of
significant tangled magnetic fields. We may be on the verge of detecting or
ruling out the presence of tangled magnetic fields which are strong enough to
influence the formation of large-scale structure in the Universe.

suggest that iron group elements are either produced in the gamma ray burst, or

then such material would be expected to be rich in Nickel-56. If the nickel
remains partially ionized, this prevents the electron capture reaction normally

timescale. Here we examine the consequences of rapid ejection of a fraction of
a solar mass of iron group material from the center of a collapsar/hypernova.
The exact rate of decay then depends on the details of the ionization and
therefore the ejection process. Future observations of iron, nickel and cobalt
lines can be used to diagnose the origin of these elements and to better
understand the astrophysical site of gamma ray bursts. In this model, the X-ray

core density of the halos at z=0 is typically higher at a given mass for lower
values of sig_0 or, at a given sig_0, for lower masses. For values of sig_0 as
high as 3.0, the halos may undergo the gravothermal catastrophe before z=0.
When alpha = 1, the core density of cluster- and MW-sized halos is similar.
Using sigma = 0.5-1.0x(1/v_100), our predictions agree with the central

Vmax-functions of subhalos in MW-sized halos with (sig_0,alpha) = (0.1,0.0),

specific angular momentum at a given mass shell and are rounder than their CDM
counterparts. We conclude that the introduction of SI particles with sigma
\propto 1/v_100 may remedy the cuspy core problem of the CDM cosmogony, while
the subhalo population number remains similar to that of the CDM halos.

evolving, indefinitely, in rather closed cycles between luminous and black
states. The new kind of linear black hole must absorb radiation until it can
explode after releasing new H gas that would trigger new luminous period of
star clusters and galaxies. Statistically, most of the galaxies must be in cool
states. The last ones should account for all of them, the higher velocities of
the galaxies in clusters, the radiation coming from intergalactic space,
including the low temperature black-body background observed in the CMBR.

  Top Quark Sector using Black Holes","18 pages, 2 figures",,,"UT-02-30","hep-ph hep-ex",,"  If TeV-scale gravity models are correct, the production of black holes will
be the first signal of new physics. Once black holes are produced, they will
give us much information about TeV-scale new physics directly. But such black
holes can also be used for the precision measurements of the Standard Model
(SM). The SM is nothing but a theory which can describe weak-scale, and
TeV-scale physics will affect it. So if some experimental results which cannot
be explained in the SM are found, they will be attributed to TeV-scale physics
and we can obtain ``bottom-up'' type information about new physics. In this
paper, we consider the precision measurements of the top sector at the LHC by
using black holes. The stringent trigger conditions to confirm the black hole
production vanish almost all of the QCD background, and we can examine the top
quark emitted from black holes very precisely. The error of the top quark mass
and the top Yukawa coupling are drastically reduced, leading to a very accurate
test of the Higgs mechanism. We can directly measure the CKM matrix element
|V_{ts}|, and we will understand the property of the CKM matrix and the origin
of CP-violation deeply. The very precise measurements of such properties in the
SM, enabled by black holes, can become treasures in the quest for TeV-scale
physics because there exists a possibility that TeV-scale physics affects them
and destroys the predictions of the SM. By combining the direct information of
new physics obtained from black holes themselves and the indirect information
obtained from the limitations of the SM, we will be able to identify TeV-scale
physics correctly.

  Distribution in Quantum Finance""",,,,"physics.soc-ph physics.data-an q-fin.ST",,"  A simple quantum model explains the Levy-unstable distributions for
individual stock returns observed by ref.[1]. The probability density function
of the returns is written as the squared modulus of an amplitude. For short
time intervals this amplitude is proportional to a Cauchy-distribution and
satisfies the Schroedinger equation with a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. The
observed power law tails of the return fluctuations imply that the ""decay
rate"", $\gamma(q)$ asymptotically is proportional to $|q|$, for large $|q|$.
The wave number, the Fourier-conjugate variable to the return, is interpreted
as a quantitative measure of ""market sentiment"". On a time scale of less than a
few weeks, the distribution of returns in this quantum model is shape stable
and scales. The model quantitatively reproduces the observed cumulative
distribution for the short-term normalized returns over 7 orders of magnitude
without adjustable parameters. The return fluctuations over large time periods
ultimately become Gaussian if $\gamma(q\sim 0)\propto q^2$. The ansatz
$\gamma(q)=b_T\sqrt{m^2+q^2}$ is found to describe the positive part of the
observed historic probability of normalized returns for time periods between
T=5 min and $T\sim 4$ years over more than 4 orders of magnitude in terms of
one adjustable parameter $s_T=m b_T\propto T$. The Sharpe ratio of a stock in
