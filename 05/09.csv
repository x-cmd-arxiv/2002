probable second parameter is different admixtures of magnetic stellar wind
braking (at up to 5 times the GR rate) in a small tail of systems, perhaps
implying that the donor magnetic field strength at formation is a second

below the gap with a wide range, being well below the GR rate in most CVs, but
significantly above it in a small tail.

around $\mu$ Her A, confirming it as a proper motion companion. Furthermore,
the observed H and K magnitudes of the companion were used to constrain its

coincides with the empirically derived surface density threshold for star
formation. Furthermore, it is shown that the drop in the thermal velocity
dispersion associated with the transition from the warm to the cold gas phase

strong turbulence does not undermine this conclusion if the disk is

decay (power-law decay slope alpha < 1.8 at 2 sigma). The optical/NIR spectral
index (beta_RH < 1.1) was consistent with the optical-to-X-ray spectral index

the Pleiades moving groups, we are able to show that subgroup B1, consisting of
early type B stars up to 10 Msun, but lacking more massive objects, has passed
through the local interstellar medium within less than 100 pc. Comparing the
stellar content of B1 with the initial mass function derived from the analysis
of galactic OB associations, we estimate the number of supernova explosions and
find that about 20 supernovae must have occurred during the past ~ 10 - 20
million years, which is suggested to be the age of the Local Bubble; the age of
the star cluster is about ~ 20 - 30 million years. For the first time, this
provides strong evidence that the Local Bubble must have been created and
shaped by multi-supernova explosions and presumably been reheated more than 1
million years ago, consistent with recent findings of an excess of 60Fe in a
deep ocean ferromanganese crust. Calculating similarity solutions of an
expanding superbubble for time-dependent energy input, we show that the number
of explosions is sufficient to explain the size of the Local Bubble. The
present energy input rate is about $\dot E_{SN}$ ~ 5 x 10^36 erg/s, in good
agreement with the estimated local soft X-ray photon output rate. It seems
plausible that the origin of the Local Bubble is also linked to the formation

generalizing a method due to Pesch. These are high field approximations

regulatory relationships among all cellular constituents that together comprise
the 'genetic network' of a cell or microorganism. Experimental manipulation of
gene activity coupled with the assessment of perturbed transcriptome (i. e.,
global mRNA expression) patterns represents one approach toward this goal, and
may provide a backbone into which other measurements can be later integrated.
  RESULT: We use microarray data on 287 single gene deletion Saccharomyces
cerevisiae mutant strains to elucidate generic relationships among perturbed
transcriptomes. Their comparison with a method that preferentially recognizes
distinct expression subpatterns allows us to pair those transcriptomes that
share localized similarities. Analyses of the resulting transcriptome
similarity network identify a continuum hierarchy among the deleted genes, and
in the frequency of local similarities that establishes the links among their
reorganized transcriptomes. We also find a combinatorial utilization of shared
expression subpatterns within individual links, with increasing quantitative
similarity among those that connect transcriptome states induced by the
deletion of functionally related gene products. This suggests a distinct
hierarchical and combinatorial organization of the S. cerevisiae
transcriptional activity, and may represent a pattern that is generic to the
transcriptional organization of all eukaryotic organisms.

of the experiments in terms of two interacting sublattices: the localized

were solved in a mean-field approximation, assuming for the itinerant electrons
a bare susceptibility independent on $T$. We obtained $\chi_{e}^{0} = 3.7$

ferromagnetic. Within the same model, we show that the ESR spectrum can be

At $H_{dc}=0$ the behavior of $\chi$ as a function of $\omega$ agrees very well
with the two fluid model, and the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility,
$\chi""(\omega)$, shows a dissipative a maximum at the frequency
$\nu_o=c^2/(4\pi \sigma\lambda^2)$. In the presence of a magnetic field a
second dissipation maximum appears at a frequency $\omega_p\ll\nu_0$. The most
interesting behavior of mesoscopic superconductors can be observed in the
$\chi(H_{dc})$ curves obtained at a fixed frequency. At a fixed number of
vortices, $\chi""(H_{dc})$ continuously increases with increasing $H_{dc}$. We
observe that the dissipation reaches a maximum for magnetic fields right below
the vortex penetration fields. Then, after each vortex penetration event, there
is a sudden suppression of the ac losses, showing discontinuities in
$\chi""(H_{dc})$ at several values of $H_{dc}$. We show that these
discontinuities are typical of the mesoscopic scale and disappear in
macroscopic samples, which have a continuos behavior of $\chi(H_{dc})$. We
argue that these discontinuities in $\chi(H_{dc})$ are due to the effect of
{\it nascent vortices} which cause a large variation of the amplitude of the
order parameter near the surface before the entrance of vortices.

fully described by a semi-latus rectum $p$, an eccentricity $e$, and an

$L_z$, and a third constant $Q$. Our scheme uses expressions that are exact
(within an adiabatic approximation) for the rates of change ($\dot{p}$,
$\dot{e}$, $\dot{\iota}$) as linear combinations of the fluxes ($\dot{E}$,
$\dot{L_z}$, $\dot{Q}$), but uses quadrupole-order formulae for these fluxes.
This scheme thus encodes the exact orbital dynamics, augmenting it with
approximate radiation reaction. Comparing inspiral trajectories, we find that
this approximation agrees well with numerical results for the special cases of
eccentric equatorial and circular inclined orbits, far more accurate than
corresponding weak-field formulae for ($\dot{p}$, $\dot{e}$, $\dot{\iota}$). We
use this technique to study the inspiral of a test-body in inclined, eccentric

summary of various consistent superstring theories and discuss T-duality which
necessarily leads to the presence of D-branes. The properties of D-branes are
summarized and we discuss how these suggest the existence of 11-dimensional
quantum theory, M-theory, which is believed to give rise to various
superstrings as perturbative expansions around particular backgrounds in the
theory. We also discuss the interpretation of brane solutions as black holes in
string theories and statistical explanation of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The
idea behind this interpretation is that there is a fundamental duality between
closed (gravity) and open (gauge theory) string degrees of freedom, one of
whose manifestation is what is kown as AdS/CFT correspondence. The idea is used
to discuss the greybody factors for BTZ black holes. Finally the entropy of
various balck holes are discussed in connection with Cardy-Verlinde formula.

and supersymmetry both broken by boundary conditions in a fifth dimension.
Despite the local explicit breaking of SU(5) at a boundary of the dimension,
the large size of the extra dimension allows precise predictions for gauge
coupling unification, alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.118 \pm 0.003, and for Yukawa coupling
unification, m_b(M_Z) = 3.3 \pm 0.2 GeV. A complete understanding of the MSSM
Higgs sector is given; with explanations for why the Higgs triplets are heavy,
why the Higgs doublets are protected from a large tree-level mass, and why the
mu and B parameters are naturally generated to be of order the SUSY breaking
scale. All sources of d=4,5 proton decay are forbidden, while a new origin for
d=6 proton decay is found to be important. Several aspects of flavor follow
from an essentially unique choice of matter location in the fifth dimension:
only the third generation has an SU(5) mass relation, and the lighter two
generations have small mixings with the heaviest generation. The entire
superpartner spectrum is predicted in terms of only two free parameters. The
squark and slepton masses are determined by their location in the fifth
dimension, allowing a significant experimental test of the detailed structure
of the extra dimension. Lepton flavor violation is found to be generically
large in higher dimensional unified theories with high mediation scales of SUSY
breaking. In our theory this forces a common location for all three neutrinos,
predicting large neutrino mixing angles. Rates for mu -> e gamma, mu -> e e e,
mu -> e conversion and tau -> mu gamma are larger in our theory than in
conventional 4D supersymmetric GUTs. Proposed experiments probing mu -> e
transitions will probe the entire interesting parameter space of our theory.

present constraints on the trilinear R-parity violating coupling constants and
assuming the gravitino and scalar superpartner masses do not exceed $\sim 80
TeV$, it turns out that the gravitinos could easily have decayed before the
present epoch but not earlier than the big-bang nucleosynthesis one. Therefore,
the considered scenario would upset the standard big-bang nucleosynthesis and

extra U(1) gauge symmetries beyond hypercharge. These symmetries are not of the
E_6 class but rather include the gauging of Baryon and Lepton numbers as well
as certain Peccei-Quinn-like symmetries. Some of the U(1)'s have triangle
anomalies, but they are cancelled by a Green-Schwarz mechanism. The
corresponding gauge bosons typically acquire a mass of order the string scale
M_S by combining with two-index antisymmetric fields coming from the closed
string sector of the theory. We argue that in string models with a low string
scale M_S proportional to 1-10 TeV, the presence of these generic U(1)'s may be
amenable to experimental test. Present constraints from electroweak precision
data already set important bounds on the mass of these extra gauge bosons. In
particular, for large classes of models, rho-parameter constraints imply M_S >=
1.5 TeV. In the present scheme some fraction of the experimentally measured Z^0
mass would be due not to the Higgs mechanism, but rather to the mixing with
these closed string fields. We give explicit formulae for recently constructed
classes of intersecting D6- and D5-brane models yielding the Standard Model
(SM) fermion spectrum.

light fermions. To avoid such a constraint, a scheme which assumes the first

one-loop EDM contributions. We point out that under such a scheme the most
severe constraint may come from a new contribution to the electric dipole
moments of the electron, the neutron or atoms via the chargino sector at the
two-loop level. As a result, the allowed parameter space for baryogenesis in
MSSM is severely constrained, independent of masses of the first two generation
sfermions.

  Universality of distance matrix is the necessary and sufficient condition on
the distance matrix of the countable everywhere dense set of so called
universal Urysohn space which he had defined in 1924 in his last paper. This
means that Urysohn space is generic in the set of all Polish spaces. Then we
consider metric spaces with measures (metric triples) and define a complete
invariant: its - matrix distribution. We give an intrinsic characterization of
the set of matrix distributions, and using the ergodic theorem, give a new
proof of Gromov's ``reconstruction theorem'. A natural construction of a wide

(2), Vol. 158 (2003), no. 3, 1067--1080",,,"math.FA math-ph math.CA math.MP",,"  The classic Poincare inequality bounds the $L^q$-norm of a function $f$ in a
bounded domain $\Omega \subset \R^n$ in terms of some $L^p$-norm of its
gradient in $\Omega$. We generalize this in two ways: In the first
generalization we remove a set $\Gamma$ from $\Omega$ and concentrate our
attention on $\Lambda = \Omega \setminus \Gamma$. This new domain might not
even be connected and hence no Poincare inequality can generally hold for it,
or if it does hold it might have a very bad constant. This is so even if the
volume of $\Gamma$ is arbitrarily small. A Poincare inequality does hold,
however, if one makes the additional assumption that $f$ has a finite $L^p$
gradient norm on the whole of $\Omega$, not just on $\Lambda$. The important
point is that the Poincare inequality thus obtained bounds the $L^q$-norm of
$f$ in terms of the $L^p$ gradient norm on $\Lambda$ (not $\Omega$) plus an
additional term that goes to zero as the volume of $\Gamma$ goes to zero. This
error term depends on $\Gamma$ only through its volume. Apart from this
additive error term, the constant in the inequality remains that of the `nice'
domain $\Omega$. In the second generalization we are given a vector field $A$
and replace $\nabla $ by $\nabla +i A(x)$ (geometrically, a connection on a
U(1) bundle). Unlike the A=0 case, the infimum of $\|(\nabla +i A)f\|_p $ over
all $f$ with a given $\|f\|_q$ is in general not zero. This permits an
improvement of the inequality by the addition of a term whose sharp value we
derive. We describe some open problems that arise from these generalizations.

Ginzburg-Landau equations, are introduced. The models include loss, the Kerr
nonlinearity, diffraction in one transverse direction, and a combination of
diffusion and dispersion in the other one (which is, actually, a temporal
direction). Each model is driven either parametrically or directly by an
external field. By means of direct simulations, stable completely localized
pulses are found (in the directly driven model, they are built on top of a
nonzero flat background). These solitary pulses correspond to spatio-temporal
solitons in the optical cavities. Basic results are presented in a compact form
as stability regions for the solitons in a full three-dimensional parameter
space of either model. The stability region is bounded by two surfaces; beyond
the left one, any two-dimensional (2D) pulse decays to zero, while quasi-1D
pulses, representing spatial solitons in the optical cavity, are found beyond
the right boundary. The spatial solitons are found to be stable both inside the
stability region of the 2D pulses (hence, bistability takes place in this
region) and beyond the right boundary of this region (although they are not
stable everywhere). Unlike the spatial solitons, their quasi-1D counterparts in
the form of purely temporal solitons are always subject to modulational
instability, which splits them into an array of 2D pulses, that further
coalesce into two final pulses. A uniform nonzero state in the parametrically
driven model is also modulationally unstable, which leads to formation of many
2D pulses that subsequently merge into few ones.

speciation, the emergence of new species from an initial one. The huge amount
of species found in nature demands a simple and robust mechanism. Yet, no
consensus has been reached concerning a reasonable disruptive selection
mechanism that prevents mixing genes among the emerging species, especially
when they live in sympatry. Usually it is assumed that females select males
according to their displaying traits, but males perform no selection on female
traits. However, recent experimental evidence accumulates towards the existence
of male choice. Here we propose a robust mechanism for sympatric speciation,
based on the assumption that sexual selection operates in two directions:
selection of males by females and of females by males. Complex mating
instabilities emerge, creating differential fitness depending on the
individuals displaying traits and preferences. When a secondary sexual trait is
introduced in a population, due to mutations, the activation of previously
neutral genes or due to a different perception of already existent displaying
traits, sympatric speciation may result (together with a species recognition
system) from a competitive exclusion principle. We suggest that potential
candidates to test our theory could be yeasts.

existence of a space-pervading field of ""zero-point energy"" (E_0=hbar.w/2 per
spatial dimension) associated to each particle of energy E. The latter leads to
an additional kinetic energy term in the classical Lagrangian, which alone
suffices to pass from classical to quantum mechanics. Moreover, Heisenberg's
uncertainty relations are also derived within this framework, i.e., without
referring to quantum mechanical or other complex-numbered functions.

next one through the evolution. In this letter, we show a way of speedup in
quantum adiabatic evolution algorithm, using the extended Hamiltonian. We
present the exact relation between the energy gap and the elements of the
