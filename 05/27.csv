galaxies in different cosmologies by means of two different models. The first
one is a modification and improvement of a model by Del Popolo & Gambera(1999),
namely based upon a modification of the top-hat model in order to take account
of angular momentum acquisition by protostructures and of an external pressure
term in the virial theorem. The second one is based on the merging-halo
formalism of Lacey & Cole (1993), accounting for the fact that massive clusters
accrete matter quasi-continuously, and is an improvement of a model proposed by
Voit (2000). The final result is that, in both models, the M-T relation shows a
break at T \sim 3-4 keV. The behavior of the M-T relation is as usual, M
\propto T^{3/2}, at the high mass end, and M \propto T^{\gamma}, with a value
of \gamma>3/2 depending on the chosen cosmology. The evolution of the M-T
relation, for a given M_{\rm vir}, is more modest both in flat and open
universes in comparison to previous estimate found in literature, even more
modest than what found by V2000. Moreover the time evolution is more rapid in
models with L=0 than in models in which the angular momentum acquisition by
protostructures is taken into account (L \neq 0). The effect of a non-zero
cosmological constant is that of slightly increasing the evolution of the M-T
relation with respect to open models with L \neq 0. The evolution is more rapid
for larger values (in absolute value) of the spectral index, n. The comparison
of the mass-temperature relation with the data by Finoguenov, Reiprich &
Bohringer (2001), shows that the FRB data is able to rule out very low Omega_0
models (<0.3), particularly in the open case, and that better fit are obtained
by LambdaCDM models and by CDM models with Omega_0>0.3.

central parts of a model is due to the presence of vertical resonances at which
stable families of periodic orbits bifurcate from the planar x1 family. The
orbits of these families reach in their projections on the equatorial plane a
maximum distance from the center, beyond which they increase their mean radii
by increasing only their deviations from the equatorial plane. The resulting
orbital profiles are `stair-type' and constitute the backbone for the observed
boxy structures in edge-on views of $N$-body models and, we believe, in edge-on
views of disc galaxies. Since the existence of vertical resonances is
independent of barred or spiral perturbations in the disc, `boxy' profiles may
appear also in almost axisymmetric cases.

molecular line emission toward the deeply embedded young stellar object IRAS
16293-2422 is performed. The continuum modelling is used to constrain the
temperature and density distributions in the envelope, enabling quantitative
estimates of various molecular abundances. The molecular excitation analysis
reveals that the emission from some molecular species is well reproduced
assuming a constant fractional abundance throughout the envelope. The
abundances and isotope ratios are generally close to typical values found in
cold molecular clouds in these cases, and there is a high degree of deuterium
fractionation. There are, however, a number of notable exceptions. Lines
covering a wide range of excitation conditions indicate for some molecules,
e.g., H2CO, CH3OH, SO, SO2 and OCS, a drastic increase in their abundances in
the warm and dense inner region of the circumstellar envelope. The location at
which this increase occurs is consistent with the radius at which ices are
expected to thermally evaporate off the grains. In all, there is strong
evidence for the presence of a `hot core' close to the protostar, whose
physical properties are similar to those detected towards most high mass
protostars except for a scaling factor. However, the small scale of the hot gas
and the infalling nature of the envelope lead to very different chemical time
scales between low mass and high mass hot cores, such that only very rapidly
produced second-generation complex molecules can be formed in IRAS 16293-2422.
Alternatively, the ices may be liberated due to grain-grain collisions in
turbulent shear zones where the outflow interacts with the envelope.

Reynolds numbers. Growth time scales of the magnetic field is comparable to the
convective turn-over time scale (approximately 150 seconds). The convective
velocity field concentrates the magnetic field in sheets and tubular structures

field strengths as high as 20 kG might be reached locally. Perhps surprisingly,

cannot be confined in the trap since the weak-field seeking state makes
transitions to the neutral and the strong-field seeking states due to the
degeneracy of these states along the vortex axis when the axial field vanishes.
We have solved the Gross-Pitaevskii equation numerically with given external
magnetic fields to show that this is not the case. It is shown that a
considerable fraction of the condensate remains in the trap even when the axial
field is reversed rather slowly. This scenario is also analysed in the presence
of an optical plug along the vortex axis. Then the condensate remains within
the $F_z=2$ manifold, with respect to the local magnetic field, throughout the
formation of a vortex and hence the loss of atoms does not take place.

that the elastic shell theory in the macroscopic scale can be applied to carbon

an isotropic material with Poisson ratio, effective thickness, and Young's

that automated elicitation provides a drastic benefit. In all of the
elicitation schemes under study, as the number of items for sale increases, the
amount of information elicited is a vanishing fraction of the information
collected in traditional ``direct revelation mechanisms'' where bidders reveal
all their valuation information. Most of the elicitation schemes also maintain
the benefit as the number of agents increases. We develop more effective
elicitation policies for existing query types. We also present a new query type
that takes the incremental nature of elicitation to a new level by allowing
agents to give approximate answers that are refined only on an as-needed basis.
In the process, we present methods for evaluating different types of
elicitation policies.

variational principle is a powerful tool for generating accurate estimates of
orbital parameters for neutron stars in quasi-equilibrium orbits. The second
part of the thesis details the numerical application of the variational
principle by solving the initial value problem for binary black holes in quasi-
equilibrium circular orbits. The analysis draws from the novel ``puncture''
method of describing the black holes, and relies on nonlinear adaptive
multigrid techniques for generating numerical results. We arrive at two
important conclusions. First, the analytical variational principle describing
binary neutron stars in irrotational motion provides a road map for future
numerical simulations, and also lends credence to previous simulations by other
authors. Second, the numerical application and description of binary black
holes in quasi-equilibrium circular orbits simplifies the analyses of previous
authors, and allows for the imposition of realistic boundary data in
simulations with relatively high grid densities. Both the variational principle
and its application are used to generate accurate estimates of the orbital

a direct contribution arising from early (hard) parton-parton collisions,
subject to subsequent nuclear absorption, quark-gluon plasma and hadronic
dissociation, and (ii) statistical production at the hadronization transition
by coalescence of $c$ and $\bar{c}$ quarks. Within an expanding thermal
fireball framework, the model reproduces $J/\Psi$ centrality dependencies
observed at the SPS in Pb-Pb and S-U collisions reasonably well. The study of
the $\Psi'/\Psi$ ratio at SPS points at the importance of the hadronic phase
for $\Psi'$ interactions, possibly related to effects of chiral symmetry
restoration. Predictions are given for the centrality dependence of the
$N_{J/\Psi}/N_{c\bar{c}}$ ratio at full RHIC energy. We also calculate the

them after the singularity. We propose several modifications of this scenario

that, using the same principle of equivalence, special relativity and quantum
theory in the {\it local Rindler frame} one can obtain the Einstein-Hilbert
action functional for gravity and thus the dynamics of the spacetime. This
approach, which essentially involves postulating that the horizon area must be
proportional to the entropy, uses the local Rindler frame as a natural
extension of the local inertial frame and leads to the interpretation that the
gravitational action represents the free energy of the spacetime geometry. As
an aside, one also obtains a natural explanation as to: (i) why the covariant
action for gravity contains second derivatives of the metric tensor and (ii)
why the gravitational coupling constant is positive. The analysis suggests that
gravity is intrinsically holographic and even intrinsically quantum mechanical.

approaches have been suggested for solving the general problem of
reconstructing binary matrices that are given by their discrete X-rays in a

possible solutions, by using appropriate a priori information, to only those
which are reasonably typical of the class of matrices which contains the
unknown matrix that we wish to reconstruct. Mathematically, this information is
modelled in terms of a class of binary matrices to which the solution must
belong. Several papers study the problem on classes of binary matrices on which
some connectivity and convexity constraints are imposed. We study the
reconstruction problem on some new classes consisting of binary matrices with
periodicity properties, and we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for
reconstructing these binary matrices from their orthogonal discrete X-rays.

  Classically, the regular representation of a group contains the complete

follow Baaj and Skandalis and study duality starting from an abstract version
of such a representation: the multiplicative unitary. We suggest extra
conditions which will replace the regularity and irreducibility of the

  The most important features of these objects are (1) that they are of a
purely algebraic nature and (2) that they have already a great complexity, very
similar to the general locally compact quantum groups. This means that they can
serve as a good model for the general objects, at least from the purely
algebraic point of view. They can therefore be used to study various aspects of
the general case, without going into the more difficult technical aspects, due
to the complicated analytic structure of a general locally compact quantum

concentrate on certain actions and how they behave with respect to this Fourier
transform. On the one hand, we will study this in a purely algebraic context

treatment introduced here. Concepts are viewed not as fixed representations,
but entities existing in states of potentiality that require interaction with a
context--a stimulus or another concept--to 'collapse' to an instantiated form
(e.g. exemplar, prototype, or other possibly imaginary instance). The stimulus
situation plays the role of the measurement in physics, acting as context that
induces a change of the cognitive state from superposition state to collapsed
state. The collapsed state is more likely to consist of a conjunction of
concepts for associative than analytic thought because more stimulus or concept
properties take part in the collapse. We provide two contextual measures of

standard quantum mechanics. More precisely, it was shown that two of the axioms
of traditional quantum axiomatics are at the origin of the impossibility for
standard quantum mechanics to describe this type of compound entity. One of
these axioms is equivalent with the superposition principle, which means that
separated quantum entities put the linearity of quantum mechanics at stake. We
analyze the conceptual steps that are involved in this proof, and expose the
necessary material of quantum axiomatics to be able to understand the argument

by means of its states, contexts and properties. The entity that we want to
describe does not necessarily have to be a physical entity, but can also be an
entity of a more abstract nature, for example a concept, or a cultural
artifact, or the mind of a person, etc..., which means that we aim at very
general description. The effect that a context has on the state of the entity
plays a fundamental role, which means that our approach is intrinsically
contextual. The approach is inspired by the mathematical formalisms that have
been developed in axiomatic quantum mechanics, where a specific type of quantum
contextuality is modelled. However, because in general states also influence
context -- which is not the case in quantum mechanics -- we need a more general
setting than the one used there. Our focus on context as a fundamental concept
makes it possible to unify `dynamical change' and `change under influence of
measurement', which makes our approach also more general and more powerful than
the traditional quantum axiomatic approaches. For this reason an experiment (or
measurement) is introduced as a specific kind of context. Mathematically we
introduce a state context property system as the structure to describe an
entity by means of its states, contexts and properties. We also strive from the
start to a categorical setting and derive the morphisms between state context
property systems from a merological covariance principle. We introduce the
category SCOP with as elements the state context property systems and as
morphisms the ones that we derived from this merological covariance principle.
We introduce property completeness and state completeness and study the
operational foundation of the formalism

'real' if we know that if we would try to test whether this object is present,
this test would give us the answer 'yes' with certainty. If we consider a
conception of reality where probability plays a fundamental role it can be
shown that standard probability theory is not well suited to substitute
'certainty' by means of 'probability equal to 1'. The analysis of this problem
leads us to propose a new type of probability theory that is a generalization
of standard probability theory. This new type of probability is a function to
the set of all subsets of the interval [0, 1] instead of to the interval [0, 1]
itself, and hence its evaluation happens by means of a subset instead of a
number. This subset corresponds to the different limits of sequences of
relative frequency that can arise when an intrinsic lack of knowledge about the
context and how it influences the state of the physical entity under study in
the process of experimentation is taken into account. The new probability
theory makes it possible to define probability on the whole set of experiments
within the Geneva-Brussels approach to quantum mechanics, which was not
possible with standard probability theory. We introduce the structure of a
'state experiment probability system' and derive the state property system as a
special case of this structure. The category SEP of state experiment
probability systems and their morphisms is linked with the category SP of state
property systems and their morphisms

  1/2 Entities","25 pages",,"10.1142/9789812778024_0003",,"quant-ph",,"  We illustrate some problems that are related to the existence of an
underlying linear structure at the level of the property lattice associated
with a physical system, for the particular case of two explicitly separated
spin 1/2 objects that are considered, and mathematically described, as one
compound system. It is shown that the separated product of the property
lattices corresponding with the two spin 1/2 objects does not have an
underlying linear structure, although the property lattices associated with the
subobjects in isolation manifestly do. This is related at a fundamental level
to the fact that separated products do not behave well with respect to the
covering law (and orthomodularity) of elementary lattice theory. In addition,
we discuss the orthogonality relation associated with the separated product in
general and consider the related problem of the behavior of the corresponding
Sasaki projections as partial state space mappings

possess three-generator Lie-algebraic structure in atomic physics, quantum
optics, nuclear physics and laser physics. The well-known fact that all simple
3-generator algebras are either isomorphic to the algebra $sl(2,C)$ or to one
of its real forms enables us to treat these time-dependent quantum systems in a
unified way. By making use of the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory and the
invariant-related unitary transformation formulation, the present paper obtains
exact solutions of the time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger equations governing
various three-generator quantum systems. For some quantum systems whose
time-dependent Hamiltonians have no quasialgebraic structures, we show that the
exact solutions can also be obtained by working in a sub-Hilbert-space
corresponding to a particular eigenvalue of the conserved generator (i.e., the
time-independent invariant that commutes with the time-dependent Hamiltonian).
The topological property of geometric phase factors in time-dependent systems
is briefly discussed.
