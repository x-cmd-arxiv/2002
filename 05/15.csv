early ($t \lessim $230 days) radio emission from SN1993J, where a mixture of
homogeneous and clumpy absorbers appeared to be necessary to adequately
describe the behavior of the light curves. The radio spectrum of supernova
SN1993J between 0.32 and 14.9 GHz is well characterized by $\alpha = -0.67 \pm
0.02 $ ($S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$), typical of an optically thin radio
supernova. A fit to the radio spectra of SN1993J from $\sim$ 70 up to 2820 days
shows that the observed spectral index of SN1993J has been slowly evolving
since $t\sim$1000 days on, with the observed spectral index changing from
$\alpha \approx -1$ to $\alpha=-0.67$. This spectral evolution seems to suggest
that, in addition to the radiative (synchrotron) losses, adiabatic cooling and
ionization (Coulomb) losses at the lowest frequencies might be contributing
significantly to the integrated electron spectrum.

of Seyfert 1s that exhibit polarization properties similar to those of Seyfert
2 galaxies in which polarized broad-lines have been discovered. These objects
represent direct observational evidence that a Seyfert 2-like far-field polar
scattering region is also present in Seyfert 1s. Several other objects have
features that can be explained in terms of equatorial scattering of line
emission from a rotating disk. We propose that much of the diversity in the

of the two geometries as sources of polarized light being determined
principally by the inclination of the system axis to the line-of-sight.

proven to be a powerful tool to study the mass distribution in the universe.
Nowadays, attention has shifted from clusters of galaxies to the statistical
properties of the large scale structures and the halos of (field) galaxies.
These applications have become feasible with the advent of panoramic cameras on
4m class telescopes. In this review we will give an overview of recent advances
in this fast evolving field of astronomy. We start with a discussion of the
recent measurements of weak lensing by large scale structure (``cosmic
shear''), which can be used to constrain cosmological parameters. We also show
how weak lensing can be used to measure the relation between galaxies and dark
matter (galaxy biasing) directly. Another area that benefitted greatly from the
current data is the weak lensing by galaxies (galaxy-galaxy lensing). Weak
lensing provides a unique probe of the gravitational potential on large scales.
Hence, in the context of dark matter, it can provide constrains on the extent
and shapes of dark matter halos. Furthermore, it can test alternative theories
of gravity (without dark matter). The best constraint comes from the first
detection of the anisotropy of the lensing signal around lens galaxies, which
suggest that the dark matter halos are flattened. An isotropic signal, as
predicted by MOND, is excluded with 99% confidence.

at the separatrix between the librating (horseshoe) and circulating
streamlines. A stationary solution is searched for the flow in the librating
region. When used to evaluate the torque exerted by the circulating material of
the outer and inner disk on the trapped material of the librating region, this
solution leads to an expression of the coorbital corotation torque in agreement
with previous estimates. An analytical expression is given for the corotation
torque as a function of viscosity. Lastly, we show that additional terms in the
torque expression can play a crucial role. In particular, they introduce a
coupling with the disk density profile perturbation (the `dip' which surrounds
the planet) and add to the corotation torque a small, positive fraction of the

directed outwards in very thin disks (aspect ratio smaller than a few percent).

  Astrophysical Journal",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Currently, two competing models are invoked in order to explain the
observable properties of Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs). One model assumes that
AXP emission is powered by a strongly magnetized neutron star - i.e., a
magnetar. Other groups have postulated that the unusually long spin periods
associated with AXPs could, instead, be due to accretion. As there are severe
observational constraints on any binary accretion model, fossil disk models
have been suggested as a plausible alternative. Here we analyze fossil disk
models of AXPs in some detail, and point out some of their inherent
inconsistencies. For example, we find that, unless it has an exceptionally high
magnetic field strength, a neutron star in a fossil disk cannot be observed as
an AXP if the disk opacity is dominated by Kramers' law. However, standard
alpha-disk models show that a Kramers opacity must dominate for the case log B
> 12, making it unlikely that a fossil disk scenario can successfully produce
AXPs. Additionally, we find that in order to sufficiently spin down a neutron
star in a fossil disk, an unusually efficient propeller torque must be used.
Such torques are inconsistent with observations of other accreting sytems -
particularly High Mass X-ray Binaries. Thus, our analysis lends credence to the
magnetar model of AXPs.

the off-axis contributions to the energy-momentum deposition rate (MDR) from
the neutrino anti-neutrino collisions above a rotating black hole/thin
accretion disk system. Our calculations are performed by imaging the accretion
disk at a specified observer using the full geodesic equations, and calculating
the cumulative MDR from the scattering of all pairs of neutrinos and
anti-neutrinos arriving at the observer. Our results shed light on the beaming
efficiency of GRB models of this kind. Although we confirm Asano and Fukuyama's
conjecture as to the constancy of the beaming for small angles away from the
axis; nevertheless, we find the dominant contribution to the MDR comes from
near the surface of the disk with a tilt of approximately \pi/4 in the
direction of the disk's rotation. We find that the MDR at large radii is
directed outward in a conic section centered around the symmetry axis and is
larger, by a factor of 10 to 20, than the on-axis values. By including this
off-axis disk source, we find a linear dependence of the MDR on the black hole
angular momentum (a). In addition, we find that scattering is directed back
onto the black hole in regions just above the horizon of the black hole. This
gravitational ``in scatter'' may provide an observable high energy signature of
the central engine, or at least another channel for accretion.

they rely on stellar parameters which are not affected by reddening; ii) they

instability strip and cover a wide metallicity range; iii) they were derived by
neglecting the RR Lyrae that are affected by amplitude modulation. Moreover,
the zero-point of the E(B-V) reddening scale was empirically checked using the
large sample of RR Lyrae in M3 (Corwin & Carney 2001), a GGC affected by a
vanishing reddening. According to these relations we estimated individual
reddenings for RR Lyrae in our sample and the main results we found are the

heavy elements should be sources of K_alpha X-ray line emission of the SN
nuclear-processed products. Supersonic motion of the knots in the intercloud
medium will result in a bow-shock/knot-shock structure creation. Fast
nonthermal particles accelerated by Fermi mechanism in the MHD collisionless
shocks diffuse through a cold metallic knot, producing the X-ray emission. We
modeled the X-ray emission from a fast moving knot of a mass M ~ 10^{-3} \Msun,
containing about 10^{-4} \Msun of any metal impurities like Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe.
The fast electron distribution was simulated using the kinetic description. We
accounted for nonlinear effects of shock modification by the nonthermal
particles pressure. The K_alpha line emission is most prominent for the knots
propagating through dense molecular clouds. The bow shock should be a radiative
wave with a prominent infrared and optical emission. In that case the X-ray
line spectrum of an ejecta fragment is dominated by the low ionization states
of the ions with the metal line luminosities reaching L_x \gsim 10^{31} erg/s.
High resolution XMM and Chandra observations are able to detect the line
emission from the knots at distances up to a few kpcs. The knots propagating
through tenuous interstellar matter are of much fainter surface brightness but
long-lived. The line spectra with higher ionization states of the ions are
expected in that case. Compact dense knots could be opaque for some X-ray lines
and that is important for their abundances interpretation. The ensemble of
unresolved knots of galactic supernovae can contribute substantially to the
iron line emission observed from the Galactic Center region and the Galactic
ridge.

(Norris et al.). Using VLT-UVES spectra of unprecedented quality, regarding
resolution and S/N ratio, covering a wide wavelength range (from $\lambda =
350$ to 900 nm), we have determined abundances for 21 elements in this star
over a wide range of atomic mass. The major new discovery is an exceptionally
large oxygen enhancement, [O/Fe] $= 1.97\pm0.1$, as measured from the [OI] line
at 630.0 nm. We find an enhancement of [N/Fe] of $2.56\pm 0.2$, and a milder
one of [C/Fe] $= 1.17\pm$0.1, similar to those already reported in the
literature. This implies $Z_{\star}=0.01 Z_{\odot}$. We also find carbon
isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$ =4\pm2.0$ and $^{13}$C/$^{14}$N$ =0.03
^{+0.035}_{-0.015}$, close to the equilibrium value of the CN cycle. Lithium is
not detected. Na is strongly enhanced ([Na/Fe] $= +2.1 \pm 0.2$), while S and K
are not detected. The silicon-burning elements Cr and Mn are underabundant,
while Co and Zn are overabundant ([Zn/Fe]$ = +0.7$). Zn is measured for the
first time in such an extremely metal-poor star. The abundances of the
neutron-capture elements Sr, Y, and Ba are strongly decreasing with the atomic
number of the element: [Sr/Fe] $\approx +0.3$, [Y/Fe] $\approx -0.1$, and
[Ba/Fe] $\approx -0.6$. Among possible progenitors of CS 22949--037, we discuss
the pair-instability supernovae. Such very massive objects indeed produce large
amounts of oxygen, and have been found to be possible sources of primary
nitrogen. Other scenarios are also discussed. A 30-40$M_{\odot}$ supernova,
with fallback, seems the most likely progenitor for CS 22949--037.

Equation for the second-order correlation function of a magnetic field is
derived. This equation comprises spatial derivatives of high orders due to a
non-local nature of magnetic field transport in a random velocity field with a
finite correlation time. For a random Gaussian velocity field with a small
correlation time the equation for the second-order correlation function of the
magnetic field is a third-order partial differential equation. For this
velocity field and a small magnetic diffusion with large magnetic Prandtl
numbers the growth rate of the second moment of magnetic field is estimated.
The finite correlation time of a turbulent velocity field causes an increase of
the growth rate of magnetic fluctuations. It is demonstrated that the results
obtained for the cases of a small yet finite magnetic diffusion and a zero
magnetic diffusion are different. Astrophysical applications of the obtained
results are discussed.

superconducting (SC) state in both the spin S=0 and S=1/2 sectors. We find a
transition from the singlet d-wave SC state to a spin doublet SC state when the
renormalized exchange coupling exceeds a doping dependent critical value. The
induced S=1/2 moment is staggered and localized around the impurity. It arises
from the binding of an S=1/2 nodal quasiparticle excitation to the impurity.
The local density of states spectrum is calculated and connections to NMR and
STM experiments are discussed.

Superconductivity in the organic and cuprate superconductors is a genuine three

superconductivity destroys the latter in the 2D limit even in the ground state.
The data uncovers the flow to quantum criticality, including the 2D quantum
superconductor to insulator (2D-QSI) and the 3D quantum superconductor to
normal state (3D-QSN) transition. This flow gives a clear perspective of the
regimes where quantum fluctuations are essential and mean-field treatments
fail. Thus, a detailed account of the flow from mean-field to 2D-QSI
criticality in organics and the crossover from the 2D-QSI to the 3D-QSN
critical point in cuprates is a challenge for microscopic theories attempting
to solve the puzzle of superconductivity in these materials.

to the effect of the pseudogap that causes \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} to be
increasingly more enhanced as p is reduced. The pseudogap also causes a rapid
growth of \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} with decreasing temperature, and, as a result, the

that accommodate naturally within Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics (based

point toward nonextensive statistical mechanics (based on $S_q \equiv k [1-\int
du [p(u)]^q]/[q-1]$, where the value of the entropic index $q\in\Re$ depends on
the specific model). We show here a family of models, with multiplicative
noise, which belongs to the nonextensive class. More specifically, we consider
Langevin equations of the type $\dot{u}=f(u)+g(u)\xi(t)+\eta(t)$, where
$\xi(t)$ and $\eta(t)$ are independent zero-mean Gaussian white noises with
respective amplitudes $M$ and $A$. This leads to the Fokker-Planck equation
$\partial_t P(u,t) = -\partial_u[f(u) P(u,t)] +
M\partial_u\{g(u)\partial_u[g(u)P(u,t)]\} + A\partial_{uu}P(u,t)$. Whenever the

that a proper explanation of these features will require a much deeper
understanding of the initial state of our universe. On the other hand,
inflationary models are spectacularly successful in providing an explanation of
the deviations from homogeneity. We point out here that the fundamental
mechanism responsible for providing deviations from homogeneity -- namely, the
evolutionary behavior of quantum modes with wavelength larger than the Hubble
radius -- will operate whether or not inflation itself occurs. However, if
inflation did not occur, one must directly confront the issue of the initial
state of modes whose wavelength was larger than the Hubble radius at the time
at which they were ""born"". Under some simple hypotheses concerning the ""birth

shown that non-inflationary fluid models in the extremely early universe would

This may be a signature for glueball production. The enhancement is shown to be

uncertainties in modelling the decay distributions in b->ulnu transitions. The
largest uncertainties arise from the limited knowledge of the appropriate b
quark mass and Fermi momentum to use in the parameterization of the shape
function. This paper presents a new method in which these shape function
parameters are constrained by the same data used to measure |Vub|. The method
requires measurements of the momenta of both the charged lepton and the
neutrino in semileptonic B decays. From these quantities two complementary
observables can be constructed, one for discriminating between b->ulnu
transitions and background and the other for constraining the shape function.
Using this technique the uncertainties in |Vub| from the shape function may be
significantly reduced.

next-to-leading and higher order corrections. A substantial process dependence
of gluon shadowing is found at the scale of charm mass manifesting a deviation
from QCD factorization. The magnitude of the shadowing effect correlates with
the symmetry properties and color state of the produced c-cbar pair. It is
about twice as large as in DIS, but smaller than for charmonium production. The
higher twist shadowing correction related to a nonzero size of the c-cbar pair
is not negligible and steeply rises with energy. We predict an appreciable
suppression by shadowing for charm production in heavy ion collisions at RHIC
and a stronger effect at LHC. At the same time, we expect no visible difference
between nuclear effects for minimal bias and central collisions, as is
suggested by recent data from the PHENIX experiment at RHIC. We also
demonstrate that at medium high energies when no shadowing is possible, final
state interaction may cause a rather strong absorption of heavy flavored

We show that it is very difficult to obtain inflation in the simplest versions
of this theory. Typically, inflation in these theories could occur only at
super-Planckian densities, where the effective 4D field theory is inapplicable.
Reheating and creation of matter in models where the tachyon potential V(T) has
a minimum at infinitely large T is problematic because the tachyon field in
such theories does not oscillate. If the universe after inflation is dominated
by the energy density of the tachyon condensate, it will always remain
dominated by the tachyons. It might happen that string condensation is
responsible for a short stage of inflation at a nearly Planckian density, but
one would need to have a second stage of inflation after that. This would imply
that the tachyon played no role in the post-inflationary universe until the
very late stages of its evolution. These problems do not appear in the recently
proposed models of hybrid inflation where the complex tachyon field has a
minimum at T << M_p.

applied to MTF and thus identify the initial state that gives the
stochastically smallest running time; by contrast, the initial state used in
the previous study gives the stochastically largest running time. By changing
from worst choice to best choice of initial state we achieve remarkable speedup
of FMMR for MTF; for example, we reduce the running time (as measured in Markov
chain steps) from exponential in the length n of the list nearly down to n when
the items in the list are requested according to a geometric distribution. For
this same example, the running time for CFTP grows exponentially in n.

  measurement","18 pages","Phys. Rev. A 66, 043811 (2002)","10.1103/PhysRevA.66.043811",,"quant-ph",,"  In this paper we present a state vector analysis of the generation of atomic
spin squeezing by measurement of an optical phase shift. The frequency
resolution is improved when a spin squeezed sample is used for spectroscopy in
place of an uncorrelated sample. When light is transmitted through an atomic
sample some photons will be scattered out of the incident beam, and this has a
destructive effect on the squeezing. We present quantitative studies for three
limiting cases: the case of a sample of atoms of size smaller than the optical
wavelength, the case of a large dilute sample and the case of a large dense
sample.

n-bit hypercube from one corner to its opposite is polynomial in n. This gives
the first exponential quantum-classical gap in the hitting time of discrete

give two alternative definitions to set the ground for its study on general
graphs. We then give an application to random routing.

know the outcome, are we able to retrodict it with a second measurement? We
obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for perfect retrodiction of the
outcome of a known generalised measurement, given the final state, for an
arbitrary initial state. From this, we deduce that, when the input and output
Hilbert spaces have equal (finite) dimension, it is impossible to perfectly
retrodict the outcome of any fine-grained measurement (where each POVM element
corresponds to a single Kraus operator) for all initial states unless the
measurement is unitarily equivalent to a projective measurement. It also
enables us to show that every POVM can be realised in such a way that perfect
outcome retrodiction is possible for an arbitrary initial state when the number
of outcomes does not exceed the output Hilbert space dimension. We then
consider the situation where the initial state is not arbitrary, though it may
be entangled, and describe the conditions under which unambiguous outcome
retrodiction is possible for a fine-grained generalised measurement. We find
that this is possible for some state if the Kraus operators are linearly
independent. This condition is also necessary when the Kraus operators are
non-singular. From this, we deduce that every trace-preserving quantum
operation is associated with a generalised measurement whose outcome is
unambiguously retrodictable for some initial state, and also that a set of
unitary operators can be unambiguously discriminated iff they are linearly
independent. We then examine the issue of unambiguous outcome retrodiction
without entanglement. This has important connections with the theory of locally
linearly dependent and locally linearly independent operators.
