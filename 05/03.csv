observed kinematics of elliptical galaxies are affected by dust attenuation. In
Paper I and Paper II, we investigated the effects of dust absorption; here we
extend our modelling in order to include the effects of scattering. We describe
how kinematical information can be combined with the radiative transfer
equation, and present a Monte Carlo code that can handle kinematical
information in an elegant way.
  Compared to the case where only absorption is taken into account, we find
that dust attenuation considerably affects the observed kinematics when
scattering is included. For the central lines of sight, dust can either
decrease or increase the central observed velocity dispersion. The most
important effect of dust attenuation, however, is found at large projected
radii. The kinematics at these lines of sight are strongly affected by photons
scattered into these lines of sight, which were emitted by high-velocity stars
in the central regions of the galaxy. These photons bias the LOSVDs towards
high line-of-sight velocities, and significantly increase the observed velocity
dispersion and LOSVD shape parameters. These effects are similar to the
expected kinematical signature of a dark matter halo, such that dust
attenuation may form an alternative explanation for the usual stellar
kinematical evidence for dark matter halos around elliptical galaxies.
  We apply our results to discuss several other topics in galactic dynamics,
where we feel dust attenuation should be taken into account. In particular, we
argue that the kinematics observed at various wavelengths can help to constrain
the spatial distribution of dust in elliptical galaxies.

photometric structural parameters for 7450 galaxies in the ``Groth Strip.''
These parameters are based on a two-dimensional bulge+disk surface brightness
model and were obtained using an automated reduction and analysis pipeline
described in detail here. A first set of fits was performed separately in each
bandpass, and a second set of fits was performed simultaneously on both
bandpasses. The information produced by these two types of fits can be used to
explore different science goals. Systematic and random fitting errors in all
structural parameters as well as bulge and disk colors are carefully
characterized through extensive sets of simulations. The results of these
simulations are given in catalogs similar to the real science catalogs so that
both real and simulated measurements can be sampled according to the same
selection criteria to show biases and errors in the science data subset of
interest. The effects of asymmetric structures on the recovered bulge+disk
fitting parameters are also explored through simulations. The full
multidimensional photometric survey selection function of the Groth Strip is
also computed. This selection function, coupled to bias maps from simulations,
provides a complete and objective reproduction of the observational limits, and
these limits can be applied to theoretical predictions from galaxy evolution
models for direct comparisons with the data.

radial velocities (+/-12 km/s) and metallicities (+/-0.26 dex) for over 200
members of the M31 globular cluster population out to a radius of 1.5 degrees

the spatial, kinematic and metal abundance properties of the M31 globular

consistent with a bimodal distribution with peaks at [Fe/H] = -1.4 and -0.5.
The metal-rich clusters demonstrate a centrally concentrated spatial
distribution with a high rotation amplitude, although this population does not
appear significantly flattened and is consistent with a bulge population. The
metal-poor clusters tend to be less spatially concentrated and are also found
to have a strong rotation signature.

proposed for this source: a neutron star accreting from the interstellar
medium, an off-beam radio pulsar, or an old, cooling magnetar. Using data from
Chandra, ROSAT, and BeppoSAX we are able to place an upper limit to the period
derivative, $|\dot{P}| < 3.6\times10^{-13}{s s}^{-1}$ (3-$\sigma$). While our
upper limit on $\dot P$ allows for the accretion model, this model is
increasingly untenable for another similar but better studied neutron star, RX
J1856.5-3754, and we therefore consider the accretion model unlikely for RX
J0720.4-3125. We constrain the initial magnetic field of RX J0720.4-3125 to be
$\lsim 10^{14}$ G based on cooling models, suggesting that it is not and never
was a magnetar, but is instead middle-aged neutron star. We propose that it is
either a long-period high-magnetic field pulsar with $\dot P\sim 10^{-13}{s

period of $\approx 8.3$ s and $\dot P\sim 10^{-15}{s s}^{-1}$. The proximity of

and near-IR spectra, demonstrate MMD11 to be an interacting system of at least
three components: a luminous blue source, a fainter blue source, and an
extremely red object (ERO) with R-K>6. The separations between components are
\~8 kpc (Lambda=0.7, Omega_M=0.3, h=0.65), similar to some of the local
ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIGs). The lack of obvious AGN in MMD11,
along with the fragmented, early stage merger morphology, suggest a young
forming environment. While we cannot unambiguously identify the location of the
far-IR emission within the system, analogy to similar ULIGs suggests the ERO as
the likely far-IR source. The >10^{12} L_sun bolometric luminosity of MMD11 can
be predicted reasonably from its rest frame UV properties once all components
are taken into account, however this is not typically the case for local
galaxies of similar luminosities. While LBGs as red in g-R and R-K as MMD11 are
rare, they can only be found over the restricted 2.7 < z < 3.0 range. Therefore
a substantial number of MMD11-like galaxies (~<0.62 arcmin^{-2}) may exist when
integrated over the likely redshift range of SCUBA sources (z=1 -5), suggesting
that SCUBA sources should not necessarily be seen as completely orthogonal to

to derive an upper mass limit for those satellites that might have survived to

Survey (2QZ). We analyse QSO clustering as a function of apparent magnitude.
The strong luminosity evolution of QSOs means that this is approximately
equivalent to analysing the data as a function of absolute magnitude relative
to M* over the redshift range that the 2QZ probes. Over the relatively narrow
range in apparent magnitude of the 2QZ we find no significant (>2sigma)
variation in the strength of clustering, however, there is marginal evidence
for QSOs with brighter apparent magnitudes having a stronger clustering
amplitude. QSOs with 18.25<bj<19.80 show a correlation scale length
s_0=5.50+-0.79h-1Mpc in an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe and
s_0=8.37+-1.17h-1Mpc in a universe with omega_0=0.3 and lambda_0=0.7 (Lambda),

is a factor 1.22+-0.15 (EdS) or 1.24+-0.15 (Lambda) larger than that of the
full data set. An increase in clustering with luminosity, if confirmed, would
be in qualitative agreement with models in which the luminosity of a QSO is
correlated to the mass of the dark halo in which it resides, implying that the
mass of the host plays at least some part in determining a QSO's formation and
evolution. These models predict that the clustering in brighter QSO data sets,
such as Sloan Digital Sky Survey QSO sample or the bright extension of the 2QZ
should show a higher clustering amplitude than the 2QZ.

observations, the simulated L_X-sigma and L_X-T_X relations are steeper than
those predicted by adiabatic simulations or self-similar models, with
L_X\propto sigma^{4.4} and L_X\propto T_X^{2.6} for massive groups and
significantly steeper relations below a break at sigma~180 km/s (T_X~0.7 keV),
but T_X-sigma is fairly close to self-similar, with T_X\propto sigma^{1.75}.
The entropy of hot gas in low mass groups is higher than predicted by
self-similar scaling, and agrees with observations that suggest an ""entropy
floor"". The steeper scalings of the luminosity relations are driven by
radiative cooling, which reduces the hot gas fraction from 50% of the total
baryons at sigma \approx 500 km/s to 20% at sigma \approx 100 km/s. A secondary
effect is that hot gas in smaller systems is less clumpy, further driving down
L_X. A smaller volume simulation with eight times higher mass resolution
predicts nearly identical X-ray luminosities at a given group mass,
demonstrating the insensitivity of the predicted scaling relations to numerical
resolution. There remain some quantitative discrepancies: the predicted mass
scale of the L_X-T_X and L_X-sigma breaks is somewhat too low, and the
luminosity-weighted temperatures are too high at a given sigma. We conclude
that radiative cooling has an important quantitative impact on group X-ray
properties and can account for many of the observed trends that have been
interpreted as evidence for non-gravitational heating. (abridged)

cm^-3, having essentially unity filling factor, and one with a density of ~500
cm^-3, having a very small (~10^-5) filling factor. Because the temperatures of
these two components are similar, they cannot be in pressure equilibrium, and
there is no obvious source of confinement for the dense regions. We estimate
that the dense regions will dissipate on timescales <~10^4 years and therefore
need to be continuously regenerated, most likely by shocks. Because we know
that some QSOs, at least, begin their lives in conjunction with merger-driven
massive starbursts in their host galaxies, an attractive interpretation is that
the extended emission region comprises gas that has been expelled as a result
of tidal forces during the merger and is now being shocked by the galactic
superwind from the starburst. This picture is supported by the observed
distribution of the ionized gas, the presence of velocities ranging up to ~700
km s^{-1}, and the existence of at least two QSOs having similarly luminous and
complex extended emission regions that are known to have ultra-luminous IR
galaxy hosts with current or recent starbursts.

results by Contopoulos, Ciolek, & Konigl that did not include rotation. Our
model includes ambipolar diffusion and magnetic braking and allows us to
examine the full range of expected behaviors and their dependence on the
physical parameters. For typical parameter values, the inflow first passes
through an ambipolar-diffusion shock (at a radius r_a, where the magnetic flux
decouples from the matter), and later through a centrifugal shock at r=r_c, the
outer edge of a rotationally supported disk of mass M_d. By the time (~10^5 yr)
that the central mass M_c grows to ~1 M_\sun, r_a may be larger than 1000 AU,
r_c larger than 100 AU, and M_d/M_c smaller than 10%. Disk properties are
consistent with data on T Tauri systems, and our results imply that
protostellar disks may well be Keplerian also during earlier phases. We show
that the disk is likely to drive centrifugal outflows transporting angular
momentum and mass, and we incorporate these effects into the model. We verify
that gravitational torques and magnetorotational instability-induced turbulence
typically do not play an important role in the angular momentum transport. We
also present solutions for the limiting cases of fast rotation (where collapse
results in a massive disk with such a large outer radius that it traps the
ambipolar diffusion front) and strong braking (where no disk is formed and the
collapse resembles that of a nonrotating core at small radii), as well as
solutions for the rotational collapse of ideal-MHD and nonmagnetic model cores.

bar from Difference Image Analysis (DIA) of the MACHO Collaboration. First, I
present supplementary evidence that MACHO field 104 located at (l,b) =
(3.11,-3.01) is anomalous in terms of the event duration distribution. I argue
that both the event durations and the very high optical depth of field 104 are
not representative and, therefore, exclude this field as an outlier. In
addition, I eliminate field 159 at (l,b) = (6.35,-4.40) based mainly on its
separate location, but also on unexplained statistical properties of the event
durations. The remaining six DIA fields form a very homogeneous and spatially
compact set that is very suitable for averaging. The weighting of the optical
depth values for these six DIA fields results in a total optical depth
tau_{tot} = 2.01^{+0.34}_{-0.32} x 10^{-6} at (l,b) = (2.22,-3.18). If a
fraction of all sources, f_{disk}, assumed to be in the disk, does not
contribute to microlensing, then the optical depth toward the sources in the
bar is tau_{bar} = 2.23^{+0.38}_{-0.35} x 10^{-6} 0.9/(1-f_{disk}). Both
tau_{tot} and tau_{bar} are substantially lower than the original estimates of
Alcock et al. Most of the change in the DIA-based optical depths comes from a
more appropriate statistical treatment of the results in individual fields and
not from the removal of fields 104 and 159. When taken together with tau_{bar}
= (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10^{-6} at (l,b) = (3.9,-3.8) as derived from clump giants,
this new result suggests that the conclusions from microlensing experiments are
in reasonable agreement with the expectations from infrared-based Galactic

issue of the spectral contributions of Compton reflection and iron line
fluorescence from circumnuclear gas. The empirical description adopted for the
direct continuum is the commonly used power law with an exponential cut-off.
The most direct test of the theoretical predictions, namely that the equivalent
width of the line, Walpha, and the strength R of the reflection relative to the
direct continuum are closely related to each other, gives a substantially
positive result, that is their mean ratio is very close to expectation, and
only a modest spread in the iron abundance seems implied. The existence of a
steep correlation between R and the slope Gamma of the power law is not
confirmed. A weak evidence is found that the existence of a very shallow trend
to increase on average with Gamma cannot be altogether excluded in both R and
Walpha, but needs to be tested with a larger sample. The energy Ef in the
exponential cut-off spans a range from about 80 to more than 300 keV. A
possible correlation is found, with Ef increasing on average with Gamma: if
ignored, for instance by keeping Ef at a fixed value in a sample study, it
could be cause of artificial steepening in a correlation between R and Gamma.

generalized for the simultaneous solution of all the states of the system using
a penalty functional to keep the states orthogonal. Special care has been taken
to optimize the iterations towards the self-consistency and to run the code in
parallel computer architectures. The scheme has been implemented in multiple
geometries. We show examples from electronic structure calculations employing
nonlocal pseudopotentials and/or the jellium model. The RQMG solver is also
applied for the calculation of positron states in solids.

are only possible for a restricted subset of the LRS models in which there is
no evolution in one spacelike direction. These results are applied to spatially

bounded interior region without holes. We find that it is impossible to embed
finite static strings or other locally cylindrically symmetric static objects

models, irrespective of the matter content. Furthermore, we find that if the
exterior spacetime is assumed to have a perfect fluid source satisfying the
dominant energy condition, then only a very particular family of LRS stiff
fluid solutions are compatible with this model.
  Finally, given the interior/exterior duality in the matching procedure, our
results have the interesting consequence that the Oppenheimer-Snyder model of
collapse cannot be generalised to such anisotropic cases.

supersymmetric dark matter. It is known that coannihilation effects could be
important in neutralino relic density calculation. Here we present some results
on neutralino-stop coannihilation in the CMSSM. In this model, the lighter stop
can be degenerate with the lightest neutralino chi when |A_0| is not equal to 0
and large, more specifically when the lighter stop mass is suppressed by large
off-diagonal terms in the stop square mass matrix. In the region where the stop
is slightly heavier than the neutralino, the coannihilation effect brings the
relic density into the range favored by cosmology. While the neutralino-stop
coannihilation channels do not increase the range of m_chi, they do extend the
cosmologically preferred region to larger values of m_0.

a hierarchical pattern of the symmetry breaking: G->U(1) at V->nothing at v,

tube) is perfectly stable, being considered in the full theory it is
metastable. We consider the simplest example: the magnetic flux tubes in the
SU(2) gauge theory with adjoint and fundamental scalars. First, the adjoint
scalar develops a vacuum expectation value V breaking SU(2) down to U(1). Then,
at a much lower scale, the fundamental scalar (quark) develops a vacuum
expectation value v creating the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen string. (We also
consider an alternative scenario in which the second breaking, U(1)->nothing,
is due to an adjoint field.) We suggest an illustrative ansatz describing an
""unwinding"" in SU(2) of the winding inherent to the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen
strings in U(1). This ansatz determines an effective 2D theory for the unstable
mode on the string world-sheet. We calculate the decay rate (per unit length of
the string) in this ansatz and then derive a general formula. The decay rate is
exponentially suppressed. The suppressing exponent is proportional to the ratio
of the monopole mass squared to the string tension, which is quite natural in
view of the string breaking through the monopole-antimonopole pair production.
We compare our result with the one given by Schwinger's formula dualized for
describing the monopole-antimonopole pair production in the magnetic field.

stably flat, i.e. Tor^R_i(\sigma^{-1}R,\sigma^{-1}R) is non-zero for some i>0.
It is also shown that there is no algorithm to determine if two Malcolmson
normal forms represent the same element of \sigma^{-1}R.

develops a theoretical framework of such functional relation and illustrates
the main theoretical conclusions using numerical simulations.

reactions on $O^{16}$ in different kinematical settings using two theoretical
approaches. The first one is based on a relativistic mean-field distorted-wave
description of the bound and scattering states of the proton, including a fully
relativistic electromagnetic current operator. The second approach adopts the
same current operator, but describes the proton properties consistently on the
basis of microscopic calculations of the self-energy in $O^{16}$ below the
Fermi energy and final-state damping in nuclear matter above the Fermi energy,
using the same realistic short-range and tensor correlations. Good agreement
with all unpolarized and polarized data is obtained at low and high $Q^2$ by
using the same spectroscopic factors fixed by the low-$Q^2$ analysis,
indicating that a high degree of internal consistency has been reached.

systems. In many cases, biological effects display `windows' in biologically
effective parameters of the magnetic fields: most dramatic is the fact that
relatively intense magnetic fields sometimes do not cause appreciable effect,
while smaller fields of the order of 10--100 $\mu$T do. Linear resonant
physical processes do not explain frequency windows in this case. Amplitude
window phenomena suggest a nonlinear physical mechanism. Such a nonlinear
mechanism has been proposed recently to explain those `windows'. It considers
quantum-interference effects on protein-bound substrate ions. Magnetic fields
cause an interference of ion quantum states and change the probability of
ion-protein dissociation. This ion-interference mechanism predicts specific
magnetic-field frequency and amplitude windows within which biological effects
occur. It agrees with a lot of experiments. However, according to the
mechanism, the lifetime $\Gamma^{-1}$ of ion quantum states within a protein
cavity should be of unrealistic value, more than 0.01 s for frequency band
10--100 Hz. In this paper, a biophysical mechanism has been proposed that (i)
retains the attractive features of the ion interference mechanism and (ii) uses
the principles of gyroscopic motion and removes the necessity to postulate
large lifetimes. The mechanism considers dynamics of the density matrix of the
molecular groups, which are attached to the walls of protein cavities by two
covalent bonds, i.e., molecular gyroscopes. Numerical computations have shown
almost free rotations of the molecular gyros. The relaxation time due to van
der Waals forces was about 0.01 s for the cavity size of 28 angstr\""{o}ms.

is an invariant measure. It is shown that this implies the existence of
canonically associated Bell states that serve as measuring rods by relating the
metric geometry of the manifold to the observed EPR correlations. It is further
shown that these correlations can be accounted for by a hidden variable theory
which is non-local but invariant under the stability group of the reference
