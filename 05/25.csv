  Astrophysical Journal","Astrophys.J.577:337-345,2002","10.1086/342152",,"astro-ph",,"  We report the discovery with the Proportional Counter Array on board the
Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer of highly coherent 582 Hz pulsations during the
February 22, 2001 (UT) ``superburst'' from 4U 1636-53. The pulsations are
detected during an 800 s interval spanning the flux maximum of the burst.
Within this interval the barycentric oscillation frequency increases in a
monotonic fashion from 581.89 to 581.93 Hz. The predicted orbital motion of the
neutron star during this interval is consistent with such an increase as long
as optical maximum corresponds roughly with superior conjunction of V801 Arae,
the optical companion to the neutron star in 4U 1636-53. We show that a range
of circular orbits with velocity 90 < v sin i < 175 km/s and fractional phase
0.336 > p > 0.277 for the neutron star can provide an excellent description of
the frequency and phase evolution. The average pulse profile is sinusoidal and
the time averaged pulsation amplitude, as inferred from the half amplitude of
the sinusoid is 1%, smaller than typical for burst oscillations observed in
normal thermonuclear bursts. We do not detect any higher harmonics nor the
putative subharmonic near 290 Hz. The 90% upper limits on signal amplitude at
the subharmonic and first harmonic are 0.1% and 0.06%, respectively. The
coherent pulsation provides compelling evidence for a rapidly rotating neutron
star in 4U 1636-53, and further supports the connection of burst oscillation
frequencies with the spin frequencies of neutron stars. Our results provide
further evidence that some millisecond pulsars are spun up via accretion in
LMXBs. We also discuss the implications of our orbital velocity constraint for
the masses of the components of 4U 1636-53.

  Scheduled to appear on 20th September 2002",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) luminosities form the `backbone' of our
understanding of star formation at all cosmic epochs. These luminosities are
typically corrected for dust by assuming that the tight relationship between
the UV spectral slopes and the FUV attenuations of starburst galaxies applies
for all star-forming galaxies. Data from seven independent UV experiments
demonstrates that quiescent, `normal' star-forming galaxies deviate
substantially from the starburst galaxy spectral slope-attenuation correlation,
in the sense that normal galaxies are redder than starbursts. Spatially
resolved data for the Large Magellanic Cloud suggests that dust geometry and
properties, coupled with a small contribution from older stellar populations,
cause deviations from the starburst galaxy spectral slope-attenuation
correlation. Folding in data for starbursts and ultra-luminous infrared
galaxies, it is clear that neither rest-frame UV-optical colors nor UV/H-alpha
significantly help in constraining the UV attenuation. These results argue that
the estimation of SF rates from rest-frame UV and optical data alone is subject
to large (factors of at least a few) systematic uncertainties because of dust,
which cannot be reliably corrected for using only UV/optical diagnostics.

the blackbody fit under an assumption of R = 10 km. Deep optical imaging with
the HST STIS CCD failed to detect this source to a limit of V > 28.5, thus
f_X/f_V > 6000 and d > 250 pc assuming the X-ray fitted temperature for the

quantum gravity. It is sometimes argued that this minimal length might conflict
with Lorentz invariance, because a boosted observer could see the minimal
length further Lorentz contracted. We show that this is not the case within
loop quantum gravity. In loop quantum gravity the minimal length (more
precisely, minimal area) does not appear as a fixed property of geometry, but
rather as the minimal (nonzero) eigenvalue of a quantum observable. The boosted
observer can see the same observable spectrum, with the same minimal area. What
changes continuously in the boost transformation is not the value of the
minimal length: it is the probability distribution of seeing one or the other
of the discrete eigenvalues of the area. We discuss several difficulties
associated with boosts and area measurement in quantum gravity. We compute the
transformation of the area operator under a local boost, propose an explicit
expression for the generator of local boosts and give the conditions under
which its action is unitary.

behaviour are characterized by an anisotropy exponent theta or a dynamical
exponent z. For a given value of theta, we construct local scale
transformations which can be viewed as scale transformations with a
space-time-dependent dilatation factor. Two distinct types of local scale
transformations are found. The first type may describe strongly anisotropic
scaling of static systems with a given value of theta, whereas the second type
may describe dynamical scaling with a dynamical exponent z. Local scale
transformations act as a dynamical symmetry group of certain non-local
free-field theories. Known special cases of local scale invariance are
conformal invariance for theta=1 and Schrodinger invariance for theta=2. The
hypothesis of local scale invariance implies that two-point functions of
quasiprimary operators satisfy certain linear fractional differential
equations, which are constructed from commuting fractional derivatives. The
explicit solution of these yields exact expressions for two-point correlators
at equilibrium and for two-point response functions out of equilibrium.
Aparticularly simple and general form is found for the two-time autoresponse
function. These predictions are explicitly confirmed at the uniaxial Lifshitz
points in the ANNNI and ANNNS models and in the aging behaviour of simple
ferromagnets such as the kinetic Glauber-Ising model and the kinetic spherical
model with a non-conserved order parameter undergoing either phase-ordering
kinetics or non-equilibrium critical dynamics.

number, YMCS is gauge-invariant and consistent. However, individual solitons
such as sphalerons and linked center vortices with CS number of 1/2 and
writhing center vortices with arbitrary CS number are non-compact; a condensate
of them threatens compactness of the theory. We study various forms of the
non-compact theory in the dilute-gas approximation, treating the parameters of
non-compact large gauge transformations as collective coordinates. We conclude:
1) YMCS theory dynamically compactifies; non-compact YMCS have infinitely
higher vacuum energy than compact YMCS. 2) An odd number of sphalerons is
associated with a domain- wall sphaleron, a pure-gauge configuration on a
closed surface enclosing them and with a half-integral CS number. 3) We
interpret the domain-wall sphaleron in terms of fictitious closed Abelian
magnetic field lines that express the links of the Hopf fibration. Sphalerons
are over- and under-crossings of knots in the field lines; the domain-wall
sphaleron is a superconducting wall confining these knots to a compact domain.
4) Analogous results hold for center vortices and nexuses. 5) For a CS term
induced with an odd number of fermion doublets, domain-wall sphalerons are
related to non-normalizable fermion modes. 6) GGCS with monopoles is
compactified with center-vortex-like strings.

  147-158",,,"physics.data-an physics.ins-det physics.med-ph",,"  The problem of mixed signals occurs in many different contexts; one of the
most familiar being acoustics. The forward problem in acoustics consists of
finding the sound pressure levels at various detectors resulting from sound
signals emanating from the active acoustic sources. The inverse problem
consists of using the sound recorded by the detectors to separate the signals
and recover the original source waveforms. In general, the inverse problem is
unsolvable without additional information. This general problem is called
source separation, and several techniques have been developed that utilize
maximum entropy, minimum mutual information, and maximum likelihood. In
previous work, it has been demonstrated that these techniques can be recast in
a Bayesian framework. This paper demonstrates the power of the Bayesian
approach, which provides a natural means for incorporating prior information
into a source model. An algorithm is developed that utilizes information
regarding both the statistics of the amplitudes of the signals emitted by the
sources and the relative locations of the detectors. Using this prior
information, the algorithm finds the most probable source behavior and
configuration. Thus, the inverse problem can be solved by simultaneously
performing source separation and localization. It should be noted that this
algorithm is not designed to account for delay times that are often important
in acoustic source separation. However, a possible application of this
algorithm is in the separation of electrophysiological signals obtained using
electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG).

build upon a recent (1998) re-analysis of the original data by Munera, which
revealed small but significant effects after allowing for several systematic
errors in the original analyses. The further re-analysis here reveals that a
genuine effect of absolute motion is expected, in what is essentially a quantum
interference experiment, but only if the photons travel in the interferometer
at speeds V < c. This is the case if the interferometer operates in a
dielectric, such as air, or helium as was the case of the Illingworth (1927)
Michelson-Morley experiment. The re-analysis here of the Illingworth
experimental data correcting for the refractive index effect of the helium,
reveals an absolute speed of the Earth of v=369+/-123 km/s, which is in
agreement with the speed of v=365+/-18 km/s determined from the dipole fit, in
1991, to the NASA COBE satellite Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR)
observations. These experimental results refute Einstein's assertion that
absolute motion through space has no meaning, and require a re-assessment of
the interpretation of General Relativity.

unknown quantum state, and the disturbance caused to that state by the
measurement process. I show that for any distribution of initial states, the
information-disturbance frontier is convex, and disturbance is nondecreasing
with information gain. I consider the most general model of quantum
measurements, and all post-measurement dynamics compatible with a given
measurement. For the uniform initial distribution over states, I show that the
least-disturbing way of making any measurement is with conditional dynamics
satisfying a generalization of the projection postulate, the ``square-root
dynamics.'' Thus, procedures for achieving a point on the
information-disturbance frontier may be assumed to involve such conditional
dynamics. Also, the information-disturbance frontier for the uniform ensemble
may be achieved with ``isotropic'' (unitarily covariant) dynamics. This results
in a significant simplification of the optimization problem for calculating the
tradeoff in this case, giving hope for a closed-form solution. I also show that
the discrete ensembles uniform on the d(d+1) vectors of a certain set of d+1
``mutually unbiased'' or conjugate bases in d dimensions form spherical
2-designs in CP_{d-1} when d is a power of an odd prime. This implies that many
