Galaxies (LBGs) in the region of the Hubble Deep Field North, derived from the
1 Ms public Chandra observation. Of our sample of 148 LBGs, four are detected
individually. This immediately gives a measure of the bright AGN fraction in
these galaxies of $\sim 3$~per cent, which is in agreement with that derived
from the UV spectra. The X-ray color of the detected sources indicates that
they are probably moderately obscured. Stacking of the remainder shows a
significant detection ($6\sigma$) with an average luminosity of $3.5 \times
10^{41}$~erg s$^{-1}$ per galaxy in the rest frame 2-10 keV band. We have also
studied a comparison sample of 95 z$\sim 1$ ``Balmer Break'' galaxies. Eight of
these are detected directly, with at least two clear AGN based on their high
X-ray luminosity and very hard X-ray spectra respectively. The remainder are of
relatively low luminosity ($<10^{42}$~erg s$^{-1}$), and the X-rays could arise
from either AGN or rapid star-formation. The X-ray colors and evidence from
other wavebands favor the latter interpretation. Excluding the clear AGN, we
deduce a mean X-ray luminosity of $6.6 \times 10^{40}$~erg s$^{-1}$, a factor
$\sim 5$ lower than the LBGs. The average ratio of the UV and X-ray
luminosities of these starforming galaxies $L_{\rm UV}/L_{\rm X}$, however, is
approximately the same at $z = 1$ as it is at $z = 3$. This scaling implies
that the X-ray emission follows the current star formation rate, as measured by
the UV luminosity. We use our results to constrain the star formation rate at
$z\sim 3$ from an X-ray perspective (truncated).

of LCDM cosmologies with scale-invariant initial power spectra. Although n=1 is
often justified by appealing to the inflation scenario, inflationary models
with mild deviations from scale-invariance are not uncommon and models with
significant running of the spectral index are plausible. Even mild deviations
from scale-invariance can be important because halo collapse times and
densities depend on the relative amount of small-scale power. We choose several
popular models of inflation and work out the ramifications for galaxy central
densities. For each model, we calculate its COBE-normalized power spectrum and
deduce the implied halo densities using a semi-analytic method calibrated
against N-body simulations. We compare our predictions to a sample of dark
matter-dominated galaxies using a non-parametric measure of the density. While
standard n=1, LCDM halos are overdense by a factor of 6, several of our example
inflation+CDM models predict halo densities well within the range preferred by
observations. We also show how the presence of massive (0.5 eV) neutrinos may
help to alleviate the central density problem even with n=1. We conclude that
galaxy central densities may not be as problematic for the CDM paradigm as is
sometimes assumed: rather than telling us something about the nature of the
dark matter, galaxy rotation curves may be telling us something about inflation
and/or neutrinos. An important test of this idea will be an eventual consensus
on the value of sigma_8, the rms overdensity on the scale 8 h^-1 Mpc. Our
successful models have values of sigma_8 approximately 0.75, which is within
the range of recent determinations. Finally, models with n>1 (or sigma_8 > 1)
are highly disfavored.

clusters to the processes that govern galaxy formation. These models treat the
entropy distribution of the intracluster medium as its most fundamental
property. Because convection strives to establish an entropy gradient that
rises with radius, the observable properties of a relaxed cluster depend
entirely on its dark-matter potential and the entropy distribution of its
uncondensed gas. Guided by simulations, we compute the intracluster entropy
distribution that arises in the absence of radiative cooling and supernova
heating by assuming that the gas-density distribution would be identical to
that of the dark matter. The lowest-entropy gas would then fall below a
critical entropy threshold at which the cooling time equals a Hubble time.
Radiative cooling and whatever feedback is associated with it must modify the
entropy of that low-entropy gas, changing the overall entropy distribution
function and thereby altering the observable properties of the cluster. Using
some phenomenological prescriptions for entropy modification based on the
existence of this cooling threshold, we construct a remarkably realistic set of
cluster models. The surface-brightness profiles, mass-temperature relation, and
luminosity-temperature relation of observed clusters all naturally emerge from
these models. By introducing a single adjustable parameter related to the
amount of intracluster gas that can cool within a Hubble time, we can also
reproduce the observed temperature gradients of clusters and the deviations of
cooling-flow clusters from the standard luminosity-temperature relation.

sensitivity limit corresponding to an absolute magnitude of M_B <= -6.3. From
our observed limits, we rule out as the progenitor all evolved states of single
stars with initial masses greater than 20Msol unless the WR phase has been
entered. Two popular theories for the origin of Type Ic SNe are the core
collapse of massive stars when they are in the WR phase, or the core collapse
of a massive star in an interacting binary which has had its envelope stripped
through mass transfer. Our prediscovery images are sensitive only to the most
luminous ~30% of WR stars, leaving a substantial fraction of typical WR stars
as viable progenitors. The energetics measured from modelling the spectral
evolution of SN 2002ap suggest an explosion of a 5Msol C+O core. While WR stars
generally have measured final masses greater than this, the uncertainties
associated with the explosion model, stellar evolutionary calculations and mass
measurements suggest we cannot definitively rule out a WR star progenitor. The
alternative scenario is that the progenitor was a star of initial mass

surrounded by a striking emission line nebula. The nebula contains an
equatorial ring and probable bi-polar outflows, and is similar in morphology,
mass and kinematics to the structure visible around SN1987A. It has been
suggested that both nebulae were ejected while Sher25 and the progenitor of
SN1987A were in previous red supergiant phases. We present optical
high-resolution spectra of Sher25 and a model photosphere and unified stellar
wind analysis which determines atmospheric parameters, mass-loss rate and
photospheric abundances. We compare CNO abundances to other Galactic B-type
supergiants and find that Sher25 does not appear extreme or abnormal in terms
of its photospheric nitrogen and helium abundances. The C/N and N/O ratios are
compared to surface abundances predicted by stellar evolutionary calculations
and are incompatible with the star having a previous red-supergiant phase. The
nebula is likely to have been ejected while the star was a blue supergiant. The
results are compatible with some degree of rotationally induced mixing having
occurred while the star was on or near the main-sequence. Our analsysis
suggests the star has a relatively normal stellar wind and mass-loss rate, and
sits comfortably within the wind momentum-luminosity relationship. In light of
the evidence regarding massive evolved early-type stars in the Galaxy we
suggest there is no object which shows clear evidence of having had a previous
red supergiant phase and hence of undergoing blue loops in the HR diagram.

questions, such as the evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies,
require transforming these magnitudes into redshift-independent quantities. To
prepare to address these astronomical questions, investigated in detail in
subsequent papers, we fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to broad band
photometric observations, in the context of the optical observations of the

can reproduce the five SDSS magnitudes of all galaxies to the precision of the
photometry. Expressed in the appropriate coordinate system, the locus of the
coefficients multiplying the templates is planar, and in fact nearly linear.
The resulting reconstructed SEDs can be used to recover fixed frame magnitudes
over a range of redshifts. This process yields consistent results, in the sense
that within each sample the intrinsic colors of similar type galaxies are
nearly constant with redshift. We compare our results to simpler interpolation
methods and galaxy spectrophotometry from the SDSS. The software that generates
these results is publicly available and easily adapted to handle a wide range

upper luminosity boundary in the HR diagram. During their post--RSG evolution,
these massive stars enter a temperature range (6000-9000 K) of increased
dynamical instability, high mass loss, and increasing opacity, a
semi--forbidden region, that de Jager and his collaborators have called the
`yellow void'. We report HST/STIS spatially resolved spectroscopy of IRC +10420
and its reflection nebula with some surprising results. Long slit spectroscopy
of the reflected spectrum allows us to effectively view the star from different
directions. Measurements of the double--peaked Halpha emission profile show a
uniform outflow of gas in a nearly spherical distribution, contrary to previous
models with an equatorial disk or bipolar outflow. Based on the temperature and
mass loss rate estimates that are usually quoted for this object, the wind is
optically thick to the continuum at some and possibly all wavelengths.
Consequently the observed variations in apparent spectral type and inferred
temperature are changes in the wind and do not necessarily mean that the
underlying stellar radius and interior structure are evolving on such a short
timescale. To explain the evidence for simultaneous outflow and infall of
material near the star, we propose a `rain' model in which blobs of gas
condense in regions of lowered opacity outside the dense wind. With the
apparent warming of its wind, the recent appearance of strong emission, and a
decline in the mass loss rate, IRC +10420 may be about to shed its opaque wind,
cross the `yellow void', and emerge as a hotter star.

physical parameters determined from uniformly modelling their spectral energy
distributions (SEDs). Our analysis indicates that for Flat Spectrum Radio
Quasars the total jet power is of the same order as the accretion power. We
suggest that blazar jets are likely powered by energy extraction from a rapidly
spinning black hole through the magnetic field provided by the accretion disk.
FSRQs must have large BH masses (10^8 - 10^9 solar masses) and high, near
Eddington accretion rates. For BL Lac objects the jet luminosity is larger than
the disk luminosity. This can be understood within the same scenario if BL Lac
objects have masses similar to FSRQ but accrete at largely subcritical rates,
whereby the accretion disk radiates inefficiently. Thus the ``unification'' of
the two classes into a single blazar population, previously proposed on the
basis of a spectral sequence governed by luminosity, finds a physical basis.

Fourier transforms of several line profiles in the range 4200--4600 A are used
to derive vsini from the frequency of the first zero. Statistical analysis of

relative error of the rotational velocity is found to be about 5% on average.

basic assumptions are that (1) the magnetic reconnection heat is cooled down
overwhelmingly by Compton scattering in the corona and that (2) thermal
conduction is dominantly cooled by evaporation of the chromospheric plasma in
the disk-corona interface before Compton cooling sets in. With these two basic
equations as well as equi-partition of magnetic energy with gas energy in the
disk, we can consistently determine the fraction of accretion energy dissipated
in the corona without free parameters, and thus determine the temperature and
all other quantities in both the corona and disk for given black hole mass and
accretion rate. Then, we calculate the luminosity contributed from the disk and
corona and the coronal flux weighted Compton $y$ parameter. It is found that,
at a low luminosity (less than 0.1 Eddington luminosity) the spectrum is hard
with energy spectral index of around 1, while at a high luminosity (larger than
0.1 Eddington luminosity) the spectrum can be either soft or hard. We also find
that the situation is almost same for supermassive and stellar-mass black
holes. These features are consistent with observations of AGNs and GBHCs.

predicted by current CDM-based hierarchical models. They can be fitted by a
combination of moderate merging with a decrease with redshift in the comoving
number density of passive galaxies. We investigate the angular correlation
function and find that the EROs have a much higher correlation amplitude than
full K-limited samples of galaxies. This implies that the intrinsic clustering
of EROs is stronger than that of present-day E/S0 galaxies. We estimate the
comoving correlation radius as 10-13 Mpc. We estimate seeing-corrected angular
sizes and morphological types for a K<19.5 subsample (31 galaxies), and find a

assumes that in the depletion layer the nonequilibrium chemical potentials of
spin up and spin down carriers are constant and carrier recombination and spin
relaxation are inhibited. Under the general conditions of an applied bias and
externally injected (source) spin, the model formulates analytically carrier
and spin transport in magnetic p-n junctions at low bias. The evaluation of the
carrier and spin densities at the depletion layer establishes the necessary
boundary conditions for solving the diffusive transport equations in the bulk
regions separately, thus greatly simplifying the problem. The carrier and spin
density and current profiles in the bulk regions are calculated and the I-V
characteristics of the junction are obtained. It is demonstrated that spin
injection through the depletion layer of a magnetic p-n junction is not
possible unless nonequilibrium spin accumulates in the bulk regions--either by
external spin injection or by the application of a large bias. Implications of

Alignment-Based Learning, which is based on the alignment of sentences and
Harris's (1951) notion of substitutability. Instances of the framework can be
applied to an untagged, unstructured corpus of natural language sentences,
resulting in a labelled, bracketed version of that corpus.
  Firstly, the framework aligns all sentences in the corpus in pairs, resulting
in a partition of the sentences consisting of parts of the sentences that are
equal in both sentences and parts that are unequal. Unequal parts of sentences
can be seen as being substitutable for each other, since substituting one
unequal part for the other results in another valid sentence. The unequal parts
of the sentences are thus considered to be possible (possibly overlapping)
constituents, called hypotheses.
  Secondly, the selection learning phase considers all hypotheses found by the
alignment learning phase and selects the best of these. The hypotheses are
selected based on the order in which they were found, or based on a
probabilistic function.
  The framework can be extended with a grammar extraction phase. This extended
framework is called parseABL. Instead of returning a structured version of the
unstructured input corpus, like the ABL system, this system also returns a
stochastic context-free or tree substitution grammar.
  Different instances of the framework have been tested on the English ATIS
corpus, the Dutch OVIS corpus and the Wall Street Journal corpus. One of the
interesting results, apart from the encouraging numerical results, is that all
instances can (and do) learn recursive structures.

areas of spacecraft design and high-precision navigation. We present a concept
for a designated deep-space mission to test the discovered anomaly. A number of
critical requirements and design considerations for such a mission are outlined
and addressed.

Space Interferometry Mission (SIM). We address the issue of general
relativistic deflection of light by the massive self-gravitating bodies.
Specifically, we present estimates for corresponding deflection angles due to
the monopole components of the gravitational fields of a large number of
celestial bodies in the solar system. We study the possibility of deriving an
additional navigational constraints from the need to correct for the
gravitational bending of light that is traversing the solar system. It turns
out that positions of the outer planets presently may not have a sufficient
accuracy for the precision astrometry. However, SIM may significantly improve
those simply as a by-product of its astrometric program. We also consider
influence of the higher gravitational multipoles, notably the quadrupole and
the octupole ones, on the gravitational bending of light. Thus, one will have
to model and account for their influence while observing the sources of
interest in the close proximity of some of the outer planets, notably the
Jupiter and the Saturn. Results presented here are different from the ones
obtained elsewhere by the fact that we specifically account for the
differential nature of the future SIM astrometric campaign (e.g. observations
will be made over the instrument's field of regard with the size of
15$^\circ$). This, in particular, lets us to obtain a more realistic estimate
for the accuracy of determination of the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN)
parameter $\gamma$. Thus, based on a very conservative assumptions, we conclude
that accuracy of $\sigma_\gamma \sim 10^{-5}$ is achievable in the experiments
conducted in the solar gravity field.

for SIM, we have considered a problem of relative astrometric observations of
two stars separated by angle $\theta$ on the sky with a single baseline
interferometer. While a definitive answer on the stellar aberration issue may
be obtained only in numerical simulations based on the accurate astrometric
model of the instrument, one could still derive realistic conclusions by
accounting for the main expected properties of SIM. In particular, we have
analysied how the expected astrometric accuracy of determination of positions,
parallaxes and proper motions will constrain the accuracy of the spaceraft
navigation. We estimated the astrometric errors introduced by imperfect
metrology (variations of the calibration term across the tile of interest),
errors in the baseline length estimations, and those due to orbital motion of
the spacecraft. We also estimate requirements on the data sampling rate
necessary to apply on-board in order to correct for the stellar aberration. We
have shown that the worst case observation scenario is realized for the motion
of the spacecraft in the direction perpendicular to the tile. This case of
motion will provide the most stringent requirement on the accuracy of knowledge
of the velocity's magnitude. We discuss the implication of the results obtained

GeV) - should herald departures from Lorentz invariance, and the possibility of
testing these expectations in the not too distant future, two so-called ""Doubly
Special Relativity"" theories have been suggested -- the first by
Amelino-Camelia (DSR1) and the second by Smolin and Magueijo (DSR2). These
theories contain two fundamental scales -- the speed of light and an energy
usually taken to be Ep. The symmetry group is still the Lorentz group, but in
both cases acting nonlinearly on the energy-momentum sector. Accordingly, since
energy and momentum are no longer additive quantities, finding their values for
composite systems (and hence finding the correct conservation laws) is a
nontrivial matter. Ultimately it is these possible deviations from simple
linearly realized relativistic kinematics that provide the most promising
observational signal for empirically testing these models. Various
investigations have narrowed the conservation laws down to two possibilities
per DSR theory. We derive unique exact results for the energy-momentum of
composite systems in both DSR1 and DSR2, and indicate the general strategy for
arbitrary nonlinear realizations of the Lorentz group.

We consider the evolution of a physical object (the Universe) in ``physical''
subspace of extended configurational space, the latter including gauge and
ghost degrees of freedom. A measure of the ``physical'' subspace depends on a
chosen reference frame, in particular, a small variation of a gauge-fixing
function results in changing the measure. Thus, a transition to another gauge
condition (another reference frame) leads to non-unitary transformation of a
physical part of the wave function. From the viewpoint of the evolution of the
Universe in the ``physical'' subspace a transition to another reference frame
is an irreversible process that may be important when spacetime manifold has a
nontrivial topology.

Even after including the meson-loop self-energies which give rise to the

variation in the region of light quark mass), we find surprisingly little
curvature in the quenched case. Replacing these meson-loop self-energies by the
corresponding terms in full QCD yields a remarkable level of agreement with the
results of the full QCD simulations. This comparison leads to a very good
understanding of the origins of the mass splitting between these baryons.

lower tail estimate for the last-passage growth model associated with the
exclusion process. A stronger estimate has been proved for the corresponding
discrete time model, so we take the needed estimate as a hypothesis. The
process is initially in local equilibrium with a slowly varying macroscopic
profile. The macroscopic initial profile is smooth in a neighborhood of the
origin where the second-class particle starts off, and the forward
characteristic from the origin is not a shock. Given these assumptions, the
result is that the typical fluctuation of the second-class particle is not of
larger order than n^{2/3}(log n)^{1/3}, where n is the ratio of the macroscopic
and microscopic space scales. The conjectured correct order should be n^{2/3}.

varieties in generalized flag manifolds $G/B$ in terms of patterns in root
systems. We generalize Lakshmibai-Sandhya's well-known result that says that a
Schubert variety in $SL(n)/B$ is smooth if and only if the corresponding
permutation avoids the patterns 3412 and 4231. Our criterion is formulated
uniformly in general Lie theoretic terms. We define a notion of pattern in Weyl
group elements and show that a Schubert variety is smooth (or rationally
smooth) if and only if the corresponding element of the Weyl group avoids a
certain finite list of patterns. These forbidden patterns live only in root
subsystems with star-shaped Dynkin diagrams. In the simply-laced case the list
of forbidden patterns is especially simple: besides two patterns of type $A_3$
that appear in Lakshmibai-Sandhya's criterion we only need one additional
forbidden pattern of type $D_4$. Remarkably, several other important classes of
elements in Weyl groups can also be described in terms of forbidden patterns.
For example, the fully commutative elements in Weyl groups have such a
characterization. In order to prove our criterion we used several known results
for the classical types. For the exceptional types, our proof is based on
computer verifications. In order to conduct such a verification for the
computationally challenging type $E_8$, we derived several general results on

simultaneous avoidance (multi-avoidance) of two or more 3-patterns with no
internal dashes, that is, where the patterns correspond to contiguous subwords
in a permutation. There either an explicit or a recursive formula was given for
all but one case of simultaneous avoidance of more than two patterns.
  In this paper we find the exponential generating function for the remaining
case. Also we consider permutations that avoid a pattern of the form $x-yz$ or
$xy-z$ and begin with one of the patterns $12... k$, $k(k-1)... 1$, $23... k1$,
$(k-1)(k-2)... 1k$ or end with one of the patterns $12... k$, $k(k-1)... 1$,
$1k(k-1)... 2$, $k12... (k-1)$. For each of these cases we find either the
ordinary or exponential generating functions or a precise formula for the

as well as some of the results given in [Kit3]: we consider permutations
avoiding certain generalized 3-patterns and beginning (ending) with an
arbitrary pattern having either the greatest or the least letter as its

the S(E->0). Contrary to previous findings, we prove that S(E->0) is not

  From the linearized kinetic equations we get the dispersion relations of the

of the interplay between scalar and vector channel contributions. A beautiful
``mirror'' structure in the form of the dynamical response in the
isoscalar/isovector degree of freedom is revealed, with a complete parallelism
in the role respectively played by the compressibility and the symmetry energy.
All that strongly supports the introduction of an explicit coupling to the
scalar-isovector channel of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. In particular we
study the influence of this coupling (to a $\delta$-meson-like effective field)
on the collective response of asymmetric nuclear matter ($ANM$). Interesting
contributions are found on the propagation of isovector-like modes at normal
density and on an expected smooth transition to isoscalar-like oscillations at
high baryon density. Important ``chemical'' effects on the neutron-proton
structure of the mode are shown. For dilute $ANM$ we have the isospin
distillation mechanism of the unstable isoscalar-like oscillations, while at
high baryon density we predict an almost pure neutron wave structure of the
propagating sounds.

different. The problem is here simply resolved by an explicit computation to

There is predicted not only $\cos \theta$-interference of probabilities, but
also hyperbolic $\cosh \theta$-interference. This interference was never

B: Quantum Semiclass. Opt. 4 (December 2002) 421-424","10.1088/1464-4266/4/6/309",,"quant-ph",,"  We propose and demonstrate a system that produces squeezed vacuum using a
pair of optical parametric amplifiers. This scheme allows the production of
phase sidebands on the squeezed vacuum which facilitate phase locking in
downstream applications. We observe strong, stably locked, continuous wave
vacuum squeezing at frequencies as low as 220 kHz. We propose an alternative
resonator configuration to overcome low frequency squeezing degradation caused
by the optical parametric amplifiers.

measurement and displacement strategies. This refinement makes use of prior
knowledge about the target state and the partial information carried by the
classical channel when entanglement is non-maximal. This gives an improvement
in the output quality of the protocol. The strategies we introduce could be
used in current continuous variable teleportation experiments.

Lett. 89, 210402 (2002)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.210402",,"quant-ph",,"  Several experiments and experimental proposals for the production of
macroscopic superpositions naturally lead to states of the general form
$|\phi_1>^{\otimes N}+|\phi_2>^{\otimes N}$, where the number of subsystems $N$
is very large, but the states of the individual subsystems have large overlap,
$|{\l}\phi_1|\phi_2 \r|^2=1-\epsilon^2$. We propose two different methods for
assigning an effective particle number to such states, using ideal
Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ)-- states of the form $|0\r^{\otimes
n}+|1\r^{\otimes n}$ as a standard of comparison. The two methods are based on
decoherence and on a distillation protocol respectively. Both lead to an
effective size $n$ of the order of $N \epsilon^2$.

interaction couples them. Here we characterize the amount, as measured by time,
of interaction required to perform two--qubit gates, when also arbitrarily
fast, local unitary transformations can be applied on each qubit. The minimal
required time of interaction, or interaction cost, defines an operational
notion of the degree of non--locality of gates. We characterize a partial order
structure based on this notion. We also investigate the interaction cost of
several communication tasks, and determine which gates are able to accomplish
them. This classifies two--qubit gates into four categories, differing in their
capability to transmit classical, as well as quantum, bits of information.
