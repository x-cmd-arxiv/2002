Spectra of this type of stars for which the Hipparcos Catalogue gives
parallaxes with an error of less than 20% were observed with the CIDA 1-meter
reflector equipped with a Richardson spectrograph with a Thompson 576x384 CCD
detector. The dispersion is 1.753 A/pixel using a 600 lines/mm grating in the
first order. In order to cover the spectral range 3850 A to 5750 A the grating
had to be used in two different positions, with an overlap in the region from
4800 A to 4900 A. A total of 116 stars was oberved, but not all with both
grating positions. A total of 12 measureable absorption lines was identified in
the spectra and their equivalent widths were measured. These were related to
the absolute magnitudes derived from the Hipparcos Catalogue and to the
intrinsic colors (deduced from the MK spectral types) using linear and second
order polynomials and two or three lines as independent variables. The best
solutions were obtained with polynomials of three lines, reproducing the
absolute magnitudes with an average residual of about 0.40 magnitudes and the
intrinsic colors with an average residual of 0.016 magnitudes.

6166, the cD galaxy in the cluster Abell 2199, in order to measure the
kinematics of intracluster starlight at large radii. The velocity dispersion
rises beyond a few kpc, and steadily rises to 660 km/s at a radius of 60 kpc,
nearly reaching the velocity dispersion of the cluster (775+-50 km/s). These
data suggest that the stars in the halo of the cD trace the potential of the
cluster and that the kinematics of these intracluster stars can be used to
constrain the mass profile of the cluster. In addition, we find evidence for
systematic rotation in the intracluster stars beyond 20 kpc. The surface
brightness and velocity dispersion profiles can be fit using a single component
mass model only by making unphysical assumptions about the level of anisotropy
for both the stars in the cD galaxy and for the kinematics of the galaxies in
the cluster. Two-component mass models for the cD and its halo are explored
using the kinematics of known cluster members as an additional constraint
beyond the extent of the stellar kinematics. Assuming isotropy, the observed
kinematics can be reproduced only if the halo has a soft core, i.e., Alpha < 1
(Alpha=1 is excluded due to low implied stellar mass-to-light ratios). This
result is inconsistent with the predictions of current N-body simulations with
CDM. Assuming that our best-fit mass models for the Abell 2199 were placed at
cosmological redshifts between 0.2 <= z <= 0.5, the derived tangential critical
radii range from 5'' to 40'' consistent with the strong lensing observed in
intermediate redshift clusters. We also present Monte Carlo simulations that
test the reliability of velocity dispersions when the S/N is low.

this project, the analysis is completed for a set of 19 relatively hot stars
(Teff in 6000 to 8000K range). The metallicities of the program stars are
derived by synthesizing the spectrum in the wavelength range 4900 to 5400A for
different metallicities and matching them with the observed spectra. More than
half of the candidate stars were found to show [Fe/H] in -0.7 to -1.2 range.
Two most metal-poor stars have [Fe/H] values of -1.3 and -1.8. It appears that
metal-poor candidates suggested by Beers et al. from their prismatic survey has
a very significant fraction of metal-poor stars. The significantly metal-poor
stars found so far would be studied in detail using high resolution spectra to
understand nucleosynthesis processes that might have occurred in early Galaxy.

Adding layers of a noble metal (Cu) to the Fe monolayer gives a new degree of

addition converges essentially to an addition of d states and a small

nodes, to find a minimum-weight set of edges whose removal separates all the
terminals. The problem is NP-hard, and even NP-hard to approximate within
1+delta for some small delta > 0.
  Calinescu, Karloff, and Rabani (1998) gave an algorithm with performance
guarantee 3/2-1/k, based on a geometric relaxation of the problem. In this
paper, we give improved randomized rounding schemes for their relaxation,
yielding a 12/11-approximation algorithm for k=3 and a 1.3438-approximation
algorithm in general.
  Our approach hinges on the observation that the problem of designing a
randomized rounding scheme for a geometric relaxation is itself a linear
programming problem. The paper explores computational solutions to this
problem, and gives a proof that for a general class of geometric relaxations,
there are always randomized rounding schemes that match the integrality gap.

guarantees that the number densities of u, d, and s quarks in the
Color-Flavor-Locked (CFL) phase will be equal even with physical current quark
masses. Electric charge neutrality follows as a consequence and without the
presence of electrons. In contrast, electric charge neutrality in the less
symmetric 2-flavor superconducting (2SC) phase with ud pairing requires more
electrons than the normal quark phase. The free energy density cost of
enforcing color and electric charge neutrality in the CFL phase is lower than
that in the 2SC phase, which favors the formation of the CFL phase. With
increasing temperature and neutrino content, an unlocking transition occurs
from the CFL phase to the 2SC phase with the order of the transition depending
on the temperature, the quark and lepton number chemical potentials. The
astrophysical implications of this rich structure in the phase diagram,

minimal list of superfields incorporating the Standard Model particles, and a
Lagrangian dictated by the Standard Model gauge symmetries. To be
phenomenologically viable, soft supersymmetry breaking terms have to be
included. In the most popular version of the supersymmetric Standard Model, an
{\it ad hoc} discrete symmetry, called R parity, is added in by hand. While
there has been a lot of various kinds of R-parity violation studies in the
literature, the complete version of supersymmetry without R parity is not
popularly appreciated. In this article, we present a pedagogical review of the
formulation of this generic supersymmetric Standard Model and give a detailed
discussion on the basic conceptual issues involved. Unfortunately, there are
quite some confusing, or even plainly wrong, statements on the issues within
the literature of R-parity violations. We aim at clarifying these issues here.
We will first discuss our formulation, about which readers are urged to read
without bias from previous acquired perspectives on the topic. Based on the
formulation, we will then address the various issues . In relation to
phenomenology, our review here will not go beyond tree-level mass matrices. But
we will give a careful discussion of mass matrices of all the matter fields
involved. Useful expressions for perturbative diagonalizations of the mass
matrices at the phenomenologically interesting limit of corresponds to small
neutrino masses are derived. All these expressions are given in the fully
generic setting, with information on complex phases of parameters retained.
Such expressions have been shown to be useful in the analyses of various
phenomenological features.

external field applied along the quantization axis creates a network of well
separated level crossings in the energy diagram of the collective states. One
or more transverse pulsed fields applied at the times of specific level
crossings induce adiabatic passage between these states. By choosing the timing
