selected 7CRS sample contains all sources with flux-densities S_151 > 0.5 Jy in
three regions of the sky; 7C-I and 7C-II were chosen to overlap with the 5C6

sample has been completely identified and spectroscopy of the quasars and
broad-lined radio galaxies has been presented in Willott et al. (1998). Only
seven of the radio galaxies do not have redshift determinations from the
spectroscopy, giving a redshift completeness for the sample of >90%. The median
redshift of the 7CRS is 1.1. We present a composite 0.2<z<0.8 7CRS radio galaxy
spectrum and investigate the strengths of the 4000 Angstrom breaks in these

strength and emission line luminosity, indicating that departures from old
elliptical galaxy continuum shapes are most likely due to non-stellar emission
associated with the active nucleus.

the 1.3-kpc diameter superbubble of NGC 3079 have strikingly similar patterns
at 0.""8 resolution. This tight match seems to arise from cool disk gas that has
been driven by the wind, with X-rays being emitted from upstream, stand-off
bowshocks or by conductive cooling at the cloud/wind interfaces. We find that
the soft X-ray plasma has thermal and kinetic energies of
$2\times10^{56}\sqrt{\eta_x}$ and $5\times10^{54}\sqrt{\eta_X}$ erg
respectively, where $\eta_X$ is the filling factor of the X-ray gas and may be
small; these are comparable to the energies of the optical line-emitting gas.
X-rays are also seen from the base of the radio counterbubble that is obscured
optically by the galaxy disk, and from the nucleus (whose spectrum shows the Fe
K$\alpha$ line). Hydrodynamical simulations reproduce the obbservations well
using large filling factors within both filament systems; assuming otherwise
seriously underestimates the mass loss in the superwind. The superbubble is
surrounded by a fainter conical halo of X-rays that fill the area delineated by
high angle, H$\alpha$-emitting filaments, supporting our previous assertion
that these filaments form the contact discontinuity/shock between galaxy gas
and shocked wind. About 40\arcsec (3 kpc) above the disk, an X-ray arc may
partially close beyond the bubble, but the north-east quadrant remains open,
consistent with the superwind having broken out into at least the galaxy halo.

metal-poor double-lined binary system HD 195987, with an orbital period of 57.3

2% and 1%, respectively. We also determine the orbital parallax, pi(orb) =
46.08 +/- 0.27 mas, corresponding to a distance of 21.70 +/- 0.13 pc. The
parallax and the measured brightness difference between the stars in V, H, and
K yield the component absolute magnitudes in those bands. We also estimate the
effective temperatures of the stars as Teff(A) = 5200 +/- 100 K and Teff(B) =
4200 +/- 200 K. Together with detailed chemical abundance analyses from the

find that no single model fits all observed properties at the measured

(galaxy-)density-ellipticity correlation function, the latter done using
current analytic theories of tidal alignment. The gravitational lensing
contribution has two components: one is analogous to galaxy-galaxy lensing and
the other arises from magnification bias -- that gravitational lensing induces
a modulation of the galaxy density as well as ellipticity. On the other hand,
the intrinsic alignment contribution vanishes, even after taking into account
source clustering corrections, which suggests the density-ellipticity
correlation might be an interesting diagnostic in differentiating between
intrinsic and extrinsic alignments. {\it However}, an important assumption,
commonly adopted by current analytic alignment theories, is the Gaussianity of
the tidal field. Inevitable non-Gaussian fluctuations from gravitational
instability induces a non-zero intrinsic density-ellipticity correlation, which
we estimate. We also argue that non-Gaussian contributions to the intrinsic
{\it ellipticity-ellipticity} correlation are often non-negligible. This leads
to a linear rather than, as is commonly assumed, quadratic scaling with the
power spectrum on sufficiently large scales. Finally, we estimate the
contribution of intrinsic alignment to low redshift galaxy-galaxy lensing
measurements (e.g. SDSS), due to the partial overlap between foreground and
background galaxies: the intrinsic contamination is about 10 - 30 % at 10'.
Uncertainties in this estimate are discussed.

it is possible that the system is participating in the 7:3 mean motion
resonance. We show that stability considerations restrict the mutual
inclination between the two planets to 40 degrees or less, and that this result
is relatively insensitive to the total mass of the two planets. We present
hydrodynamical simulations which measure the torques exerted on the planets by
a hypothesized external protoplanetary disk. We show that planetary migration
in response to torques from the disk may have led to capture of the system into
a 7:3 mean-motion resonance, although it is unclear how the eccentricities of

Earth-mass planets can survive for long periods in some regions of the

been unprecedented in a WR star. The optical quasi-period (~241 d) is in almost
perfect agreement with the interferometric period (243.5+/-3 d). The remarkable
agreement of the dominant period in optical variability with the orbital period
supports that the strongly varying dust obscuration is physically related to
the binary motion, rather than sporadic dust-forming episodes. Considering the
low orbital inclination (11+/-7 deg) and the nearly circular orbit inferred
from the interferometric observations, the strongly variable line-of-sight
extinction suggests that the highly structured extinction can be being formed
via an ejection of dust in the direction of the binary rotation axis. Another
viable explanation is that the three-dimensional structure of the shock front,
itself is the obscuring body. Depending on the geometry, the dusty shock front

from the observed z-distributions of faint hard X-ray sources -- showing large
excesses at redshifts (z~0.8) much lower than expected by the synthesis models
-- and from their X/optical/IR SEDs combined with the IR counts of type-II
AGNs. Our analysis, although supporting the general scheme which interprets the
XRB as due to absorbed AGNs with broad N_H distributions, requires major
revision of the other postulate of the XRB synthesis models: the AGN
unification. We argue that the unification scheme based on a simple orientation
effect fails at high redshifts, where galaxy activity is induced by strong
interactions and mergers among gas-rich systems. This helps explaining the
observational evidence that type-I and II AGNs follow different evolutionary
patterns, with type-I quasars providing a very biased trace of this activity.
Combined deep X-ray and IR surveys consistently find that the universe has
experienced a violent phase of galaxy activity around z~1, probably related
with the assembly of massive galaxies, involving both SF and obscured AGN
fueling. Roughly 10 to 20% of this activity has involved substantial AGN
emission, this fraction likely reflecting the AGN/starburst duty cycle during
the activation phase.

outer disk of our nearest large galactic neighbour, M31. Our deep panoramic
survey with the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Camera currently maps out an
area of ~25 square degrees around M31, extending along the semi-major axis to
55 kpc, and is the first to allow an uninterrupted study of the density and
color distribution of individual red giant branch stars across a large fraction
of the halo of an external spiral galaxy. We find evidence for both spatial
density and metallicity (as inferred from colour information) variations, which
are often, but not always, correlated. In addition to the previously reported
giant stellar stream (Ibata 2001b), the data reveal the presence of significant
stellar overdensities at large radii close to the south-western major axis, in
the proximity of the very luminous globular cluster G1, and near the
north-eastern major axis, coinciding with and extending beyond the
previously-known `northern spur'. The most prominent metallicity variations are
found in the southern half of the halo, where two large structures with above
average metallicites are apparent; one of these coincides with the giant
stellar stream while the other corresponds to a much lower-level stellar
enhancement. Our findings contrast with, but do not conflict with, past studies
of the M31 halo and outer disk which have suggested a rather homogeneous
stellar population at large radius: the bulk of our newly-detected substructure
lies in the previously-uncharted far outer regions of the galaxy. We discuss
the possible origin of the substructure observed and the implications it has
for constraining the galaxy assembly process.

occupy a significant fraction of local galaxies. Their spectra differ
significantly from the canonical luminous AGNs, most notably by the absence of
the ``big blue bump''. In the present paper, taking a typical
LLAGN--NGC4258--as an example, we investigate the origin of their spectral
emission. The observational data of NGC4258 is extremely abundant, including
water maser emission, putting very strict constraints to its theoretical
models. The infrared (IR) spectrum is well described by a steep power-law form
$f_{\nu}\propto \nu^{-1.4}$, and may extend to the optical/UV band. Up until
now there is no model which can explain such a steep spectrum, and we here
propose a coupled jet plus accretion disk model for NGC4258. The accretion disk
is composed of an inner ADAF (or radiatively inefficient accretion flow) and an
outer standard thin disk. A shock occurs when the accretion flow is ejected out
of the ADAF to form the jet near the black hole, accelerating the electrons
into a power-law energy distribution. The synchrotron and self-Comptonized
emission from these electrons greatly dominates over the underlying accretion
disk and can well explain the spectrum ranging from IR to X-ray bands. The
further propagation of the shocked gas in the jet can explain the flat radio
spectrum of NGC4258. Several predictions of our model are presented for testing
against future observations, and we briefly discuss the application of the
model to other LLAGNs.

observations of the cool ZZ Ceti star HS 0507+0434B. Ten independent
frequencies are detected in the star's light variations: one singlet and three
nearly-equally spaced triplets. We argue that these triplets are due to
rotationally split modes of spherical degree l=1. This is the first detection
of consistent multiplet structure in the amplitude spectrum of a cool ZZ Ceti
star and it allows us to determine the star's rotation period: 1.70 +/- 0.11 d.
  We report exactly equal frequency, not period, spacings between the detected
mode groups. In addition, certain pairs of modes from the four principal groups
have frequency ratios which are very close to 3:4 or 4:5; while these ratios
are nearly exact (within one part in 10^4), they still lie outside the computed
error bars. We speculate that these relationships between different frequencies
could be caused by resonances. One of the three triplets may not be constant in
amplitude and/or frequency.
  We compare our frequency solution for the combination frequencies (of which
we detected 38) to Wu's (1998, 2001) model thereof. We obtain consistent
results when trying to infer the star's convective thermal time and the
inclination angle of its rotational axis. Theoretical combination-frequency
amplitude spectra also resemble those of the observations well, and direct
theoretical predictions of the observed second-order light-curve distortions
were also reasonably successful assuming the three triplets are due to l=1

possible l=2 identifications for the triplets did not provide similarly
consistent results, supporting their identification with l=1.

the entire range 10^{-5} - 10^26 cm -- may contain ordinary matter in a fractal
condensed form like that in the above-mentioned dust skeletons and hail

facts (Hubble's expansion and cosmic microwave background) is suggested. Our
former hypotheses (and the respective proof-of-concept studies) for the
probable microscopic mechanisms of skeleton's assembling, chemical composition,

major cosmological implication is that the purely gravitational description of

self-assembled from tubular nanostructures (carbon nanotubes or similar
nanostructures of other chemical elements).

power law with a photon index of 1.9 to 2.1), a multicolor accretion disk
blackbody component with a temperature just below 1 keV and a broad emission
line at about 6 keV. The spectrum is heavily absorbed by cold interstellar
matter with an equivalent hydrogen column density of 2.5 X 10+22 cm-2, which
makes it difficult to study the black body component in detail. The black body
component exhibits strong evolution about 6 weeks into the outburst. Two weeks
later this is followed by a swift decay of the power law component. The
broadness of the 6 keV feature may be due to relativistic broadening or Compton
scattering of a narrow Fe-K line.

strong tunneling regime, by reducing the magnitude of the Luttinger parameter
$K$, leading to the appearance of a zero-bias differential conductance peak of
magnitude $G_t=Ke^2/h$ at zero temperature. The abrupt appearance of the zero
bias peak as the filling factor is increased past a value $ \nu^* \gtrsim 1$,
and its gradual disappearance thereafter can be understood as a crossover
controlled by the main energy scales of this system: the bias voltage $V$, the
crossover scale $T_K$, and the temperature $T$. The low height of the zero bias
peak $\sim 0.1e^2/h$ observed in the experiment, and its broad finite width,
can be understood naturally within this picture. Also, the abrupt reappearance
of the zero-bias peak for $\nu \gtrsim 2$ can be explained as an effect caused
by spin reversed electrons, \textit{i. e.} if the 2DEG is assumed to have a
small polarization near $\nu\sim2$. We also predict that as the temperature is
lowered $\nu^*$ should decrease, and the width of zero-bias peak should become
wider. This picture also predicts the existence of similar zero bias peak in

complex hydrodynamic phenomena, ranging from slow flows in grossly irregular
geometries to fully developed turbulence, to flows with dynamic phase
transitions. Besides their practical value as efficient computational tools for
the dynamics complex systems, these minimal models may also represent a new
conceptual paradigm in modern computational statistical mechanics: instead of
proceeding bottom-up from the underlying microdynamic systems, these minimal
kinetic models are built top-down starting from the macroscopic target
equations. This procedure can provide dramatic advantages, provided the
essential physics is not lost along the way. For dissipative systems, one such
essential requirement is the compliance with the Second Law of thermodynamics.
In this Colloquium, we present a chronological survey of the main ideas behind
the Lattice Boltzmann method, with special focus on the role played by the $H$
theorem in enforcing compliance of the method with macroscopic evolutionary
constraints (Second Law) as well as in serving as a numerically stable
computational tool for fluid flows and other dissipative systems out of

the surface to reconstruct into a pattern of FCC and HCP domains, as has been
shown experimentally. The top layer is very slightly rotated relative to the
substrate, resulting in the formation of ""rotors"" at intersections of domain
walls. The size and shape of domains is very sensitive to the density in the
top layer, the chemical potential, and the angle of rotation, with a smooth and

it leads to an additional modulation of the current amplitudes excited by an
applied biharmonic electric field with harmonic components polarized in
orthogonal directions. Furthermore, we show that self-induced transparency and

displaced in time from each other, and, in general, they arise at different

preference aggregation is a central issue. Voting is a general method for
preference aggregation, but seminal results have shown that all general voting
protocols are manipulable. One could try to avoid manipulation by using voting
protocols where determining a beneficial manipulation is hard. Especially among
computational agents, it is reasonable to measure this hardness by
computational complexity. Some earlier work has been done in this area, but it
was assumed that the number of voters and candidates is unbounded. We derive
hardness results for practical multiagent settings where the number of
candidates is small but the number of voters can be large. We show that with
complete information about the others' votes, individual manipulation is easy,
and coalitional manipulation is easy with unweighted voters. However,
constructive coalitional manipulation with weighted voters is intractable for
all of the voting protocols under study, except for the nonrandomized Cup.
Destructive manipulation tends to be easier. Randomizing over instantiations of
the protocols (such as schedules of the Cup protocol) can be used to make
manipulation hard. Finally, we show that under weak assumptions, if weighted
coalitional manipulation with complete information about the others' votes is
hard in some voting protocol, then individual and unweighted manipulation is
hard when there is uncertainty about the others' votes.

extend the analysis to gauge field theories on the lattice. We consider a
complete canonical formulation, starting from a discrete action, for lattice

and time. After completing the treatment, the results can be shown to coincide
with the results of the traditional transfer matrix method. We then apply the
method to BF theory, yielding the first lattice treatment for such a theory

"gr-qc/0205125","Giovanni Amelino-Camelia","Giovanni Amelino-Camelia","On the fate of Lorentz symmetry in loop quantum gravity and
  noncommutative spacetimes","59 pages, LaTex",,,,"gr-qc",,"  I analyze the deformation of Lorentz symmetry that holds in certain
noncommutative spacetimes and the way in which Lorentz symmetry is broken in
other noncommutative spacetimes. I also observe that discretization of areas
does not necessarily require departures from Lorentz symmetry. This is due to
the fact that Lorentz symmetry has no implications for exclusive measurement of
the area of a surface, but it governs the combined measurements of the area and
the velocity of a surface. In a quantum-gravity theory Lorentz symmetry can be
consistent with area discretization, but only when the observables ``area of
the surface"" and ""velocity of the surface"" enjoy certain special properties. I
argue that the status of Lorentz symmetry in the loop-quantum-gravity approach
requires careful scrutiny, since areas are discretized within a formalism that,
at least presently, does not include an observable ""velocity of the surface"".
In general it may prove to be very difficult to reconcile Lorentz symmetry with
area discretization in theories of canonical quantization of gravity, because a
proper description of Lorentz symmetry appears to require that the
fundamental/primary role be played by the surface's world-sheet, whose
""projection"" along the space directions of a given observer describes the
observable area, whereas the canonical formalism only allows the introduction
as primary entities of observables defined at a fixed (common) time, and the
observers that can be considered must share that time variable.

that vortices are not created from thermal fluctuations in the Ginzburg regime.

on a constant skew-symmetric three-form parameter. In 3+1 dimensions such a
three-form parameter can be viewed as a short-distance regulator which
nevertheless preserves spatial-rotation and at long range preserves Lorentz
invariance approximately. For a scalar field theory with quartic
self-interaction we obtain drastically improved ultra-violet behavior of the
diagrams, due to the oscillatory dependence of the interaction vertex on the
momenta. The radiative corrections to the coupling are rendered finite already
at the one-loop level. The key finding of this paper is that what appears as
the reemergence of UV divergences as IR singularity in $p \to 0$ limit, must be
interpreted simply as the logarithmic running of the coupling. Thus at low
energies the theory is virtually indistinguishable from the standard theory.
Conversely at high energies the diagram converges exponentially fast, the
running of the coupling stops and the theory avoids developing the Landau pole.
Bare coupling defined at high energy can be kept small, and in this sense the
theory is similar to asymptotically free theories.

transient phenomena with relaxation times of order of the Age of the Universe.
An interesting feature of the approach is the absence of a cosmic horizon,
thereby allowing for a proper definition of an S-matrix.As a result of the

a linear Randall-Sundrum solution and a (logarithmic) dilatonic domain wall
(bulk naked singularity).We pay particular attention to examining the
possibility of resolving the mass hierarchy problem together with the vanishing
of the vacuum energy on the observable world, which is taken to be a positive
tension brane. The appearance of naked dilatonic domain walls provides a
dynamical restriction of the bulk space time. Of particular interest is a
dilatonic-wall solution, which after appropriate coordinate transformation,
results in a linear dilaton conformal field theory. The latter may provide a
holographic resolution of the naked singularity problem. All the
string-inspired models involved have the generic feature that the brane
tensions are proportional to the string coupling $g_s$; it remains a challenge
for string theory, therefore, to show whether microscopic models respecting

and 11Li, respectively. The results show that degrees of freedom of the pairing
correlation in 9Li play an important role in the structure of 10Li and 11Li. In
10Li, the pairing correlation in 9Li produces a so-called pairing-blocking
effect due to the presence of valence neutron, which degenerates s- and p-wave
neutron orbits energetically. In 11Li, on the other hand, the pairing-blocking
effect is surpassed by the core-n interaction due to two degrees of freedom of
two valence neutrons surrounding 9Li, and as a result, the ground state is
dominated by the p-shell closed configuration and does not show a spatial
extension with a large r.m.s. radius. These results indicate that the pairing
correlation is realized differently in odd- and even-neutron systems of 10Li
and 11Li. We further improve the tail part of the 9Li-n interaction, which
works well to reproduce the observed large r.m.s. radius in 11Li.
