To this aim, the following steps are followed: (1) First, we re-write the
formalism for converting synthetic stellar spectra into tables of bolometric
corrections. The resulting formulas can be applied to any photometric system,
provided that the zero-points are specified by means of either ABmag, STmag,
VEGAmag, or a standard star system that includes well-known spectrophotometric
standards. Interstellar absorption can be considered in a self-consistent way.
(2) We assemble an extended and updated library of stellar intrinsic spectra.
It is mostly based on non-overshooting ATLAS9 models, suitably extended to both
low and high effective temperatures. This offers an excellent coverage of the
parameter space of Teff, logg, and [M/H]. We briefly discuss the main
uncertainties and points still deserving more improvement. (3) From the
spectral library, we derive tables of bolometric corrections for
Johnson-Cousins-Glass, HST/WFPC2, HST/NICMOS, Washington, and ESO Imaging
Survey systems (this latter consisting on the WFI, EMMI, and SOFI filter sets).
(4) These tables are used to convert several sets of Padova isochrones into the
corresponding absolute magnitudes and colours, thus providing a useful database
for several astrophysical applications. All data files are made available in
electronic form.

distributions observed by IRAS and ISO from 3 to 100 microns. However,
predictions based on the first generation models at longer wavelengths (122 to

f_nu(60 microns)/f_nu(100 microns), or alternatively, for weaker global

to provide a more accurate relation between infrared luminosity and dust mass.

color-magnitude diagrams that reach to V = 30, I = 28. The cluster main

potential cluster stars to lower luminosity all the way down to our limiting
magnitudes. These latter objects are significantly redder than any known
metal-poor field subdwarf. Comparison with the current generation of

have performed an HI and optical study of this nearly face-on galaxy. We find
that the nuclear ring might in fact be part of an inner one-armed spiral, that
could be driving nuclear accretion and feeding the central activity in the
inner kpc. The inner ring is faint, and the outer ring is a rather ill-defined
pseudoring. Furthermore, the size ratio of the rings is such that they cannot
be due to a single pattern speed linking them together.
  The outer pseudoring is peculiar, since it lies in the faint outer parts of
the disk, where star formation is still going on at 1.4 times the optical
radius. Higher HI column densities are associated with these regions and the
atomic gas layer is warped. These perturbations affect only the outer disk,
since the kinematics within the main body conforms well to an ordinary
differentially rotating disk.
  We propose here that both nuclear activity and star formation in the warped
outer parts might be linked to the fact that NGC 3642 is located in a rich
environment, where its close neighbors show clear signs of merging. Our
suggestion is that NGC 3642 has captured recently a low-mass, gas-rich dwarf,
and star formation was triggered in this infalling external gas that produced
also a pronounced warp in the gaseous disk.

is often attributed to the orbital motion of a central binary black hole
system. On this basis, and assuming a circular orbit, Rieger and Mannheim have
recently proposed a method to determine the orbital parameters of the binary
system from the observed quantities, {\it i.e.} the signal periodicity, the
flux ratio between maximum and minimum signal and the power law spectral index
of the photon flux. However, since these binary black holes are expected to
originate from galactic mergers, they could well be on eccentric orbits, which
might not circularize for a substantial time. We therefore generalize the
treatment proposed by Rieger and Mannheim by taking into account the effect of
the orbital eccentricity of the binary system. We apply the model to three
well-observed Markarian objects: MKN 501, MKN 421 and MKN 766 that most likely
host a binary system in their centers. Some astrophysical implications of this

observations are not sufficient on their own to determine the equation of state
of the dark energy, due to the effect of the so-called geometric degeneracy at
large multipoles and the cosmic variance at small ones. In contrast, we find
that CMB data can put tight constraints on another fundamental property of the
dark energy, namely its coupling to dark matter. We compare the current
high-resolution CMB data to models of dark energy characterized by an inverse
power law or exponential potential and by the coupling to dark matter. We
determine the curve of degeneracy between the dark energy equation of state and
the dimensionless Hubble parameter h and show that even an independent perfect
determination of h may be insufficient to distinguish dark energy from a pure
cosmological constant with the current dataset. On the other hand, we find that
the interaction with dark matter is firmly bounded, regardless of the
potential. In terms of the dimensionless ratio \beta of the dark energy
interaction to gravity, we find \beta <0.16 (95% c.l.). This implies that the
effective equation of state between equivalence and tracking has been close to
the pure matter equation of state within 1% and that scalar gravity is at least
40 times weaker than tensor gravity. Further, we show that an experiment
limited by cosmic variance only, like the Planck mission, can put an upper
bound \beta < 0.05 (95% c.l.). This shows that CMB observations have a strong
potentiality not only as a test of cosmic kinematics but also as a
gravitational probe.

enters the envelope of a giant star. I show that in some binary systems under a

mass at the onset of the common envelope implies that the binary system emerges
from the common envelope with a relatively large orbital separation. I
therefore caution against a simple treatment, which omits this process, in the
study of systems that evolved through a common envelope phase and ended with a
relatively large orbital separation, e.g., PG1115+166. A fraction of the
envelope that is lost while the companion is still outside the giant stellar
envelope is accreted by the companion. The companion may form an accretion disk
and blow two jets. I propose this scenario for the formation of the bipolar
planetary nebula NGC 2346, which has a binary nucleus with an orbital period
longer than that of any other known binary system in planetary nebulae. Because
this scenario, of a late common envelope phase, occurs for a narrow range of
parameters, I expect it to be applicable to a small, but non-negligible, number
of systems.

of periodically repeated Sierpinski gaskets. These model superconductors share
essential geometrical features with truly random (percolative) systems. When
exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field B, their euclidian or fractal
behavior depends on the relation between the intervortex distance (imposed by
B) and the size of a constituent gasket, and was explored with high-resolution
measurements of the sample magnetoinductance L(B). In terms of the frustration
parameter f expressing (in units of the superconducting flux quantum) the
magnetic flux threading an elementary triangular cell of a gasket, the
crossover between the two regimes occurs at f_{cN}=1/(2*4^{N}), where N is the
gasket order. In the fractal regime (f>f_{cN}) a sequence of equally spaced
structures corresponding to the set of states with unit cells not larger than a
single gasket is observed at multiples of f_{cN}, as predicted by theory. The
fine structure of L(f) radically changes in the euclidian regime (f<f_{cN}),
where it is determined by the commensurability of the vortex lattice with the
effective potential created by the array. Anomalies observed in both the
periodicity and the symmetry of L(f) are attributed to the effect of a hidden
incommensurability, which arises from the deformation of the magnetic field
distribution caused by the asymmetric diamagnetic response of the
superconducting islands forming the arrays.

cause the statics and driven dynamics to differ at 2-loop order. We obtain the

all disorder of shorter range. It also shows that the conjecture zeta=epsilon/3

diverge very slowly at zero separation. As a consequence, the fluid phases have
unusual characteristics, including anomalous pair correlations and mean-field
like thermodynamic behaviour. The solid phases can exhibit exotic, strongly
anisotropic as well as open crystal structures. For example, the diamond and
the A15-phase are shown to be stable at sufficiently high concentrations.
Reentrant melting and clustering transitions are additional features displayed
by such systems, resulting in phase diagrams with a very rich topology. We
emphasise that many of these effects are fundamentally different from the usual
archetypal hard sphere paradigm. Instead, we propose that these fluids fall
into the class of mean-field fluids.

embarrassing paradox. The key observation is that the effect of noise strongly
depends on the ratio r = n/T, where n is the size of the portfolio and T the
length of the available time series. On the basis of numerical experiments and
analytic results for some toy portfolio models we show that for relatively
large values of r (e.g. 0.6) noise does, indeed, have the pronounced effect
suggested by [1,2,3] and illustrated later by [4,5] in a portfolio optimization
context, while for smaller r (around 0.2 or below), the error due to noise
drops to acceptable levels. Since the length of available time series is for
obvious reasons limited in any practical application, any bound imposed on the
noise-induced error translates into a bound on the size of the portfolio. In a
related set of experiments we find that the effect of noise depends also on
whether the problem arises in asset allocation or in a risk measurement
context: if covariance matrices are used simply for measuring the risk of
portfolios with a fixed composition rather than as inputs to optimization, the
effect of noise on the measured risk may become very small.

questions of ultra-high energy neutrino interactions. There is currently great
interest in neutrino interactions caused by low-scale, extra dimension models.
Above 1 PeV the cross section in low scale gravity models rises well above the
total Standard Model cross section. We assess the observability of this effect
in the 1 PeV - 100 PeV energy range of kilometer-scale detectors with several
new points of emphasis that hinge on enhanced neutral current cross sections. A
major point is the importance of ``feed-down'' regeneration of upward neutrino
flux, driven by new-physics neutral current interactions in the flux evolution
equations. Feed-down is far from negligible, and it is essential to include its
effect. We then find that the angular distribution of events has high
discriminating value in separating models. In particular the ``up-to-down''
ratio between upward and downward-moving neutrino fluxes is a practical
diagnostic tool which can discriminate between models in the near future. The
slope of the angular distribution, in the region of maximum detected flux, is
also substantially different in low-scale gravity and the Standard Model. These
observables are only weakly dependent on astrophysical flux uncertainties. We
conclude that angular distributions can reveal a breakdown of the Standard
Model and probe the new physics beyond, as soon as data become available.

$\phi_{CC}/\phi_{NC}=0.34^{+0.05}_{-0.04},$ which is nominally $\sim 30\sigma$

compatible with an important fraction of sterile component in the solar beam

we determine individual neutrino mixing parameters and their errors in the

hybrid inflation, showing that in this case the coupling of the moduli to the
field which forms the string network has to be much weaker than the typical

Alternatively, if the relevant coupling is of gravitational order, an upper
bound of about 10^13 GeV is imposed on the string energy scale.

considering (a commonly used) example of a simple local quadratic epsilon

might be nonperturbatively renormalizable, the exact renormalization group
equation of QEG is evaluated in a truncation of theory space which generalizes
the Einstein-Hilbert truncation by the inclusion of a higher-derivative term
$(R^2)$. The beta-functions describing the renormalization group flow of the
cosmological constant, Newton's constant, and the $R^2$-coupling are computed
explicitly. The fixed point (FP) properties of the 3-dimensional flow are
investigated, and they are confronted with those of the 2-dimensional
Einstein-Hilbert flow. The non-Gaussian FP predicted by the latter is found to
generalize to a FP on the enlarged theory space. In order to test the
reliability of the $R^2$-truncation near this FP we analyze the residual scheme
dependence of various universal quantities; it turns out to be very weak. The
two truncations are compared in detail, and their numerical predictions are
found to agree with a suprisingly high precision. Due to the consistency of the
results it appears increasingly unlikely that the non-Gaussian FP is an
artifact of the truncation. If it is present in the exact theory QEG is
probably nonperturbatively renormalizable and ``asymptotically safe''. We
discuss how the conformal factor problem of Euclidean gravity manifests itself
in the exact renormalization group approach and show that, in the
$R^2$-truncation, the investigation of the FP is not afflicted with this
problem. Also the Gaussian FP of the Einstein-Hilbert truncation is analyzed;
it turns out that it does not generalize to a corresponding FP on the enlarged
theory space.

T-geometry is described in terms of finite point subspaces and world function
between pairs of points of these subsets, i.e. in the language which is
immanent to geometry and free of external means of description (coordinates,
curves). Such a description appears to be simple and effective even in the case
of complicated T-geometry. Antisymmetric component of the world function
generates appearance of additional metric fields. This leads to appearance of
three sorts of Christoffel symbols and three sorts of geodesics. Three sorts of
the first order tubes (future, past and neutral) appear. If the fields
connected with the antisymmetric component are strong enough, the timelike
first order tube has a finite length in the timelike direction. It was shown
earler that the symmetric T-geometry explains non-relativistic quantum effects

closed strings. Antisymmetry is associated with supersymmetry. Three sorts of

reduction process in relativistic quantum mechanics. The basic problem for a
covariant description is the dependence of the states on the frame within which
collapse takes place. A suitable use of the causal structure of the devices
involved in the measurement process allowed us to introduce a covariant notion
for the collapse of quantum states. However, a fully consistent description in
the relativistic domain requires the extension of the interpretation to quantum
fields. The extension is far from straightforward. Besides the obvious
difficulty of dealing with the infinite degrees of freedom of the field theory,
one has to analyze the restrictions imposed by causality concerning the allowed
operations in a measurement process. In this paper we address these issues. We
shall show that, in the case of partial causally connected measurements, our
description allows us to include a wider class of causal operations than the
one resulting from the standard way for computing conditional probabilities.
This alternative description could be experimentally tested. A verification of
this proposal would give a stronger support to the realistic interpretations of
the states in quantum mechanics.

rather than physical and that quantum mechanical predictions should be viewed
as logical inferences made on the basis of the information content of a given
experimental situation. By implementing such a viewpoint, it is possible to
maintain a sharp distinction between the physical and statistical aspects of
quantum mechanics. The idea is applied to the double-beam interference
experiment, reproducing the results of the standard formulation of quantum
mechanics in a manner that renders the notion of wave-particle duality
superfluous.

in a cavity suited for second-harmonic generation. The evanescent wave coupling
between the waveguides is considered as weak, and the interplay between this
coupling and the nonlinear interaction within the waveguides gives rise to
quantum violations of the classical limit. These violations are particularly
strong when two instabilities are competing, where twin-beam behavior is found
as almost complete noise suppression in the difference of the fundamental
intensities. Moreover, close to bistable transitions perfect twin-beam
correlations are seen in the sum of the fundamental intensities, and also the
self-pulsing instability as well as the transition from symmetric to asymmetric
states display nonclassical twin-beam correlations of both fundamental and
second-harmonic intensities. The results are based on the full quantum Langevin
equations derived from the Hamiltonian and including cavity damping effects.
The intensity correlations of the output fields are calculated
semi-analytically using a linearized version of the Langevin equations derived
through the positive-P representation. Confirmation of the analytical results
are obtained by numerical simulations of the nonlinear Langevin equations
derived using the truncated Wigner representation.

that highly entangled states, approximating the MES with a good accuracy, can
