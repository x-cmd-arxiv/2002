high frequency, the conal components exhibit almost constant widths. We use all

fitted by a relationship introduced by Thorsett (1991), but the resulting
parameters are highly correlated. Three different types of behavior are found:
one group of stars exhibits a continuous variation of beam radius which can be
extrapolated down to the stellar surface along the ``last open field lines''; a
second group exhibits beam radii which asymptotically approach a minimum high
frequency value that is 3--5 times larger; and a third set shows almost no
spectral change in beam radius at all. The first two behaviors are associated
with outer-cone component pairs; whereas the constant separation appears to
reflect inner-cone emission.

the Andromeda VI anomalous Cepheids have properties consistent with those of
anomalous Cepheids in other dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We revise the existing
period-luminosity relations for these variables. Further, using these and other
available data, we show that there is no clear difference between fundamental
and first-overtone anomalous Cepheids in a period-amplitude diagram at shorter
periods, unlike the RR Lyrae. For the Andromeda VI RR Lyrae, we find that they
lie close to the Oosterhoff type I Galactic globular clusters in the
period-amplitude diagram, although the mean period of the RRab stars, <P_ab> =
0.588 d, is slightly longer than the typical Oosterhoff type I cluster. The
mean V magnitude of the RR Lyrae in Andromeda VI is 25.29+/-0.03, resulting in
a distance 815+/-25 kpc on the Lee, Demarque, & Zinn distance scale. This is
consistent with the distance derived from the I magnitude of the tip of the red

abundance for Andromeda VI which is consistent with that derived from the mean

extracted from circular annuli reveals that a two-temperature model (2T) of the
hot gas is favored over single-phase or cooling flow (M_dot = 4.5 +/- 0.2
M_{sun}/yr) models within the central ~30 kpc. Alternatively, the data can be
fit equally well if the temperature within each spherical shell varies
continuously from ~T_h to T_c ~ T_h/2, but no lower. The high spatial
resolution of the Chandra data allows us to determine that the temperature
excursion T_h --> T_c required in each shell exceeds the temperature range
between the boundaries of the same shell in the best-fitting single-phase
model. This is strong evidence for a multi-phase gas having a limited
temperature range. The cooler component of the 2T model has a temperature (T_c
\~ 0.7 keV) similar to the kinetic temperature of the stars. The hot phase has
a temperature (T_h ~ 1.4 keV) characteristic of the virial temperature of the
\~10^{13} M_{sun} halo expected in the NGC 5044 group. However, in view of the
morphological disturbances and X-ray holes visible in the Chandra image within
R ~10 kpc, bubbles of gas heated to ~T_h in this region may be formed by
intermittent AGN feedback. Some additional heating at larger radii may be
associated with the evolution of the cold front near R ~50 kpc, as suggested by
the sharp edge in the EPIC images.

mass-transfer remained even at the deepest minimum of the fading, contrary to
what was observed in a deep minimum of a VY Scl-type star, MV Lyr. RX And
subsequently underwent a brightening (outburst) during its recovery stage. The
photometric and spectroscopic characteristics of the brightening significantly
differed from those of ordinary outbursts of RX And, and are considered to
resemble an inside-out type outburst of a long-period dwarf nova. An
examination of historical visual observations revealed the possible presence of
\~10-yr periodicity, which is close to what has been proposed for MV Lyr. The
common observed features between RX And and VY Scl-type stars may suggest a
common underlying mechanism for producing temporary deep fadings. The departure
from the disk instability model, as observed in VY Scl-type stars, was not
apparent in the present fading of RX And. In conjunction with the recently
published Hubble Space Telescope observation during the same fading, we can
conclude that the phenomenological difference from the VY Scl-type fading is
understood as a smaller effect of irradiation on the accretion disk in RX And.

dwarf 2MASSW J1145572+231730 to identify the cause of photospheric variability
in ultra cool dwarfs. Plausible candidates are magnetically-induced star spots
and inhomogeneous photospheric dust clouds. Based on the atmospheric models and
synthetic spectra of Allard et al. (2001), the expected signatures of these
phenomena in the 0.5-2.5 um wavelength region are presented and discussed. Near
infrared spectra of 2M1145 were obtained along with a nearby reference star
observed simultaneously in the spectrograph slit. No convincing variability
over a 54 hour interval is found in any one of several colour indices designed
to be most sensitive to dust- and spot-related variability. Nonetheless, a
significant correlation between the variability of two colour indices is found.
This is slightly more consistent with the dust-related variability model than
the cool spot one considered. Based on the theoretically predicted signatures
and the median errors in the colour indices (0.03-0.05 magnitudes), upper
limits are placed on the coverage of possible spots and clouds. Assuming the L
dwarf to be best modelled by a dusty atmosphere at 1900K, coherent clear clouds
are limited to a coverage of 10-15% of the projected surface area and 200K
cooler spots to a 20% coverage. A larger coverage of many small features
varying incoherently cannot be ruled out with this method. A lower effective
temperature restricts coherent clear clouds to be much smaller; a higher
temperature allows both clouds and spots to be larger. These upper limits are
consistent with the two separate variability detections in the I-band reported
by Bailer-Jones & Mundt (2001).

diameter with a young super star cluster (SSC) near the center. The kinematics
of ionized gas is studied through Ha emission with several slit positions.
Position-velocity diagrams show two distinct features with high speed motions.
One is an irregularly shaped region to the east of the SSC, 270 pc in size, in
which most of the Ha emission is blue shifted by 120 km/s, and another is a 350
pc shell centered on the SSC with positive and negative velocity shifts of 60

which is consistent with the photometric age but significantly older than the
kinematic ages of the high speed regions. The energetics of the SSC and its
interaction with the environment are considered. The expansion energies exceed
10^52 ergs, but the power outputs from winds and supernova in the SSC are large
enough to account for this. The intensities of Balmer, [NII], and [SII]

rotation for stars in the mass range between 2 and 60 M$_{\odot}$ for the
metallicity $Z = 10^{-5}$. Star models with initial masses superior or equal to
9 M$_\odot$ were computed up to the end of the carbon--burning phase. Star
models with masses between 2 and 7 M$_\odot$ were evolved beyond the end of the
He--burning phase through a few thermal pulses during the AGB phase. Compared
to models at $Z=0.02$, the low $Z$ models show faster rotating cores and
stronger internal $\Omega$--gradients, which favour an important mixing of the
chemical elements. In very low $Z$ models, primary nitrogen is produced during
the He--burning phase by rotational diffusion of $^{12}$C into the H--burning
shell. The intermediate mass stars of very low $Z$ are the main producers of
primary $^{14}$N, but massive stars also contribute to this production; no
significant primary nitrogen is made in models at metallicity $Z$=0.004 or
above. We calculate the chemical yields in He, C, N, O and heavy elements and
discuss the chemical evolution of the CNO elements at very low Z. Remarkably,
the C/O vs O/H diagram is mainly sensitive to the interval of stellar masses,
while the N/O vs O/H diagram is mainly sensitive to the average rotation of the
stars contributing to the element synthesis. The presently available
observations in these diagrams seem to favour contributions either from stars
down to about 2 M$_{\odot}$ with normal rotation velocities or from stars above
8 M$_{\odot}$ but with very fast rotation.

collective X-ray luminosity of HMXBs can be used to measure the star formation
rate (SFR) of a galaxy. We show that, within the accuracy of the presently
available data, a linear relation between HMXB number and the star formation
rate exists. The relation between SFR and collective luminosity of HMXBs is
non-linear in the low SFR regime, $L_X\propto \SFR^{\approx 1.7}$, and becomes
linear only for sufficiently high star formation rate, when the total number of
HMXB sources becomes sufficiently large. Such behaviour is caused by the fact,
that we measure collective luminosity of a population of the discrete sources.
Although more subtle SFR dependent effects are likely to exist, the data are
broadly consistent with the existence of a universal luminosity function of
HMXBs which can be roughly described as a power law with a differential slope
of $\sim 1.6$, a cutoff at $L_X \sim few \times 10^{40}$ erg/sec and a
normalisation proportional to the star formation rate.
  We apply our results to (spatially unresolved) starburst galaxies observed by
CHANDRA at redshifts up to $z\sim 1$ in the Hubble Deep Field North and show
that the calibration of the collective luminosity of HMXBs as a SFR indicator
based on the local sample agrees well with the SFR estimates obtained for these
distant galaxies with conventional methods.

customers by selecting a subset of items from a universal set based on user
preferences. While research in recommender systems grew out of information
retrieval and filtering, the topic has steadily advanced into a legitimate and
challenging research area of its own. Recommender systems have traditionally
been studied from a content-based filtering vs. collaborative design
perspective. Recommendations, however, are not delivered within a vacuum, but
rather cast within an informal community of users and social context.
Therefore, ultimately all recommender systems make connections among people and
thus should be surveyed from such a perspective. This viewpoint is
under-emphasized in the recommender systems literature. We therefore take a
connection-oriented viewpoint toward recommender systems research. We posit
that recommendation has an inherently social element and is ultimately intended
to connect people either directly as a result of explicit user modeling or
indirectly through the discovery of relationships implicit in extant data.
Thus, recommender systems are characterized by how they model users to bring
people together: explicitly or implicitly. Finally, user modeling and the
connection-centric viewpoint raise broadening and social issues--such as
evaluation, targeting, and privacy and trust--which we also briefly address.

($\xl > 0.2$) in $e^+p$ collisions has been studied with the ZEUS detector at

deep inelastic scattering. The neutron-tagged cross section, $e p\to e' X n$,
is measured relative to the inclusive cross section, $e p\to e' X$, thereby
reducing the systematic uncertainties. For $\xl >$ 0.3, the rate of neutrons in
photoproduction is about half of that measured in hadroproduction, which
constitutes a clear breaking of factorisation. There is about a 20% rise in the
neutron rate between photoproduction and deep inelastic scattering, which may
be attributed to absorptive rescattering in the $\gamma p$ system. For $0.64 <
\xl < 0.82$, the rate of neutrons is almost independent of the Bjorken scaling
variable $x$ and $Q^2$. However, at lower and higher $\xl$ values, there is a
clear but weak dependence on these variables, thus demonstrating the breaking
of limiting fragmentation. The neutron-tagged structure function,
${{F}^{\rm\tiny LN(3)}_2}(x,Q^2,\xl)$, rises at low values of $x$ in a way
similar to that of the inclusive \ff of the proton. The total $\gamma \pi$
cross section and the structure function of the pion, $F^{\pi}_2(x_\pi,Q^2)$
where $x_\pi = x/(1-\xl)$, have been determined using a one-pion-exchange

of a quadrupole to a nearby beam position monitor is determined by finding a
beam position in the quadrupole at which the closed orbit does not change when
the quadrupole field is varied. The final focus magnets of the interaction
regions (IR) of circular colliders often have some specialized properties that
make it difficult to perform conventional beam based alignment procedures. At
the HERA interaction points, for example, these properties are: (a) The
quadrupoles are quite strong and long. Therefore a thin lens approximation is
quite imprecise. (b) The effects of angular magnet offsets become significant.
(c) The possibilities to steer the beam are limited as long as the alignment is
not within specifications. (d) The beam orbit has design offsets and design
angles with respect to the axis of the low-beta quadrupoles. (e) Often
quadrupoles do not have a beam position monitor in their vicinity. Here we
present a beam based alignment procedure that determines the relative offset of
the closed orbit from a quadrupole center without requiring large orbit changes
or monitors next to the quadrupole. Taking into account the alignment angle
allows us to reduce the sensitivity to optical errors by one to two orders of
magnitude. We also show how the BBA measurements of all IR quadrupoles can be
used to determine the global position of the magnets. The sensitivity to errors
of this method is evaluated and its applicability to HERA is shown.

of an unbroken gauged $U(1)_X$ symmetry whose gauge boson gets a Stuckelberg

axion-like couplings to $F_{QCD}\wedge F_{QCD}$ so that the theta parameter may
be gauged away by a $U(1)_X$ gauge transformation. This system leads to mixed
gauge anomalies and we argue that they are cancelled by the addition of an
appropriate Wess-Zumino term, so that no SM fermions need to be charged under
$U(1)_X$. We discuss scenarios in which the above set of fields and couplings
appear. The mechanism is quite generic, but a natural possibility is that the
the $U(1)_X$ symmetry arises from bulk gauge bosons in theories with extra
dimensions or string models. We show that in certain D-brane Type-II string
models (with antisymmetric tensor field strength fluxes) higher dimensional
Chern-Simons couplings give rise to the required D=4 Wess-Zumino terms upon
compactification. In one of the possible string realizations of the mechanism
the $U(1)_X$ gauge boson comes from the Kaluza-Klein reduction of the
eleven-dimensional metric in M-theory.

r=R-L of the support of the one-dimensional ISE. More generally the
distribution of distances to a random vertex in a random quadrangulation is
described in its scaled limit by the random measure ISE shifted to set the
minimum of its support in zero.
  The first combinatorial ingredient is an encoding of quadrangulations by
trees embedded in the positive half-line, reminiscent of Cori and Vauquelin's
well labelled trees. The second step relates these trees to embedded (discrete)
trees in the sense of Aldous, via the conjugation of tree principle, an
analogue for trees of Vervaat's construction of the Brownian excursion from the
bridge.
  From probability theory, we need a new result of independent interest: the
weak convergence of the encoding of a random embedded plane tree by two contour
walks to the Brownian snake description of ISE.
  Our results suggest the existence of a Continuum Random Map describing in
term of ISE the scaled limit of the dynamical triangulations considered in
two-dimensional pure quantum gravity.

Fragment-implantation events have been correlated with radioactive decay events

(1.06+/-0.04)MeV with a half-life of T1/2 = (4.7+3.4-1.4)ms. None of the events
in this peak is in coincidence with beta particles which were searched for in a

daughter decays of the two-proton daughter Cr43 can be observed after Fe45
implantation. The decay energy for Fe45 agrees nicely with several theoretical
predictions for two-proton emission. Barrier-penetration calculations slightly
favour a di-proton emission picture over an emission of two individual protons

along a quantum spin chain (1-D antiferromagnet) having a singlet ground state
with a finite spin gap to the lowest excited state caused by some quantum
effect. Irradiation of a microwave tuned to the spin gap energy excites a
packet of triplet magnons at a specific part of the chain where control and
target qubits are involved. The packet switches on the Suhl-Nakamura
interaction between the qubits, which serves as a controlled NOT gate. The
qubit initialization is achieved by a qubit initializer consisting of
semiconducting sheets attached to the spin chain, where spin polarizations
created by the optical pumping method in the semiconductors are transferred to

frequently modelled ``operationally'' by coupling the system of interest to a
``clock''. According to several of these models the operational approach is
limited at low energies because the perturbation of the clock does not allow to
reproduce accurately the corresponding ideal time quantity, defined for the
system in isolation. We show that, for a time-of-flight measurement model that
can be set to measure dwell or arrival times, these limitations may be overcome
by extending the range of energies where the clock works properly using pulsed
couplings rather than continuous ones.

quantum entanglement. Specifically, we propose that for this comparison it is
fundamental to view topological entanglements such as braids as ""entanglement
operators"" and to associate to them unitary operators that are capable of
creating quantum entanglement.

  Multiuser Detection","presented at IEEE ISIT 2002, 7 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1109/ISIT.2002.1023315",,"quant-ph",,"  Future wired and wireless communication systems will employ pure or combined
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technique, such as in the European 3G
mobile UMTS or Power Line Telecommunication system, but also several 4G
proposal includes e.g. multi carrier (MC) CDMA. Former examinations carried out
the drawbacks of single user detectors (SUD), which are widely employed in
narrowband IS-95 CDMA systems, and forced to develop suitable multiuser
detection schemes to increase the efficiency against interference. However, at
this moment there are only suboptimal solutions available because of the rather
high complexity of optimal detectors. One of the possible receiver technologies
can be the quantum assisted computing devices which allows high level
parallelism in computation. The first commercial devices are estimated for the
next years, which meets the advert of 3G and 4G systems. In this paper we
analyze the error probability and give tight bounds in a static and dynamically
changing environment for a novel quantum computation based Quantum Multiuser
detection (QMUD) algorithm, employing quantum counting algorithm, which
provides optimal solution.

and Toffoli on the basis of a seminal paper of Landauer are extended to
d-valued logics, with a special attention to three-valued logics. Different
approaches to d-valued logics are examined in order to determine some possible
universal sets of logic primitives. In particular, we consider the typical
connectives of Lukasiewicz and Godel logics, as well as Chang's MV-algebras. As
a result, some possible three-valued and d-valued universal gates are described
which realize a functionally complete set of fundamental connectives.
