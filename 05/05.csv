that all three HII regions have core--envelope morphologies. We use the high

temperatures are consistent with an increase in the temperature with
Galacto-centric distance; an effect attributed to a decrease in the heavy

sense, they can be studied by the Boltzmann-Gibbs Statistics if an appropriate
representation of the integrals of motion of the macroscopic description is
chosen. As example of application, it is analyzed the system of classical
identical particles interacting via Newtonian interaction. A renormalization
procedure is used in order to perform a well-defined macroscopic description of
this system in quasi-stationary states, since it can not be in a real
thermodynamic equilibrium. Our analysis showed that the astrophysical systems
exhibit self-similarity under the following thermodynamic limit: $E\to \infty

antiferromagnetism in a strongly correlated electron system. To do this we
construct a Hubbard model on a lattice of self-consistently embedded multi-site
clusters by means of a dynamical mean-field theory in which intra-cluster
dynamics is treated essentially exactly. We show that a class of characteristic
features which have been seen in the excitation spectra of high-$T_{c}$
cuprates (e.g., pseudogap and the spin-flip resonance), as well as their
interplay with the onset of a pairing correlations, can be captured within a
dynamical mean-field theory in which short-wavelength dynamics are rigorously
treated. Thus we infer that the observation of the neutron scattering resonance
in the superconducting state of the cuprate superconductors does not appear to
be directly tied to their quasi-2D character. Although our approach is defined
strictly in terms of fermion degrees of freedom, we show that we can readily
identify the emergence of effective low energy bosonic degrees of freedom in
the presence of a well-defined broken symmetry phase as long as their dynamics
are dominated by short-range, short-wavelength fluctuations. Our results reveal
that the dynamics of staggered spin degrees of freedom builds up coherence and
a resonance-like sharp feature emerges as pairing correlations set in. Under
conditions of superconducting broken symmetry our approach thus extends static
BCS mean field theory to provide an exact treatment of quantum fluctuations of
the BCS order parameter.

10^{11} to 10^{13} GeV, which is compatible with the phenomenology of a

rotational and two translational degrees of freedom. The rotational degree
corresponds to the helicity, and the translational degrees to the gauge degree
of freedom. The question then is whether these two different symmetries can be
united. Another hard-pressing problem is Feynman's parton picture which is
valid only for hadrons moving with speed close to that of light. While the
hadron at rest is believed to be a bound state of quarks, the question arises
whether the parton picture is a Lorentz-boosted bound state of quarks. We study

idea is tested by the two models, the transverse Ising model and the traveling

simple way to introduce quantum fluctuations. The strength of the transverse
field is controlled as a function of time similarly to the temperature in the
conventional method. TSP can be described by the Ising spin, so that we also
apply the same technique to TSP. We directory solve the time-dependent
Schr\""odinger equation for small-size systems and perform the quantum Monte
Carlo simulation for large-size systems. Comparison with the results of the
corresponding classical (thermal) method reveals that the quantum method leads
to the ground state with much larger probability in almost all cases if we use
the same annealing schedule of the control parameters. We also find that the
relaxation time is quite short for quantum systems by numerical simulations. We
