of NGC 3610, a dynamically young elliptical galaxy. These observations
supersede shorter, undithered HST observations where an intermediate-age
population of globular clusters was first discovered. The new observations show
the bimodal color distribution of globular clusters more clearly, with peaks at
(V-I)o = 0.95 and 1.17. The luminosity function (LF) of the blue, metal-poor
population of clusters in NGC 3610 turns over, consistent with a Gaussian
distribution with a peak Mv ~= -7.0, similar to old globular-cluster
populations in ellipticals. The red, metal-rich population of clusters has a LF
that is more extended toward both the bright and faint ends, as expected for a
cluster population of inter-mediate age. It is well fit by a power law with an
exponent of alpha = -1.78 +-0.05, or -1.90+-0.07 when corrected for
observational scatter. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirms the significant
difference between the LFs of the red and blue clusters, with a probability of
less than 0.1% that they come from the same population. A comparison with the
Fall & Zhang cluster disruption models shows marginal agreement with the
observed LF, although there are differences in detail. In particular, there is
no clear evidence of the predicted turnover at the faint end. A by-product of
the analysis is the demonstration that, at any given metallicity, the peak of
the LF should remain nearly constant from 1.5 Gyr to 12 Gyr, since the effect
of the disruption of faint clusters is almost perfectly balanced by the fading
of the clusters. This may help explain the apparent universality of the peak of
the globular cluster luminosity function. (Abridged)

H bands, the galaxy is well resolved into stars. We achieve limiting magnitudes
of F814W ~27 in the WF chips and F110W ~25 in the NIC2. The optical and
near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams confirm a core-halo galaxy morphology:
an inner high surface-brightness young population within ~1.5' (~1 kpc) from
the center of the galaxy, where the stars are concentrated in bright complexes
along a bar-like structure; and a relatively low-surface-brightness, field-star
population extending out to at least 8' (7 kpc). The color-magnitude diagrams
of the core region show evidence of blue and red supergiants, main-sequence
stars, asymptotic giant branch stars and blue loop stars. We identify some
candidate carbon stars from their extreme near-IR color. The field-star
population is dominated by the ""red tangle"", which contains the red giant
branch. We use the I-band luminosity function to determine the distance based
on the tip-of-the-red-giant-branch method: 2.7\pm0.3 Mpc. This is much closer

(dSph) galaxies. It is found that the abundance correlation of barium with iron
in stars belonging to dSph galaxies orbiting the Milky Way, i.e., Draco,
Sextans, and Ursa Minor have a feature similar to the barium-iron correlation
in Galactic metal-poor stars. The common feature of these two correlations can
be realized by our inhomogeneous chemical evolution model based on the
supernova-driven star formation scenario if dSph stars formed from gas with a
velocity dispersion of ~26 km/s. This velocity dispersion together with the
stellar luminosities strongly suggest that dark matter dominated dSph galaxies.
The tidal force of the Milky Way links this velocity dispersion with the
currently observed value <10 km/s by stripping the dark matter in dSph
galaxies. As a result, the total mass of each dSph galaxy is found to have been
originally ~25 times larger than at present. Our inhomogeneous chemical
evolution model succeeds in reproducing the stellar [Fe/H] distribution
function observed in Sextans. In this model, supernovae immediately after the
end of the star formation epoch can expel the remaining gas over the
gravitational potential of the dSph galaxy.

antiferromagnetic fluctuations in $URu_2Si_2$ leads to an almost incompressible
heavy electron fluid, where anisotropically paired quasiparticle states are
energetically favored. In this paper we use these insights to develop a
detailed proposal for the hidden order in $URu_2Si_2$. We show that
incommensurate orbital antiferromagnetism, associated with circulating currents
between the uranium ions, can account for the local fields and entropy loss
observed at the $17 K$ transition; furthermore we make detailed predictions for
neutron scattering measurements.

made to deduce these parameters from experiments on polycrystalline material,

applications, as it is the field which quenches bulk super-conductivity. In
terms of understanding MgB2, it is now clear that the conventional
electron-phonon interaction is strong enough to account for the high transition

fixed point which is spatially separated from the Yukawa brane where two chiral

for the stop sector is arbitrarily large, we find that the stop KK-mode mass
spectrum is completely independent of the Higgs fields. Hence, the Higgs masses
only receive radiative contributions from the top KK-modes. The 1-loop

a negative Higgs squared-mass contribution that triggers electroweak symmetry

dark matter. First, we demonstrate that in order for the density of tachyon
matter to have an acceptable value today, the magnitude of the tachyon
potential energy at the onset of rolling must be finely tuned. For a tachyon
potential $V(T)\sim M_{Pl}^4\exp(-T/\tau)$, the tachyon must start rolling at
$T\simeq 60\tau$ in order for the density of tachyon matter today to satisfy
$\Omega_{T,0}\sim 1$, provided that standard big bang cosmology begins at the
same time as the tachyon begins to roll. In this case, the value of
$\Omega_{T,0}$ is exponentially sensitive to $T/\tau$ at the onset of rolling,
so smaller $T/\tau$ is unacceptable, and larger $T/\tau$ implies a tachyon
density that is too small to have interesting cosmological effects. If instead
the universe undergoes a second inflationary epoch after the tachyon has
already rolled considerably, then the tachyon can begin with $T$ near zero, but
the increase of the scale factor during inflation must still be finely tuned in
order for $\Omega_{T,0} \sim 1$. Second, we show that tachyon matter, unlike
quintessence, can cluster gravitationally on very small scales. If the starting
value of $T/\tau$ is tuned finely enough that $\Omega_{T,0}\sim 1$, then
tachyon matter clusters more or less identically to pressureless dust. Thus, if
the fine-tuning problem can be explained, tachyon matter is a viable candidate
for cosmological dark matter.

instability is driven by localized Fayet-Iliopoulos terms that attract the bulk

framework of a 5 dimensional S^1/Z_2 orbifold and give conditions for the
various possibilities of localization of (chiral) zero modes. This mechanism is
quite relevant for realistic model building, as the standard model contains
U(1) hypercharge with potentially localized FI-terms. The analysis is closely
related to localized anomalies in higher dimensional gauge theories. Five
dimensional gauge invariance of the effective action determines the anomaly
constraints and fixes the normalization of Chern-Simons terms. The localization
of the bulk modes does not effect the anomaly cancellation globally, but the
additional heavy Kaluza-Klein modes of the bulk fields may cancel the
Chern-Simons terms. We discuss also the potential appearance of the parity

culprit for the discrepancy in the values of the compression modulus of
symmetric nuclear matter extracted from the energy of the giant monopole
resonance in 208Pb. ``Best-fit'' relativistic models, with stiffer symmetry
energies than Skyrme interactions, consistently predict higher compression
moduli than nonrelativistic approaches. Relativistic models with compression
moduli in the physically acceptable range of K=200-300 MeV are used to compute
the distribution of isoscalar monopole strength in 208Pb. When the symmetry
energy is artificially softened in one of these models, in an attempt to
simulate the symmetry energy of Skyrme interactions, a lower value for the
compression modulus is indeed obtained. It is concluded that the proposed
measurement of the neutron skin in 208Pb, aimed at constraining the density
dependence of the symmetry energy and recently correlated to the structure of
neutron stars, will also become instrumental in the determination of the

nuclear binding energies and fission barrier heights. Using 2766 binding
energies of nuclei with $Z\geq 8$ and $N\geq 8$ it is shown that the
performance of the new approach is improved by a factor of about 6, compared to
the previously published liquid drop model results, in terms of both the masses
(new r.m.s. deviation $<\delta M> = 0.698$ MeV) and the fission barriers (new
r.m.s. deviation of the fission barriers of isotopes with $Z> 70$ is $<\delta
V_B> = 0.88$ MeV).
  The role of the curvature terms and their effects on the description of the
experimental quantities are discussed in detail; for comparison the parameters
of the more 'traditional' approaches are re-fitted taking into account the
nuclear masses known today and the performances of several variants of the
model are compared. The isospin dependence in the new description of the
barriers is in a good agreement with the extended Thomas-Fermi approach; it
also demonstrates a good qualitative agreement with the fission life-time
systematics tested on the long chain of Fermium isotopes known experimentally.
  The new approach offers also a very high stability in terms of the
extrapolation from the narrower range of nuclides to a more extended one - a
property of particular interest for the contemporary exotic beam projects: the

attempts of circumventing certain assumptions leading to the Bell theorem
(Hess-Philipp, Accardi). If I correctly understand the intentions of these
Authors, the idea is to make use of the following logical loophole inherent in
the proof of the Bell theorem: Probabilities of counterfactual events A and A'
do not have to coincide with actually measured probabilities if measurements of
A and A' disturb each other, or for any other fundamental reason cannot be
performed simulaneously. It is generally believed that in the context of
classical probability theory (i.e. realistic hidden variables) probabilities of
counterfactual events can be identified with those of actually measured events.
In the paper I give an explicit counterexample to this belief. The ""first
variation"" on the Aerts model shows that counterfactual and actual problems
formulated for the same classical system may be unrelated. In the model the
first probability does not violate any classical inequality whereas the second
does. Pecularity of the Bell inequality is that on the basis of an in principle
unobservable probability one derives probabilities of jointly measurable random
variables, the fact additionally obscuring the logical meaning of the
construction. The existence of the loophole does not change the fact that I was
not able to construct a local model violating the inequality with all the other
loopholes eliminated.

theory is obtained via a thermodynamic limit. Unitary representations of the
Poincar\'e group at the level of fields and states are explicitly given.
Non-canonical multi-photon and coherent states are introduced. In the
thermodynamic limit the statistics of photons in a coherent state is
Poissonian. The $S$ matrix of radiation fields produced by a classical current
is given by a non-canonical coherent-state displacement operator, a fact
automatically eliminating the infrared catastrophe. Field operators are shown
to be operators and not operator-valued distributions, and can be multiplied at
the same point in configuration space. An exactly solvable example is used to
compare predictions of the standard theory with those of non-canonical quantum
optics, and explicitly shows the mechanism of automatic ultraviolet
regularization occuring in the non-canonical theory. Similar conclusions are
obtained in perturbation theory, where one finds the standard Feynman diagrams,
but the Feynman rules are modified. A comparison with the Dicke-Hepp-Lieb model
allows to identify the physical structure behind the non-canonical algebra as
corresponding to an ensemble of indefinite-frequency oscillators with constant
