logarithmic slope e ~ 2 of the surface density profile, k ~ R^(1-e), in the
annulus. These 5 systems are very homogeneous, since for fixed H0=100h km/s Mpc
they must have the same surface density, <k>=1.11-1.22 h +/- 0.04, with an
upper bound of 0.07 on any dispersion in <k> beyond those due to the

0.1-0.2 and H0=73+/-8 km/s Mpc. More complicated lenses with multiple
components or strong perturbations from nearby clusters, like RXJ0911+0551 and

among X-ray pulsars due to its ultra-short binary period (P=41.4 min) and
remarkably low mass-function (<1.3e-6 Msun). The far-UV spectrum was exposed
for a total of 32ks and has sufficient signal-to-noise to reveal numerous broad
emission and prominent narrower absorption lines. Most of the absorption lines
are consistent in strength with a purely interstellar origin. However, there is
evidence that both CI and CIV require additional absorbing gas local to the
system. In emission, the usual prominent lines of NV and HeII are absent,
whilst both OIV and OV are relatively strong. We further identify a rarely seen
feature at ~1660A as the OIII] multiplet. Our ultraviolet spectra therefore
provide independent support for the recent suggestion that the mass donor is
the chemically fractionated core of either a C-O-Ne or O-Ne-Mg white dwarf;
this was put forward to explain the results of Chandra high-resolution X-ray
spectroscopy. The velocity profiles of the ultraviolet lines are in all cases
broad and/or flat-topped, or perhaps even double-peaked for the highest

(2001) using Chandra and by Majerowicz et al. (2002) using XMM. The causes of
this discrepancy may be instructive for the Chandra and XMM cluster analyses in
general. The observation used by Schmidt et al. was affected by a mild
background flare that could not be identified by the usual technique. This
flare biased upwards the measured temperatures at large radii. The remaining
discrepancy appears to be due to the XMM PSF scattering that was not taken into
account in the published analyses. While the XMM PSF is narrow, the surface
brightness of a typical cluster also declines very steeply with radius. For the
moderately distant, cooling flow cluster A1835, about 1/3 of the observed XMM
brightness at any radius is due to the PSF scattering from the smaller radii.
As a result, the contamination from the bright cool cluster center biases low
the measured temperatures near the core, and in general, any temperature
gradients are underestimated.

Mira star R Cygni is presented and discussed. The data were collected from the
publicly available databases of the AFOEV, the BAAVSS and the VSOLJ. The full
light curve consists of 26655 individual points obtained between 1901 and 2001.
The light curve and its periodicity were analysed with help of the O-C diagram,
Fourier analysis and time-frequency analysis. The results demonstrate the
limitations of these linear methods. The next step was to investigate the
possible presence of low-dimensional chaos in the light curve. For this, a
smoothed and noise-filtered signal was created from the averaged data and with
help of time delay embedding, we have tried to reconstruct the attractor of the
system. The main result is that R Cygni shows such period-doubling events that
can be interpreted as caused by a repetitive bifurcation of the chaotic
attractor between a period 2T orbit and chaos. The switch between these two
states occurs in a certain compact region of the phase space, where the light
curve is characterized by ~1500-days long transients. The Lyapunov spectrum was
computed for various embedding parameters confirming the chaotic attractor,
although the exponents suffer from quite high uncertainty because of the
applied approximation. Finally, the light curve is compared with a simple one
zone model generated by a third-order differential equation which exhibits
well-expressed period-doubling bifurcation. The strong resemblance is another
argument for chaotic behaviour. Further studies should address the problem of
global flow reconstruction, including the determination of the accurate
Lyapunov exponents and dimension.

1987A) are aspherical. Fifteen years after the supernova explosion, the Hubble
Space Telescope has resolved the rapidly expanding ejecta. The late-time images
and spectroscopy provide a geometrical picture that is consistent with early
observations and suggests a highly structured, axially symmetric geometry. We
present here a new synthesis of the old and new data. We show that the Bochum
event, presumably a clump of $^{56}$Ni, and the late-time image, the locus of
excitation by $^{44}$Ti, are most naturally accounted for by sharing a common
position angle of about 14\degree, the same as the mystery spot and early
speckle data on the ejecta, and that they are both oriented along the axis of
the inner circumstellar ring at 45\degree to the plane of the sky. We also
demonstrate that the polarization represents a prolate geometry with the same
position angle and axis as the early speckle data and the late-time image and
hence that the geometry has been fixed in time and throughout the ejecta. The
Bochum event and the Doppler kinematics of the [Ca II]/[O II] emission in
spatially resolved HST spectra of the ejecta can be consistently integrated
into this geometry. The radioactive clump is deduced to fall approximately
along the axis of the inner circumstellar ring and therefore to be redshifted
in the North whereas the [Ca II]/[O II] 7300 \AA emission is redshifted in the
South. We present a jet-induced model for the explosion and argue that such a
model can account for many of the observed asymmetries. In the jet models, the
oxygen and calcium are not expected to be distributed along the jet, but
primarily in an expanding torus that shares the plane and northern blue shift
of the inner circumstellar ring.

EUVE, our higher signal-to-noise observations present new results and challenge
the current IP models. Previously unseen dips in the light curve are
reminiscent of the stream dips seen in polar light curves. Also of interest is
the temporal extent of the bulge dip; approximately 0.5 in phase, implying that
the bulge extends over half of the accretion disk. We propose that the magnetic
field in EX Hydrae is strong enough (a few MG) to begin pulling material
directly from the outer edge of the disk, thereby forming a large accretion
curtain which would produce a very broad bulge dip. This would also result in
magnetically controlled accretion streams originating from the outer edge of
the disk. We also present a period analysis of the photometric data which shows
numerous beat frequencies with strong power and also intermittent and wandering
frequencies, an indication that physical conditions within EX Hya changed over

cameras sharing a common field of view (~1/6th of the sky) with the coded-mask
imaging telescopes providing the triggers and the coarse localizations of the
bursts. Given the delays to start ground-based observations in response to a
GRB trigger, ECLAIRs is unique in its ability to observe the early phases (the
first ~20 sec) of all GRBs at optical wavelengths. Furthermore, with its mode
of operation, ECLAIRs will enable to search for optical and X-ray precursors
expected from theoretical grounds. Finally ECLAIRs is proposed to operate
simultaneously with GLAST on a synchronous orbit. This combination will ensure
broad band spectral coverage from eV to GeV energies for the GRBs detected by
the two satellites, ECLAIRs further providing their accurate localization to

applied force is investigated in the low-temperature limit where quantum
fluctuations dominate. The motion proceeds via tunneling of segments of the
manifold through barriers whose size grows with decreasing driving force $f$.
In the limit of small drive, at zero-temperature the average velocity has the
form $v\propto\exp[-{\rm const.}/\hbar^{\alpha} f^{\mu}]$. For strongly
dissipative dynamics, there is a wide range of forces where the dissipation
dominates and the velocity--force characteristics takes the form
$v\propto\exp[-S(f)/\hbar]$, with $S(f)\propto 1/ f^{(d+2\zeta)/(2-\zeta)}$ the
action for a typical tunneling event, the force dependence being determined by
the roughness exponent $\zeta$ of the $d$-dimensional manifold. This result
agrees with the one obtained via simple scaling considerations. Surprisingly,
for asymptotically low forces or for the case when the massive dynamics is
dominant, the resulting quantum creep law is {\it not} of the usual form with a
rate proportional to $\exp[-S(f)/\hbar]$; rather we find $v\propto
\exp\{-[S(f)/\hbar]^2\}$ corresponding to $\alpha=2$ and $\mu=
2(d+2\zeta-1)/(2-\zeta)$, with $\mu/2$ the naive scaling exponent for massive
dynamics. Our analysis is based on the quasi-classical Langevin approximation
with a noise obeying the quantum fluctuation--dissipation theorem. The many
space and time scales involved in the dynamics are treated via a functional
renormalization group analysis related to that used previously to treat the
classical dynamics of such systems. Various potential difficulties with these
approaches to the multi-scale dynamics -- both classical and quantum -- are
raised and questions about the validity of the results are discussed.

state fluctuators is developed. There exist two mechanisms of dephasing. First,
dephasing occurs due to direct transitions between the defect levels caused by
inelastic electron-defect scattering. The second mechanism is due to violation
of the time reversal symmetry caused by time-dependent fluctuations of the
scattering potential. These fluctuations originate from an interaction between
the dynamic defects and conduction electrons forming a thermal bath. The first
contribution to the dephasing rate saturates as temperature decreases. The
second contribution does not saturate, although its temperature dependence is
rather weak, $\propto T^{1/3}$. The quantitative estimates based on the
experimental data show that these mechanisms considered can explain the weak
temperature dependence of the dephasing rate in some temperature interval.
However, below some temperature dependent on the model of dynamic defects the
dephasing rate tends rapidly to zero. The relation to earlier studies of the
dephasing caused by the dynamical defects is discussed.

This particle deviates from a geodesic because it interacts with its own
retarded field $\psi^\ret$. A recently introduced Green's function $G^\SS$
precisely determines the singular part, $\psi^\SS$, of the retarded field. This
part exerts no force on the particle. The remainder of the field $\psi^\R =

Schwarzschild geometry, the mode-sum decomposition of the difference between
$\psi^\ret$ and the dominant terms in the expansion of $\psi^\SS$ provide a
mode-sum decomposition of an approximation for $\psi^\R$ from which the
self-force is obtained. When more terms are included in the expansion, the
approximation for $\psi^\R$ is increasingly differentiable, and the mode-sum
for the self-force converges more rapidly.

to the area of {\it any} horizon. This is done by constructing a canonical
ensemble of a subclass of spacetimes with a fixed value for the temperature

For spherically symmetric spacetimes with a horizon at $r=a$, the partition
function has the generic form $Z\propto \exp[S-\beta E]$, where $S= (1/4) 4\pi
a^2$ and $|E|=(a/2)$. Both $S$ and $E$ are determined entirely by the
properties of the metric near the horizon. This analysis reproduces the
conventional result for the black-hole spacetimes and provides a simple and
consistent interpretation of entropy and energy for De Sitter spacetime. For
the Rindler spacetime the entropy per unit transverse area turns out to be
$(1/4)$ while the energy is zero. Further, I show that the relationship between
entropy and area allows one to construct the action for the gravitational field

nature of the observed dark matter in the universe. Various hypothetical

none of these particles have been observed. In this paper I present an
alternative view. The observations indicate the presence of a new force that is
much weaker than gravity on small scales and stronger than gravity on large
scales. This new force is described by a Liouville field that consists of a
scalar field with an exponential potential. The solutions have a Newtonian
behavior on small scales and produce forces that are weak compared to gravity.
On large scales the field has a logarithmic behavior and will therefore produce
flat rotation curves. The Liouville field may therefore be able to account for
the observations that are usually taken to imply the existence of dark matter.

for the starting experiments at HADES we find that the in-medium mass shifts of
the $\rho$ and $\omega$ mesons are governed, within the Borel QCD sum rule
approach, by the density and temperature dependence of the four-quark
condensate. In particular, the variation of the strength of the density
dependence of the four-quark condensate reflects directly the decreasing mass
of the $\rho$ meson and can lead to a change of the sign of the $\omega$ meson
mass shift as a function of the density. In contrast, the in-medium mass of the
$\phi$ meson is directly related to the chiral strange quark condensate which
seems correspondingly accessible.

(EFT) and their application to QCD. For problems with more than one energy
scale, the EFT approach is a useful alternative to more traditional
model-building strategies. The most relevant such problem for this discussion
is that of making contact between QCD and the hadronic phase of matter. As a
simple example, an EFT calculation of the bound states of hydrogen within QED
is sketched. A more significant demonstration of the power of EFTs, the
construction of the chiral Lagrangian and chiral perturbation theory, is also
included. The results provide us with the road map to a complete QCD-based
theory of nuclear matter at nonzero temperatures and densities, a vital
component to a quantitative understanding of the phase transition from hadron
gas to quark-gluon plasma.

$T_d^D$ ('double-tetrahedral') group of symmetry, exact or approximate. The

consequently it can be seen as a geometrical effect that does not depend on a

and a receiver R sharing a classical private key want to exchange a classical
message with the guarantee that the message has not been modified by any third
party with control of the communication line. In this paper we define and
investigate the authentication of messages composed of quantum states. Assuming
S and R have access to an insecure quantum channel and share a private,
classical random key, we provide a non-interactive scheme that enables S both
to encrypt and to authenticate (with unconditional security) an m qubit message
by encoding it into m+s qubits, where the failure probability decreases
exponentially in the security parameter s. The classical private key is 2m+O(s)
bits. To achieve this, we give a highly efficient protocol for testing the
purity of shared EPR pairs. We also show that any scheme to authenticate
quantum messages must also encrypt them. (In contrast, one can authenticate a
classical message while leaving it publicly readable.) This has two important
consequences: On one hand, it allows us to give a lower bound of 2m key bits
for authenticating m qubits, which makes our protocol asymptotically optimal.
On the other hand, we use it to show that digitally signing quantum states is
impossible, even with only computational security.

into account the inefficiency of detectors. In addition we consider the
possibility for pairs of entangled particles to be produced with probability
less than one. We show that when the pair production probability is small, one
must in general use different Bell inequalities than when the pair production
probability is high.

different alternatives of the system. A unified description of both
probabilities and phases comes through a generalisation of the notion of a
density matrix for histories; this object is the decoherence functional of the
consistent histories approach. If we take phases as well as probabilities as
primitive elements of our theory, we abandon Kolmogorov probability and can
describe quantum theory in terms of fundamental commutative observables,
without being obstructed by Bell's and related theorems. Generalising the
theory of stochastic processes, we develop the description of relative phases
and probabilities for paths on the classical phase space. This description
provides a theory of quantum processes. We identify a number of basic
postulates and study its corresponding properties. We strongly emphasise the
notion of conditioning and are able to write ``quantum differential equations''
as analogous to stochastic differential equations. These can be interpreted as
referring to individual systems. We, then, show the sense in which quantum
theory is equivalent to a quantum process on phase space (using coherent
states). Conversely, starting from quantum processes on phase space we recover
standard quantum theory on Hilbert space from the requirement that the process
satisfies (the Markov property together with time reversibility. The
statistical predictions of our theory are identical to the ones of standard
quantum theory, but the ``logic'' of events is Boolean; events are not
represented by projectors any more. We discuss some implication of this fact
for the interpretation of quantum theory, emphasising that it makes plausible
the existence of realist theories for individual quantum systems.
