analysis of the light profiles, we have been able to identify three main
structural components: an unresolved nuclear component, an exponential disk,
and a kiloparsec scale bar.In addition, we also found a ring structure at the
end of the bar that is particularly conspicuous at 12 microns. The Spectral
Energy Distribution (SED) of each morphological component has been modeled as
thermal dust emission at different temperatures. The unresolved nuclear
component is dominated by cold dust emission (T ~ 50 K), whereas the disk
emission is dominated by very cold dust (T ~ 16 K) plus a contribution from
cold dust (T ~ 55 K). The bar emission corresponds mainly to cold dust (T ~ 23
K) plus a warm component (T ~ 148 K). We detect an extension of the disk
emission due to very cold dust, which contributes a large fraction (94%) of the
total dust mass of the galaxy. The estimated total dust mass is 8.2 +/- 10^7
Msun.

An estimate of the amount of dissociated gas can be made using observed Far-UV

stars: ultra-compact objects whose interior consists entirely of deconfined
quark matter. If confirmed, their existence places constraints on the rate of
formation of microscopic black holes in models which invoke a TeV-scale Planck
mass. In such models, black holes can form with ~TeV masses through nuclear
interactions of particles with PeV and greater energies. Once formed, these
black hole states are unstable to Hawking radiation, and rapidly decay.
However, if such a black hole forms in the interior of a strange star, the
density is high enough that the decay may be counterbalanced by accretion, and
the black hole can grow, leading to subsequent catastropic collapse of the
star. A guaranteed source of ultra-high energy particles is provided by the
cosmogenic Greisen neutrinos, as well as by ultra-high energy cosmic rays, and
the implied lifetimes for strange stars are extremely short, contrary to
observations. The observed lifetimes of strange star candidates thus
effectively exclude Planck mass scales of less than ~2 TeV with comparable
black hole masses, for up to 2 extra dimensions. Seeding of strange star
collapse in scenarios with a larger number of extra-dimensions or with higher
mass black holes remains a possibility, and may provide another channel for the
origin of gamma-ray bursts.

OHMs and increases the sample at z>0.1 sevenfold. The Arecibo OH megamaser
survey indicates that the OHM fraction in LIRGs is an increasing function of
the far-IR luminosity (L_{FIR}) and far-IR color, reaching a fraction of
roughly one third in the warmest ULIRGs. Significant relationships between OHMs
and their hosts are few, primarily due to a mismatch in size scales of measured
properties and an intrinsic scatter in OHM properties roughly equal to the span
of the dataset. We investigate relationships between OHMs and their hosts with
a variety of statistical tools including survival analysis, partial correlation
coefficients, and a principal component analysis. There is no apparent OH
megamaser ``fundamental plane.'' We compile data on all previously known OHMs

production in merging systems. The OH-FIR relationship is reexamined using the

related to its morphology. We show this relation in various examples and apply
our results to the distribution of galaxies. If the distribution of galaxies
forms a fractal set, then this property results in a number of scaling laws to
be fulfilled by voids. Consider a fractal set of dimension $D$ and its set of
voids. If voids are ordered according to decreasing sizes (largest void has
rank R=1, second largest R=2 and so on), then a relation between size $\Lambda$
and rank of the form $\Lambda (R) \propto R^{-z}$ must hold, with $z = d/D$,
and where $d$ is the euclidean dimension of the space where the fractal is

apply this microphysical cloud model to a set of synthetic brown dwarf

properties. BL is set by evaluating kinetic and potential energies (T(r) and
W(r)) and calculating R=-2T/W. Then, on BL, R has a minimum which closely
approaches a maximum of w= -dlog W/dlog r. Such $Rw$ ``requirement'' is
consistent with virial equilibrium, but implies further regularities. We test
the presence of a BL around haloes in spatially flat CDM simulations, with or
without cosmological constant. We find that the mass M_c, enclosed within the

which implies the existence of a feature in the primordial power spectrum. This
broken-scale-invariant model predicts a vanishing three-point correlation
function for the CMB temperature anisotropies (or any other odd-numbered-point
correlation function) whilst an intrinsic non-Gaussian signature arises for any
even-numbered-point correlation function. We thus focus on the first
non-vanishing moment, the CMB four-point function at zero lag, namely the
kurtosis, and compute its expected value for different locations of the
primordial feature in the spectrum, as suggested in the literature to conform
to observations of large scale structure. The excess kurtosis is found to be
negative and the signal to noise ratio for the dimensionless excess kurtosis
parameter is equal to $| S/N | \simeq 4 \times 10^{-4}$, almost independently
of the free parameters of the model. This signature turns out to be
undetectable. We conclude that, subject to current tests, Gaussianity is a
generic property of single field inflationary models. The only uncertainty
concerning this prediction is that the effect of back-reaction has not yet been
properly incorporated. The implications for the trans-Planckian problem of

the basis of subsequent theoretical and experimental evidence, and pay
attention in particular to the inhomogeneity of the electron gas. This

claim that strong local-field effects cause a transition to covalent bonds,
which inhibits superconductivity. We consider here strong local-field effects
by making use of the inverse dielectric matrix (in reciprocal space), which we
review in some detail. We distinguish between the electronic and ionic
dielectric matrices, and show that the later can give rise to much stronger
local fields, because of the inherent local nature of the ions (in contrast
with the delocalised nature of the conduction electrons). Moreover, the ionic
dielectric matrix is large only at very low frequencies omega (below the
dispersion frequency of the dielectric constant), therefore the strong
local-field effects do not cause the instability leading to the formation of
covalent bonds. As a result, the maximum Tc can be much higher than the value

organized in superstructures, called metabasins. We show that diffusion can be

dependence resides in the distribution of waiting times. The waiting time
distribution exhibits algebraic decays: $\tau^{-1/2}$ for very short times and
$\tau^{-\alpha}$ for longer times, where $\alpha\approx2$ near $T_c$. We
demonstrate that solely the waiting times in the very stable basins account for
the temperature dependence of the diffusion constant.

lattice, with either geometrical (Tetris model) or dynamical (Kob-Andersen
model) constraints. Idealized compaction without gravity has been implemented
for the Tetris model, and compaction with a preferential direction imposed by
gravity has been studied for both models. In the ideal case of an homogeneous
compaction, the obtained FD ratio is clearly shown to be in agreement with the
prediction of Edwards' measure at various densities. Similar results are
obtained with gravity only when the homogeneity of the bulk is imposed. In this
case the FD ratio obtained dynamically for horizontal displacements and
mobility and from Edwards' measure coincide. Finally, we propose experimental
tests for the validity of the Edwards' construction through the comparison of

the correlation functions of glass-forming systems for states near higher-order
glass-transition singularities is presented. It is shown that the solutions of
the equations of motion can be asymptotically expanded in polynomials of the
logarithm of time t. In leading order, an ln(t)-law is obtained, and the
leading corrections are given by a fourth-order polynomial. The correlators
interpolate between three scenarios. First, there are planes in parameter space
where the dominant corrections to the ln(t)-law vanish, so that the logarithmic
decay governs the structural relaxation process. Second, the dynamics due to
the higher-order singularity can describe the initial and intermediate part of
the alpha-process thereby reducing the range of validity of von Schweidler's
law and leading to strong alpha-relaxation stretching. Third, the ln(t)-law can
replace the critical decay law of the beta-process leading to a particularly
large crossover interval between the end of the transient and the beginning of
the alpha-process. This may lead to susceptibility spectra below the band of
microscopic excitations exhibiting two peaks. Typical results of the theory are
demonstrated for models dealing with one and two correlation functions.

  Algebraic Programming",,,,"cs.PL",,"  A typed model of strategic term rewriting is developed. The key innovation is
that generic traversal is covered. To this end, we define a typed rewriting
calculus S'_{gamma}. The calculus employs a many-sorted type system extended by
designated generic strategy types gamma. We consider two generic strategy
types, namely the types of type-preserving and type-unifying strategies.
S'_{gamma} offers traversal combinators to construct traversals or schemes
thereof from many-sorted and generic strategies. The traversal combinators
model different forms of one-step traversal, that is, they process the
immediate subterms of a given term without anticipating any scheme of recursion
into terms. To inhabit generic types, we need to add a fundamental combinator
to lift a many-sorted strategy $s$ to a generic type gamma. This step is called
strategy extension. The semantics of the corresponding combinator states that s
is only applied if the type of the term at hand fits, otherwise the extended
strategy fails. This approach dictates that the semantics of strategy
application must be type-dependent to a certain extent. Typed strategic term
rewriting with coverage of generic term traversal is a simple but expressive
model of generic programming. It has applications in program transformation and
program analysis.

is a simple, truly meshfree approach for any complicated geometry. More
importantly, the use of nonsingular general solution avoids the controversial

out that if heavy meson chiral perturbation theory (HMChPT) is applied to the

3-body B decays will be too large and especially B^- --> pi^- K^+ K^- greatly
exceeds the current experimental limit. This can be understood as chiral
symmetry has been applied there twice beyond its region of validity. If HMChPT
is applied only to the strong vertex and the weak transition is accounted for
by the form factors, the dominant B^* pole contribution to the tree-dominated
direct three-body B decays will become small and the branching ratio will be of
order 10^{-6}. The decay modes B^- --> (K^- h^+ h^-)_{NR} and bar{B}^0 -->

are thought to prove the existence of a mysterious, instantaneous action
between distant measurements. However, I have shown recently that the EPR
argument is removed, in an interpretation-independent way, by taking into
account the fact that the Standard Model of Particle Physics prevents the
production of entangled states with a definite number of particles. This result
is used here to argue in favor of a statistical interpretation of QFT and to
show that it allows for a full reconciliation with locality and causality.

Bell's theorem does not demonstrate any nonlocality.

repulsive close to the core of the D-brane. Both families preserve the amount
of supersymmetry predicted by the D-brane probe/CFT analysis. All solutions are

crucial to identify the coordinates in which the ansatz looks the simplest. We

exchange of other HS currents. This and other arguments point to the existence
of a consistent truncation to massless HS fields. A survey of massless HS
theories with 32 supersymmetries in D=4,5,7 (where the 7D results are new) is

HS fields in the Type IIB string on AdS_5 x S^5 and M theory on AdS_{4/7} x
S^{7/4}. We discuss breaking of HS symmetries to the symmetries of ordinary
supergravity, and a particularly natural Higgs mechanism in AdS_5 x S^5 and
AdS_4 x S^7 where the HS symmetry is broken by finite g_{YM}. In AdS_5 x S^5 it
is shown that the supermultiplets of the leading Regge trajectory cross over
into the massless HS spectrum. We propose that g_{YM}=0 corresponds to a
critical string tension of order 1/R^2 and a finite string coupling of order
1/N. In AdS_7 x S^4 we give a rotating membrane solution coupling to the

Utilising a 1 kilotonne ultra-pure D2O target, it is the first experiment to
have equal sensitivity to all flavours of active neutrinos. This allows a
solar-model independent test of the neutrino oscillation hypothesis to be made.
Solar neutrinos from the decay of 8B have been detected at SNO by the
charged-current (CC) interaction on the deuteron and by the elastic scattering
(ES) of electrons. While the CC interaction is sensitive exclusively to
electron neutrinos, the ES interaction has a small sensitivity to muon and tau
neutrinos. In this paper, the recent solar neutrino results from the SNO
experiment are presented. The measured ES interaction rate is found to be
consistent with the high precision ES measurement from the Super-Kamiokande
experiment. The electron neutrino flux deduced from the CC interaction rate in
SNO differs from the Super-Kamiokande ES measurement by 3.3 sigma. This is
evidence of an active neutrino component, in addition to electron neutrinos, in
the solar neutrino flux. These results also allow the first experimental
determination of the active 8B neutrino flux from the Sun, and this is found to
be in good agreement with solar model predictions

classical scenario which might serve as a prototype of the dense coding. We
generalize our results also for qudits.

  Mechanics","7 pages, LaTeX",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Discussed in the study are gravitational noise and the nature of entanglement
states. Their role in forming of entangled states. Nonlocal nature of entangled
states can be brought about by Polarization Variables. Polarization Variables
consists of sum a background of random classical gravitational fields and
waves, random electromagnets fields and so on known or unknown, distributed
average isotropically in the space. This background is capable of correlating
phases the oscillations of microobjects. From this follow, that entanglement
polarizations states is the functions of Polarization Variables in Vacuum.

comparative analysis of independence in conventional and frequency probability
theories. Such an analysis is important to demonstrate that Bell's inequality
was obtained by using totally unjustified assumptions (e.g. the
Bell-Clauser-Horne factorability condition). Our frequency analysis also
demonstrated that Gill-Weihs-Zeilinger-Zukowski's arguments based on ""the
experimenter's freedom to choose settings"" to support the standard Bell
approach are neither justified by the structure of the EPR-Bohm experiment.
Finally, our analysis supports the original Einstein's viewpoint that quantum
mechanics is simply not complete.
