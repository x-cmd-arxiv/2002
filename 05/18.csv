periods found for 2MASS 0746+20AB and 2MASS 1300+19 are unique but longer than
those periods likely from rotation velocity measurements and they do not
represent periodic behavior in the light curve that persists through the entire

modulation of a long-lived albedo feature. Instead, rapid evolution of
atmospheric features is likely causing the non-periodic variability. The
remaining variable objects show no prominent features in their light curves,
suggesting even more rapid evolution of atmospheric features. We argue against
the existence of magnetic spots in these atmospheres and favor the idea that
non-uniform condensate coverage is responsible for these variations. The
magnetic Reynolds number in the atmosphere of L dwarfs is too small to support
the formation of magnetic spots. In contrast, silicate and iron clouds are
expected to form in the photospheres of L dwarfs. Inhomogeneities in such cloud
decks and the evolution of the inhomogeneities can plausibly produce the
observed photometric variations.

ultraviolet background capable of photodissociating H2, and it is widely
believed that this background will suppress further star formation in low-mass
systems.
  However, star formation will also produce an extragalactic X-ray background.
This X-ray background, by increasing the fractional ionization of protogalactic
gas, promotes H2 formation and reduces the effectiveness of ultraviolet
feedback.
  In this paper, we examine which of these backgrounds has the dominant effect.
Using a simple model for the growth of the UV and X-ray backgrounds, together
with a detailed one-dimensional model of protogalactic chemical evolution, we
examine the effects of the X-ray backgrounds produced by a number of likely
source models. We show that in several cases, the resulting X-ray background is
strong enough to offset UV photodissociation in large H2-cooled protogalaxies.
On the other hand, small protogalaxies (those with virial temperatures T_vir <
2000K) remain dominated by the UV background in all of the models we examine.
  We also briefly investigate the effects of the X-ray background upon the
thermal and chemical evolution of the diffuse IGM.

detailed treatment of the observational errors and uncertainties in the
evolutionary model. The cumulative redshift distribution of the submillimetre
galaxy population that we present in this paper, based on 50 galaxies found in
wide-area SCUBA surveys, is asymmetric, and broader than those published
elsewhere, with a significant high-z tail for some of the evolutionary models
considered. Approximately 40 to 90 per cent of the sub-mm population is
expected to have redshifts in the interval 2 < z < 4. Whilst this result is
completely consistent with earlier estimates for the sub-mm galaxy population,
we also show that the colours of many (< 50 per cent) individual sub-mm
sources, detected only at 850um with non-detections at other wavelengths, are
consistent with those of starburst galaxies that lie at extreme redshifts, z >
4. Spectroscopic confirmation of the redshifts, through the detection of
rest-frame FIR--mm wavelength molecular transition-lines, will ultimately
calibrate the accuracy of this technique. We use the redshift probability

(100meV). We observe an anomalous frequency dependence of the 208cm^-1
infrared-active phonon mode. This mode demonstrates softening as the
temperature decreases below the 180K metal-to-insulator transition. The same
mode demonstrates strong hysteresis of the frequency and linewidth changes,
similar in its temperature behavior to the hysteresis in the dc-resistivity. We
discuss a possible relation of the observed softening of the mode to the
structural changes associated with the metal-to-insulator transition.

scattering at small x: the total virtual photon-proton cross section depends
upon the two kinematical variables Q^2 and x only via their combination Q^2
R_0^2(x), with R_0^2(x) \propto x^{\lambda}. At sufficiently low Q^2, below the
saturation scale Q_s^2(x) (a few GeV^2), this phenomenon finds a natural
explanation as a property of the Color Glass Condensate, the high-density
matter made of saturated gluons. To explain the experimental observation of
geometric scaling up to much higher values of Q^2, of the order of 100 GeV^2,
we study the solution to the BFKL equation subjected to a saturation boundary
condition at Q^2\sim Q_s^2(x). We find that the scaling extends indeed above
the saturation scale, within a window 1 < \ln(Q^2/Q_s^2) <<

the Fibonacci cube algorithm to be competitive with the product replacement

  The new result leads to an amusing reversal of the state of affairs for

permutation groups was achieved as an application of permutation group
membership algorithms and used deep knowledge about permutation
representations. The new black box random generation algorithm is also valid

data to be processed by a software trigger can be reduced to the <10kHz region
and a neutron, once produced in the detector, can be detected and identified
with an efficiency of >30%.

physics, the dynamics of the vacuum can be expanded in terms with zero or a
finite number of derivatives acting on the fields. Thus vacuum dynamics can
always be absorbed in the (infinite number of) counterterm parameters
necessarily present in the effective lagrangian. These finite parameters, which
at present must be fitted to data, encode the empirical vacuum physics as well
as other short-range dynamics into the effective lagrangian; in practice, only
a small number of parameters must be fitted. The strength of the effective
field theory (EFT) framework is that there is no need to make a concrete
picture of the vacuum dynamics, as one does in a renormalizable hadronic
theory. At the one-loop level, the most convenient renormalization scheme
requires explicit sums over long-range (``valence'') nucleon orbitals only,
thus explaining the so-called ``no-sea approximation'' used in successful
covariant mean-field theory (MFT) calculations of static ground states. When
excited states are studied in the random-phase approximation (RPA), the same
EFT scheme dictates the inclusion of both familiar particle-hole pairs and
contributions that mix valence and negative-energy single-particle Dirac wave
functions. The modern EFT strategy therefore justifies and explains the
omission of some explicit contributions from the negative-energy Dirac sea of
nucleons, as was done to maintain conservation laws in earlier pragmatic
calculations of the nuclear linear response.

of hot hadronic matter by computing mean free paths. Absorption is indeed
negligible for real photons as mean free paths are roughly tenths of
\AAngstr\""oms. However, vector dominance effects, which provide rich structure
in virtual photon mass spectra, introduce nonnegligible reabsorption and
rehadronization resulting in mean free paths of the order of tens of
femtometers. Consequences are illustrated by considering the net dilepton yield
near the rho peak via thermal \pi\pi annihilation from a short-lived hadronic
fireball. Results suggest that disappearance of the rho in heavy-ion collisions
can be due in part to reabsorption/rehadronization rather than solely due to
collective effects.

operate in different phase of matter evolution and different fields of physics.
The attempts to build such wide range theory as a bunch of theories developed
for different fields of physics are not quite successful. The accumulated
knowledge from experiments and observations leads to a conclusion that some of
the adopted postulates in the modern physics are not absolutely fundamental, as
considered so far. A new approach for building of unified model of the Universe
suggests resurrection of the principles of causality and logical understanding
for any kind of physical phenomena. It is successfully applied in a new theory
titled Basic Structures of Matter, which provides fundamentals for a unified
theory about the Universe. The new approach leads to different physical models
for the elementary particles and the atoms and also to a different concept
about the Universe. In the same time the suggested models exhibit the same
interaction energies as obtained by the Quantum mechanics and experiments. The
analysis of the physical phenomena from a new point of view allows deeper
understanding of the relations between the basic physical attributes: mass,
energy, space, time, gravitation and inertia.

trapped cold two-level ion beyond the Lamb-Dicke (LD) limit is proposed. Basing
on the quantum dynamics for the laser-ion interaction described by a
generalized Jaynes-Cummings model, one can introduce two kinds of elementary
quantum operations i.e., the simple rotation on the bare atomic state,
generated by applying a resonant pulse, and the joint operation on the internal
and external degrees of the ion, performed by using an off-resonant pulse.
Several typical quantum gates, including Hadamard gate, controlled-Z and
controlled-NOT gates $etc.$, can thus be implemented exactly by using these
elementary operations. The experimental parameters including the LD parameter
and the durations of the applied laser pulses, for these implementation are
derived analytically and numerically. Neither the LD approximation for the
laser-ion interaction nor the auxiliary atomic level is needed in the present
scheme.
