discussed the most relevant cosmological observations of the last say 10 years
and their implications for our understanding of the Universe. My finding
throughout this meeting has been that it is amazing how our knowledge of
cosmological parameters has improved during the last years. It comes as a
surprise to many, that the simplest inflationary model of adiabatic
perturbations agrees well with present data. But it is frustrating that we have
not made any progress in identifying the dark matter, in contrary, we have
supplemented it by what we call the 'dark energy', a gravitationally and
esthetically repulsive component which is even more mysterious than the dark
matter. We have no understanding about the origin of these two most abundant
energy components of the present Universe.

of astrophysical magnetic fields. The best tested and most robust reconnection
theory is that of Parker and Sweet. According to this theory, the reconnection
rate scales with magnetic diffusivity lambda as lambda^0.5. In the interstellar
medium, the Parker-Sweet reconnection rate is far too slow to be of interest.
Thus, a mechanism for fast reconnection seems to be required. We have studied
the magnetic merging of two oppositely directed flux systems in weakly ionized,
but highly conducting, compressible gas. In such systems, ambipolar diffusion
steepens the magnetic profile, leading to a thin current sheet. If the ion
pressure is small enough, and the recombination of ions is fast enough, the
resulting rate of magnetic merging is fast, and independent of lambda. Slow
recombination or sufficiently large ion pressure leads to slower merging which
scales with lambda as lambda^0.5. We derive a criterion for distinguishing
these two regimes, and discuss applications to the weakly ionized ISM and to
protoplanetary accretion disks.

those in the solar system. Some of these planets have sibling planets, with
comparable masses, orbiting around the same host stars. In these multiple
planetary systems, eccentricity is modulated by the planets' mutual secular
interaction as a consequence of angular momentum exchange between them. For
mature planets, the eigenfrequencies of this modulation are determined by their
mass and semi-major axis ratios. But, prior to the disk depletion, self gravity
of the planets' nascent disks dominates the precession eigenfrequencies. We
examine here the initial evolution of young planets' eccentricity due to the
apsidal libration or circulation induced by both the secular interaction
between them and the self gravity of their nascent disks. We show that as the
latter effect declines adiabatically with disk depletion, the modulation
amplitude of the planets' relative phase of periapse is approximately invariant
despite the time-asymmetrical exchange of angular momentum between planets.
However, as the young planets' orbits pass through a state of secular
resonance, their mean eccentricities undergo systematic quantitative changes.
For applications, we analyze the eccentricity evolution of planets around
Upsilon Andromedae and HD168443 during the epoch of protostellar disk
depletion. We find that the disk depletion can change the planets' eccentricity
ratio. However, the relatively large amplitude of the planets' eccentricity
cannot be excited if all the planets had small initial eccentricities.

means of both a fully relativistic, angle-dependent transfer code and a
semi-analytical, diffusion-approximation method. We find that a power-law
high-energy tail is a ubiquitous feature in converging flows and that the two
approaches produce consistent results at large enough accretion rates, when
photon diffusion holds. Our semi-analytical approach is based on an expansion
in eigenfunctions of the diffusion equation. Contrary to previous
investigations based on the same method we find that, although the power-law
tail at really large energies is always dominated by the flatter spectral mode,
the slope of the hard X-ray portion of the spectrum is dictated by the second
mode and it approaches Gamma=3 at large accretion rate, irrespective of the
model parameters. The photon index in the tail is found to be largely
independent on the spatial distribution of soft seed photons when the accretion
rate is either quite low (< 5 in Eddington units) or sufficiently high (> 10).
On the other hand, the spatial distribution of source photons controls the
photon index at intermediate accretion rates, when Gamma switches from the
first to the second mode. Our analysis confirms that a hard tail with photon
index Gamma <3 is produced by the up-scattering of primary photons onto
infalling electrons if the central object is a black hole.

variations by a factor >25 and 20, respectively. The light curves in the soft
and hard bands are strongly correlated without any significant delay. However,
this correlation is not entirely due to changes in the power-law flux alone but
also due to changes in the soft X-ray hump emission above the power law. The
presence of a soft X-ray hump below 2 keV, previously detected in ROSAT and
ASCA data, is confirmed. Time resolved spectroscopy using daily sampling
reveals changes in the power-law slope, with Gamma in the range 1.74-2.47,
however, day-to-day variations in Gamma are not significant. The Soft hump
emission is found to dominate the observed variability on a timescale of a
week, but on shorter timescales (20000s) the power-law component appears to
dominate the observed variability. Flux resolved spectroscopy reveals that at
high flux levels the power law becomes steeper and the soft hump more
pronounced. The steepening of the photon index with the fluxes in the soft and
hard bands can be understood in the framework of disk/corona models in which
accretion disk is heated by viscous dissipation as well as by reprocessing of
hard X-rays following an X-ray flare resulting from coronal dissipation through

Coulomb interacting particles, forming a linear track and a rotor, and working

the track x, with a prescribed time-dependence of the rotor angle theta,
indicated unidirectional motion of the rotor. Here, for the same system, the
treatment was generalized to nonzero temperatures by including stochastic
forces and treating both x and theta via two coupled Langevin equations.
Numerical results are reported for stochastic homogeneous distributions of
impact events and Gaussian distributions of stochastic forces acting on both
the variables. For specific values of parameters involved, the unidirectional
motion of the rotor along the track is confirmed, but with a mechanism that is
not necessarily the same as that one by Porto. In an additional weak
homogeneous potential field U(x)=const.x acting against the motion, the
unidirectional motion persists. Then the rotor accumulates potential energy at
the cost of thermal stochastic forces from the bath.

developed instrumentation enables both magnetic field (B) sweeps for a fixed

observe series' of resonant absorptions which we attribute to periodic orbit
resonances (POR) - a phenomenon closely related to cyclotron resonance. The
angle dependence of the POR indicate that they are associated with the low
temperature quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) Fermi surface (FS) of the title
compound; indeed, all of the resonance peaks collapse beautifully onto a single
set of f/B versus angle curves, generated using a semiclassical
magneto-transport theory for a single Q1D FS. We show that Q1D POR measurements
provide one of the most direct methods for determining the Fermi velocity,
without any detailed assumptions concerning the bandstructure; our analysis
yields an average value of v_F=6.5x10^4 m/s. Quantitative analysis of the POR
harmonic content indicates that the Q1D FS is strongly corrugated. This is
consistent with the assumption that the low-temperature FS derives from a
reconstruction of the high temperature quasi-two-dimensional FS, caused by the
CDW instability. Detailed analysis of the angle dependence of the POR yields
parameters associated with the CDW superstructure which are consistent with
published results. Finally, we address the issue as to whether or not the
interlayer electrodynamics are coherent in the title compound.

postulated. Geometrically, this phenomenon resides in an exponential-expansion
producing ``conformality constraint'', which replaces Kaluza's ``cylinder

geometrical entities with physical interpretations. Unique to the conformally
constrained geometry is a sectionally isotropic, ultralocally determined
``residual curvature'', useful in construction of an action density for field
equations. A space-time--time geodesic describes a test particle whose rest
mass m and electric charge q evolve according to definite laws. The particls's
motion is governed by four apparent forces: the Einstein gravitational force,
the Lorentz electromagnetic force, a force proportional to the electromagnetic
potential, and a force proportional to a gradient d(ln phi), where the scalar
field phi is essentially the space-time--time residual radius of curvature. The
particle appears suddenly at an event E1 with q = -phi(E1) and vanishes at an
event E2 with q = phi(E2). At E1 and E2 the phi-force infinitely dominates the
others, causing E1 and E2 to tend to occur near where phi has an extreme value;
application to the modeling of orbital transitions of atomic electrons suggests
itself. The equivalence of a test particle's inertial mass and its passive
gravitational mass follows from the gravitational force's proportionality to m.
No connection is apparent between m and active gravitational mass or between q
and active electric charge, nor does the theory seem to require any.

B634 (2002) 370-392","10.1016/S0550-3213(02)00301-2",,"gr-qc",,"  We write down a quantum gravity equation which generalizes the Wheeler-DeWitt
one in view of including a time dependence in the wave functional. The obtained
equation provides a consistent canonical quantization of the 3-geometries
resulting from a ``gauge-fixing'' (3 + 1)-slicing of the space-time.
  Our leading idea relies on a criticism to the possibility that, in a quantum
space-time, the notion of a (3 + 1)-slicing formalism (underlying the
Wheeler-DeWitt approach) has yet a precise physical meaning. As solution to
this problem we propose of adding to the gravity-matter action the so-called
{\em kinematical action} (indeed in its reduced form, as implemented in the
quantum regime), and then we impose the new quantum constraints.
  As consequence of this revised approach, the quantization procedure of the
3-geometries takes place in a fixed reference frame and the wave functional
acquires a time evolution along a one-parameter family of spatial hypersurfaces
filling the space-time. We show how the states of the new quantum dynamics can
be arranged into an Hilbert space, whose associated inner product induces a
conserved probability notion for the 3-geometries.
  Finally, since the constraints we quantize violate the classical symmetries
(i. e. the vanishing nature of the super-Hamiltonian), then a key result is to
find a (non-physical) restriction on the initial wave functional phase,
ensuring that general relativity outcomes when taking the appropriate classical
limit. However we propose a physical interpretation of the kinematical
variables which, based on the analogy with the so-called {\em Gaussian
reference fluid}, makes allowance even for such classical symmetry violation.

hydrodynamic model has led to the conclusion of very rapid thermalization. This
conclusion is based on the intuitive argument that hydrodynamics, which assumes
instantaneous local thermalization, produces the largest possible elliptic flow
values and that the data seem to saturate this limit. We here investigate the
question whether incompletely thermalized viscous systems may actually produce
more elliptic flow than ideal hydrodynamics. Motivated by the extremely fast
primordial longitudinal expansion of the reaction zone, we investigate a toy
model which exhibits thermalization only in the transverse directions but
undergoes collisionless free-streaming expansion in the longitudinal direction.
For collisions at RHIC energies, elliptic flow results from the model are
compared with those from hydrodynamics. With the final particle yield and
$\kt$-distribution fixed, the transversally thermalized model is shown not to
be able to produce the measured amount of elliptic flow. This investigation
provides further support for very rapid local kinetic equilibration at RHIC. It
also yields interesting novel results for the elliptic flow of massless
particles such as direct photons.

degenerate sfermion masses at the same time, in the context of
extra-dimensional models, which can be naturally embedded in a wide class of
string models. The hierarchy of Yukawa couplings and degeneracy of sfermion
masses can be realized thanks to superconformal gauge dynamics. The sfermion
mass degeneracy is guaranteed by taking the superconformal fixed point to be
family independent. In our scenario, the origin of Yukawa hierarchy is
attributed to geometry of compactified dimensions and the consequent volume
dependence of gauge couplings in the superconformal sectors. The difference in
these gauge couplings is dynamically transferred to the hierarchy of the Yukawa
couplings. Thus, our scenario combines a new dynamical approach and the
conventional geometrical approach to the supersymmetric flavor problem.

allows for CP to be broken by both the Higgs VEVs and the Yukawa couplings.
Despite this generality, CP violation may be parameterized in terms of two
basic phases. A very interesting feature of the model is that the mixing angles
in the right-handed sector are found to be equal to their left-handed
counterparts to a very good approximation. Furthermore, the right-handed
analogue of the usual CKM phase delta_L is found to satisfy the relation
delta_R \approx delta_L. The parameter space of the model is explored by using
an adaptive Monte Carlo algorithm and the allowed regions in parameter space
are determined by enforcing experimental constraints from the K and B systems.
This method of solution allows us to evaluate the left- and right-handed CKM
matrices numerically for various combinations of the two fundamental CP-odd
phases in the model. We find that all experimental constraints may be satisfied
with right-handed W and Flavour Changing Neutral Higgs masses as low as about 2

is built out of the lowest lying KK modes of the SYM theory on an $S^3$

amplitudes on this matrix model. For closed strings they arise as in AdS-CFT,
by free SYM diagrams. For open strings, they arise from the diagonalization of
the hamiltonian to first order in perturbation theory. Estimates of the leading

performed in very different regimes. Corrections are organized in powers of

wave corresponds to a certain subsector of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills

particular case of the AdS/CFT correspondence, it is a priori a strong/weak
coupling duality. However, the predictions for the anomalous dimensions which
follow from this particular limit are analytic functions of the 't Hooft
coupling constant $\lambda$ and have a well defined expansion in the weak
coupling regime. This allows one to conjecture that the correspondence between
the strings on the plane wave background and the Yang-Mills theory works at the
level of perturbative expansions.
  In our paper we perform perturbative computations in the Yang-Mills theory
that confirm this conjecture. We calculate the anomalous dimension of the
operator corresponding to the elementary string excitation. We verify at the
two loop level that the anomalous dimension has a finite limit when the R
charge $J\to \infty$ keeping $\lambda/J^2$ finite. We conjecture that this is
true at higher orders of perturbation theory. We show, by summing an infinite
subset of Feynman diagrams, under the above assumption, that the anomalous
dimensions arising from the Yang-Mills perturbation theory are in agreement
with the anomalous dimensions following from the string worldsheet sigma-model.

"hep-th/0205072","Sebastian Silva","Bernard Julia and Sebastian Silva","On covariant phase space methods","34 pages, no figure",,,,"hep-th gr-qc",,"  It is well known that the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formalisms can be
combined and lead to ""covariant symplectic"" methods. For that purpose a
""pre-symplectic form"" has been constructed from the Lagrangian using the
so-called Noether form. However, analogously to the standard Noether currents,
this symplectic form is only determined up to total divergences which are
however essential ingredients in gauge theories.
  We propose a new definition of the symplectic form which is covariant and
free of ambiguities in a general first order formulation. Indeed, our
construction depends on the equations of motion but not on the Lagrangian. We
then define a generalized Hamiltonian which generates the equations of motions
in a covariant way. Applications to Yang-Mills, general relativity,
Chern-Simons and supergravity theories are given. We also consider nice sets of
possible boundary conditions that imply the closure and conservation of the
total symplectic form.
  We finally revisit the construction of conserved charges associated with
gauge symmetries, from both the ""covariant symplectic"" and the ""covariantized
Regge-Teitelboim"" points of view. We find that both constructions coincide when
the ambiguity in the Noetherian pre-symplectic form is fixed using our new
prescription. We also present a condition of integrability of the equations
that lead to these quantities.

We construct explicit models in which the massless fermion spectrum is just the

  One of the motivations for these new constructions is that in this case there
are 2 dimensions which are transverse to the SM D5-brane configuration. By
making those two dimensions large enough one can have a low string scale M_s of
order 1-10 TeV and still have a large M_{Planck} in agreement with
observations. From this point of view, these are the first explicit D-brane
string constructions where one can achieve having just the fermionic spectrum
and gauge group of the SM embedded in a Low String Scale scenario. The
cancellation of U(1) anomalies turns out to be quite analogous to the toroidal
D6-brane case and the proton is automatically stable due to the gauging of
baryon number. Unlike the D6-brane case, the present class of models has N = 0
SUSY both in the bulk and on the branes and hence the spectrum is simpler.

up to four arcs and explain why all other diagrams are expected to give
higher-order corrections only.
  For a large family of graphs with ergodic classical dynamics the diagrams
that exist in the absence of time-reversal symmetry sum to zero. The mechanism
for this cancellation is rather general which suggests that it may also apply
at higher-orders in the expansion. This expectation is in full agreement with
the fact that in this case the linear-$\tau$ contribution, the diagonal
approximation, already reproduces the random-matrix form factor for $\tau<1$.
For systems with time-reversal symmetry there are more diagrams which
contribute at third order. We sum these contributions for quantum graphs with
uniformly hyperbolic dynamics, obtaining $+2\tau^{3}$, in agreement with
random-matrix theory. As in the previous calculation of the leading-order
correction to the diagonal approximation we find that the third order
contribution can be attributed to exceptional orbits representing the
intersection of diagram classes.

likelihood that two density matrices describe the same object. Our measure is
motivated by two elementary requirements, which lead to a natural definition.
We list some properties of this measure, and discuss its relation to the
problem of combining two observers' states of knowledge.

  Transform","15 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We give a quantum algorithm for solving a shifted multiplicative character
problem over Z/nZ and finite fields. We show that the algorithm can be
interpreted as a matrix factorization or as solving a deconvolution problem and
give sufficient conditions for a shift problem to be solved efficiently by our
algorithm. We also show that combining the shift problem with the hidden
subgroup problem results in a hidden coset problem. This naturally captures the
redundancy in the shift due to the periodic structure of multiplicative
characters over Z/nZ.

unitary quantum gate and a general quantum operation on a qudit, generalizing
the formula for qubits found by Bowdrey et al [Phys. Lett. A 294, 258 (2002)].
This formula may be useful for experimental determination of average gate
fidelity. We also give a simplified proof of a formula due to Horodecki et al
[Phys. Rev. A 60, 1888 (1999)], connecting average gate fidelity to
entanglement fidelity.

wave-packets in complex microscopic and mesoscopic collisions. This break-down
manifests itself in coherent superpositions of the rotating clockwise and
anticlockwise wave-packets in the regime of strongly overlapping many-body
resonances of the highly-excited intermediate complex. These superpositions
involve $\sim 10^4$ many-body configurations so that their internal interactive
complexity dramatically exceeds all of those previously discussed and
experimentally realized. The interference fringes persist over a time-interval
much longer than the energy relaxation-redistribution time due to the
anomalously slow phase randomization (dephasing). Experimental verification of
the effect is proposed.

quant-ph/0003137 are studied. It is shown that a control over external field
and tunneling would suffice to fulfill all quantum computations without
valuable slowdown in the framework of such model when an interaction of
diagonal type is fixed and permanent. Substantiation is given through a
reduction of some subset of this model to the conventional language of quantum
computing and application of the construction from quant-ph/0202030.

remains, when will we ever stop burdening the taxpayer with conferences devoted
to the quantum foundations? The suspicion is expressed that no end will be in
sight until a means is found to reduce quantum theory to two or three
statements of crisp physical (rather than abstract, axiomatic) significance. In
this regard, no tool appears better calibrated for a direct assault than
quantum information theory. Far from a strained application of the latest fad
to a time-honored problem, this method holds promise precisely because a large
part--but not all--of the structure of quantum theory has always concerned
information. It is just that the physics community needs reminding.
  This paper, though taking quant-ph/0106166 as its core, corrects one mistake
and offers several observations beyond the previous version. In particular, I
identify one element of quantum mechanics that I would not label a subjective
term in the theory--it is the integer parameter D traditionally ascribed to a
quantum system via its Hilbert-space dimension.
