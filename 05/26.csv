ray bursts (GRBs) to probe the physical conditions in the epochs prior to
reionization. The redshift distribution of GRBs is modelled using the
Press-Schechter formalism with an assumption that they follow the cosmic star
formation history. We reproduce the observed star formation rate obtained from
galaxies in the redshift range 0 < z < 5, as well as the redshift distribution
of the GRBs inferred from the luminosity-variability correlation of the burst
light curve. We show that the fraction of GRBs at high redshifts, whose
afterglows cannot be observed in R and I band due to HI Gunn Peterson optical
depth can, at the most, account for one third of the dark GRBs. The observed
redshift distribution of GRBs, with much less scatter than the one available
today, can put stringent constraints on the epoch of reionization and the
nature of gas cooling in the epochs prior to reionization.

targets for widespread multi-wave observations throughout optics, radio,
X-rays, and high-energy gamma-rays. Observations with the EGRET gamma-ray

pulsed high-energy emission up to a few GeV. Presently, at least seven objects
are known as well established high-energy gamma-ray pulsars. A few of those
emit gamma-rays well above 1 GeV. Forthcoming ground-based Cherenkov telescopes
will enable observations of gamma-rays well below 100 GeV, finally reaching the
yet unexplored energy gap at tens of GeV. H.E.S.S. (High Energy Stereoscopic

produces a characteristic inner cusp, of a density profile \rho \prop r^-a with
a -> a_as > 1, as seen in cosmological N-body simulations of hierarchical
clustering scenarios. Dekel, Devor & Hetzroni (2003) argue that a flat core of
a<1 exerts tidal compression which prevents local deposit of satellite
material; the satellite sinks intact into the halo center thus causing a rapid
steepening to a>1. Using merger N-body simulations, we learn that this cusp is
stable under a sequence of mergers, and derive a practical tidal mass-transfer
recipe in regions where the local slope of the halo profile is a>1. According
to this recipe, the ratio of mean densities of halo and initial satellite
within the tidal radius equals a given function psi(a), which is significantly
smaller than unity (compared to being 1 according to crude resonance criteria)
and is a decreasing function of a. This decrease makes the tidal mass transfer
relatively more efficient at larger a, which means steepening when a is small
and flattening when a is large, thus causing converges to a stable solution.
Given this mass-transfer recipe, linear perturbation analysis, supported by toy
simulations, shows that a sequence of cosmological mergers with homologous
satellites slowly leads to a fixed-point cusp with an asymptotic slope a_as>1.
The slope depends only weakly on the fluctuation power spectrum, in agreement
with cosmological simulations. During a long interim period the profile has an
NFW-like shape, with a cusp of 1<a<a_as. Thus, a cusp is enforced if enough
compact satellite remnants make it intact into the inner halo. In order to
maintain a flat core, satellites must be disrupted outside the core, possibly
as a result of a modest puffing up due to baryonic feedback.

which emits 2 neutrinos. If neutrinos are Majorana particles, this process is
equivalent to the free propagation of a neutrino with the insertion of the
black hole. From this fact, we derive the neutrino Majorana mass. The result is
completely consistent with the recently observed evidence of neutrinoless
double beta decay. And the obtained neutrino Majorana mass satisfies the
constraint from the density of the neutrino dark matter, which affects the
cosmic structure formation. Furthermore, we can explain the ultrahigh energy

means that matter effects just modify the coefficients $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$.

form in dx, dt. It is well-known that any quartic form in two variables can be
represented as a sum of three 4th powers of linear forms. The particular case
of two 4th powers is characterized by the vanishing of a catalecticant
determinant, which is a fourth order PDE for the function f. We demonstrate
that this PDE decouples in a direct sum of two Monge-Ampere equations. A higher
order generalization of this decomposition is also proposed.
