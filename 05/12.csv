framework of the local dynamo problem, as well as in the no-z model (which
includes explicitly the radial distribution of the magnetic fields). When
calculating the magnetic helicity balance we take into account the
redistribution of the small-scale and large-scale magnetic fields between the
magnetic helicities, as well as magnetic helicity transport and diffusion due
to small-scale turbulence. We demonstrate that the magnetic helicity flux
through the galactic disc boundaries leads to a steady-state magnetic field
with magnetic energy comparable to the equipartition energy of the turbulent
motions of the interstellar medium. If such flux is ignored, the steady-state
magnetic field is found to be much smaller than the equipartition field. The
total magnetic helicity flux through the boundaries consists of both an
advective flux and a diffusive flux. The exact ratio of these contributions
seems not to be crucial for determining the strength of the steady-state
magnetic field and its structure. However at least some diffusive contribution
is needed to smooth the magnetic helicity profile near to the disc boundaries.
The roles of various transport coefficients for magnetic helicity are
investigated, and the values which lead to magnetic field configurations
comparable with those observed are determined.

specifically, let $X$ denote the space of all admissible configurations of a
mechanical system. A {\it motion planner} is given by a splitting $X\times X =
F_1\cup F_2\cup ... \cup F_k$ (where $F_1, ..., F_k$ are pairwise disjoint
ENRs, see below) and by continuous maps $s_j: F_j \to PX,$ such that $E\circ

sets $F_j$ in any motion planner in $X$. We also introduce a new notion of {\it

classical description, this peculiar diffusion is due to the onset of a weak
chaos in a narrow stochastic layer near the separatrix of the coupling
resonance. We have found that global dependence of the quantum diffusion
coefficient on model parameters mimics, to some extent, the classical data.
However, the quantum diffusion happens to be slower that the classical one.
Another result is the dynamical localization that leads to a saturation of the
diffusion after some characteristic time. We show that this effect has the same
nature as for the studied earlier dynamical localization in the presence of
global chaos. The quantum Arnol'd diffusion represents a new type of quantum
dynamics and can be observed, for example, in 2D semiconductor structures
