selected directions out from the centers of two small High Velocity Clouds
(HVC), W486 and W491. Both HVCs have a small inner region where the neutral
hydrogen column density N_HI decreases slowly and a larger outer region where
N_HI declines more rapidly, smoothly and exponentially from ~ 2 X 10^19 atoms
cm^-2 down to < 10^18 atoms cm^-2. Line widths, and presumably temperature and
turbulence, do not increase in the outermost regions. Therefore pressure
decreases smoothly, making confinement by dark matter gravity more likely than
confinement by external pressure.
  The more extended HVC, W491, has a superimposed small cloud (which we dub a
``mini-HVC''), offset by 66 km s^-1 in velocity along the line of sight with
peak column density about 5 X 10^18 atoms cm^-2. Preliminary data toward future
mapping of two more HVCs reveals two more mini-HVCs of similarly small size and
central column density a bit less than 1 X 10^19 atoms cm^-2. We suggest that
these three mini-HVCs are not physically associated with the HVCs on which they
are superimposed, but are either very small outlyers of the extended Magellanic
Stream HVC complex or more distant and/or smaller isolated CHVCs.
  The value of N_HI at the point where the neutral and ionized column densities
are equal is ~ 2 X 10^19 atoms cm^-2 for the two mapped HVCs. Therefore the
angular scalelength of the total hydrogen is appreciably larger than the
observed HI scalelength. Previous distance estimates, related to absolute size
and mass of the total hydrogen cloud, may have to be scaled down because of the
undetected, more extended ionized hydrogen.

very unusual abundance variations. For metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] < -1,
[alpha/Fe] \approx +0.3 similar to Galactic halo stars, but for more metal-rich
stars the relationship of [alpha/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H] is lower than that
of the Galactic disk by 0.1 dex. The light elements [Al/Fe] and [Na/Fe] are
sub-solar by an even larger amount, 0.4 dex. The pattern of neutron-capture
heavy elements, as indicated by [La/Fe] and [La/Eu], shows an increasing
s-process component with increasing [Fe/H], up to [La/Fe] \sim +0.7 dex for the
most metal-rich Sgr dSph stars. The large [La/Y] ratios show that the s-process
enrichments came from the metal-poor population. We can best understand the
observed abundances with a model in which the Sgr dSph formed stars over a many
Gyr and lost a significant fraction of its gas during its evolution. Low-mass,
metal-poor AGB stars polluted the more metal-rich stars with s-process
elements, and type Ia SNe from low-mass progenitors enriched the ISM with
iron-peak metals. The type II/type Ia SNe ratio was smaller than in the
Galactic disk, presumably due to a slower star formation rate; this resulted in
the observed low [alpha/Fe], [Al/Fe] and [Na/Fe] ratios. The fact that Sgr
stars span such a wide range in metallicity leads us to conclude that their age
spread is even larger than previously inferred. We derive ages using the Padova

functions. The robustness of the weighting scheme was tested using Monte Carlo
simulation. We find the slope of composite LFs become flatter toward redder
color band. Comparing with field LFs of SDSS (Blanton et al. 2001), cluster LFs
have brighter characteristic magnitude and flatter slopes in g, r, i and z
bands. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the cluster LF has
two distinct underlying populations i.e. the bright end of the LF is dominated
by bright early types that follow a gaussian--like luminosity distribution,
while the faint--end of the cluster LF is a steep power--law like function
dominated by star--forming (bluer) galaxies. We also study the composite
luminosity functions for early--type and late--type galaxies using profile
fits, a concentration parameter and u-r color to classify galaxy morphology.
The strong dependence of LF on galaxy morphology is found.The faint end slope
of the LF is always flatter for early--type galaxies than late--type regardless
of passband and methodology. These results are consistent with the hypothesis
that the cluster region are dominated by bright elliptical galaxies.

simultaneously suppressing small scale structures (within galactic halos) even
more efficiently than WDM. The analysis in the paper shows that the new Dip

physics. Where WDM requires the introduction of a new particle species the Dip
model is based on a non-standard inflationary period. If we are looking for an
alternative to the currently challenged standard LCDM structure formation
scenario, neither the LWDM nor the new Dip model can be ruled out based on the
analysis presented in this paper. They both make very similar predictions and
the degeneracy between them can only be broken with observations yet to come.

starburst dominated to 80% AGN dominated. In all cases the starburst dominates
at rest-frame wavelengths >50 microns, with star formation rates >500 solar
masses per year. The trend of increasing AGN fraction with increasing IR
luminosity seen in IRAS galaxies peaks in HLIRGs, and is not higher than the
fraction seen in bright ULIRGs. The AGN and starburst luminosities correlate,
suggesting that a common physical factor, plausibly the dust masses, governs
their luminosities. Our results suggest that the HLIRG population is comprised
both of ULIRG-like galaxy mergers, and of young galaxies going through their
maximal star formation periods whilst harbouring an AGN. The coeval AGN and
starburst activity in our sources implies that starburst and AGN activity, and
the peak starburst and AGN luminosities, can be coeval in active galaxies
generally. When extrapolated to high-z our sources have comparable sub-mm
fluxes to sub-mm survey sources. At least some sub-mm survey sources are
therefore likely to be comprised of similar galaxy populations to those found
in the HLIRG population. It is also plausible from these results that high-z
sub-mm sources harbour heavily obscured AGN. The differences in X-ray and
sub-mm properties between HLIRGs at z~1 and sub-mm sources at z~3 implies
evolution between the two epochs. Either the mean AGN obscuration level is
greater at z~3 than at z~1, or the fraction of IR-luminous sources at z~3 that
contain AGN is smaller than that at z~1.

starbursts and the halo populations of the galaxies. Special attention is paid
to the effects of dust, chemical inhomogeneities and contamination of nebular
emission to the halo light. The optical/near-IR colour index profiles show a
sharp distinction between the starburst and the host. The hosts have luminosity
profiles characteristic of massive ellipticals and remarkably red colours,
typical of a relatively {\it metal-rich} stellar population of {\it old age}.
These properties are in conflict with the relatively low luminosities. The
situation can best be explained if the hosts have an unusually large amount of
dark matter that can hinder the outflow of metals from the system. The
indicated difference in metallicity between the halo and the young starburst
disproves the recurrent burst scenario and supports different origins of the
two populations. We conclude that these BCGs are undergoing mergers between
early type galaxies/thick disks and gas-rich galaxies or intergalactic HI
clouds, in many respects reminiscent of a retarded formation of massive
ellipticals.

distribution at high redshifts. Recent observational evidence suggests that the
threads, or filaments, of the cosmic web most easily are mapped in Ly-alpha
emission. We describe how such a 3D map can be used to constrain the
cosmological parameters in a way which, contrary to most other cosmological
tests, does not require the use of a standard rod or a standard candle. We
perform detailed simulations in order to define the optimal survey parameters
for the definition of an observing programme aimed to address this test, and to
investigate how statistical and observational errors will influence the
results. We conclude that observations should target filaments of comoving size
15-50 Mpc in the redshift range 2-4, and that each filament must be defined by
at least four Ly-alpha emitters. Detection of 20 filaments will be sufficient
to obtain a result, while 50 filaments will make it possible to place
significant new constraints on the values of Omega_m and Omega_Lambda permitted
by the current supernova observations. In a future paper we study how robust

providing a framework to understand the resulting longitude offsets between

offsets due to aberration and the magnetic field line sweepback, we show that
they are always dominated by aberration for all emission altitudes and
inclination angles. This directly allows the conclusion that the core emission
does not necessarily come from the surface. Our results and the observational
trends imply that for a large number of pulsars the emission altitudes of core
and conal components are close when compared to the light cylinder radius but
not necessarily relative to the stellar radius. The core/cone altitude
differences that we find are typically larger than the individual altitudes
ascribed to them so far. Widely different core/cone altitudes for some pulsars
are also supported by data and suggest a novel explanation of the precursors in
the Crab and similar pulsars. We show that the question of emission altitudes
can not be divorced from considerations of the core/cone components' filling
factors of the polar flux tube. We propose an empirical '1/3 rule' to describe

is reexamined, on the basis of a large body of experimental and numerical
evidence on various subcritical (i.e., linearly stable) hydrodynamic flows.
  One of the main points of this paper is that the length scale and velocity
fluctuation amplitude which are characteristic of turbulent transport in these
flows scale like $Re_m^{-1/2}$, where $Re_m$ is the minimal Reynolds number for
the onset of fully developed turbulence. From this scaling, a simple
explanation of the dependence of $Re_m$ with relative gap width in subcritical
Couette-Taylor flows is developed. It is also argued that flows in the shearing
sheet limit should be turbulent, and that the lack of turbulence in all such
simulations performed to date is most likely due to a lack of resolution, as a
consequence of the effect of the Coriolis force on the large scale fluctuations
of turbulent flows.
  These results imply that accretion flows should be turbulent through
hydrodynamic processes. If this is the case, the Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$
parameter is constrained to lie in the range $10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ in accretion
disks, depending on unknown features of the mechanism which sustains
turbulence. Whether the hydrodynamic source of turbulence is more efficient
than the MHD one where present is an open question.

spin-entanglement in form of an effective Heisenberg spin interaction is
induced between electron spins residing on two quantum dots with no direct
coupling between them but each of them being tunnel-coupled to the same
superconductor. We then discuss a nonequilibrium setup where mobile and
nonlocal spin-entanglement can be created by coherent injection of two
electrons in an Andreev tunneling process into two spatially separated quantum
dots and subsequently into two Fermi-liquid leads. The current for injecting
two spin-entangled electrons into different leads shows a resonance whereas
tunneling via the same dot into the same lead is suppressed by the Coulomb
blockade effect of the quantum dots. The Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the
current are shown to contain h/e and h/2e periods. Finally we discuss a
structure consisting of a superconductor weakly coupled to two separate
Luttinger liquid leads. We show that strong correlations again suppress the
coherent subsequent tunneling of two electrons into the same lead, thus
generating again nonlocal spin-entangled electrons.

continuous, non thermodynamic transition that describes a change in the
topology of the system. Our treatment which predicts both the thermodynamic
phase equilibria as well as the spatial correlations in the system allows us to
treat both the phase separation and the percolation threshold within the same
framework. The density-density correlation correlation has a usual
Ornstein-Zernicke form at low monomer densities. At higher densities, a peak
emerges in the structure factor, signifying an onset of medium-range order in
the system. Implications of the results for different physical systems are
discussed.

wide range of stoichiometries, $\delta$, or, hole doping, $x$. The theoretical
challenge raised by these (and previous) data is to understand why the
T-dependence of $\rho_s(T,x)$ is insensitive to the fermionic excitation gap
$\Delta(T,x)$, which opens in the normal state and persists into the
superconducting state, when presumably $\rho_s(T)$ is governed, at least in
part, by fermionic excitations. Indeed, $\rho_s(T,x)$ seems to have a BCS-like
dependence on $T_c(x)$, which, although not unexpected, is not straightforward
to understand in pseudogapped superconductors where $T_c(x)$ and the excitation
gap have little in common. Here, we contrast ""extrinsic"" and ""intrinsic""
theoretical approaches to the pseudogap and argue that the former (for example,
associated with a competing order parameter) exhibits more obvious departures
from BCS-like $T$ dependences in $\rho_s(T)$ than approaches which associate
the pseudogap with the superconductivity itself. Examples of the latter are
Fermi liquid based schemes as well as a pair fluctuation mean field theory.
Thus far, the measured behavior of the superfluid density appears to argue
against an extrinsic interpretation of the pseudogap, and supports instead its
intrinsic origin.

this law results from the direct Omori law for aftershocks describing the power
law decay ~ 1/(t-t_c)^p of seismicity after an earthquake, provided that any
earthquake can trigger its suit of aftershocks. In this picture, the seismic
activity at any time is the sum of the spontaneous tectonic loading and of the
activity triggered by all preceding events weighted by their corresponding
Omori law. The inverse Omori law then emerges as the expected (in a statistical
sense) trajectory of seismicity, conditioned on the fact that it leads to the
burst of seismic activity accompanying the mainshock. The often documented
apparent decrease of the b-value of the GR law at the approach to the main
shock results straightforwardly from the conditioning of the path of seismic
activity culminating at the mainshock. In the space domain, we predict that the
phenomenon of aftershock diffusion must have its mirror process reflected into
an inward migration of foreshocks towards the mainshock. In this model,
foreshock sequences are special aftershock sequences which are modified by the

InGaAs/InAlAs wafer, exhibit reproducible, sample specific, resistance
fluctuations. Focusing on the lowest Landau level we find that, while the
diagonal resistivity displays strong fluctuations, the Hall resistivity is free
of fluctuations and remains quantized at its $\nu=1$ value, $h/e^{2}$. This is
true also in the insulating phase that terminates the quantum Hall series.
These results extend the validity of the semicircle law of conductivity in the
quantum Hall effect to the mesoscopic regime.

  Bodies","27 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.PF",,"  A number of known techniques for improving cache performance in scientific
computations involve the reordering of the iteration space. Some of these
reorderings can be considered coverings of the iteration space with sets having
small surface-to-volume ratios. Use of such sets may reduce the number of cache
misses in computations of local operators having the iteration space as their
domain. First, we derive lower bounds on cache misses that any algorithm must
suffer while computing a local operator on a grid. Then, we explore coverings
of iteration spaces of structured and unstructured discretization grid
operators which allow us to approach these lower bounds. For structured grids
we introduce a covering by successive minima tiles based on the interference
lattice of the grid. We show that the covering has a small surface-to-volume
ratio and present a computer experiment showing actual reduction of the cache
misses achieved by using these tiles. For planar unstructured grids we show
existence of a covering which reduces the number of cache misses to the level
of that of structured grids. Next, we introduce a class of multidimensional
grids, called starry grids in this paper. These grids represent an abstraction
of unstructured grids used in, for example, molecular simulations and the
solution of partial differential equations. We show that starry grids can be
covered by sets having a low surface-to-volume ratio and, hence have the same
cache efficiency as structured grids. Finally, we present a triangulation of a
three-dimensional cube that has the property that any local operator on the
corresponding grid must incur a significantly larger number of cache misses
than a similar operator on a structured grid of the same size.

hadron colliders since some of the branching ratios are small [O(10^{-6})], and
since B_s decays are involved. By comparing the value of alpha extracted from
this method with that obtained in B -> pi pi or B -> rho pi decays, one can
detect the presence of new physics in the b -> d penguin amplitude. The method
does require theoretical input, but model calculations suggest that the
theoretical uncertainty is at most 5%, and might well be even smaller. These
estimates can be tested experimentally. The method is therefore quite clean.

A^c_\mu are fundamental objects of the theory. The traditional gauge field is
similar to the connection coefficient in the Riemannian geometry covariant
derivative, and the field-strength tensor is similar to the curvature tensor.
In contrast, the connection in Riemannian geometry is derived from the metric
or an embedding space. Guided by the physical principal of increasing symmetry
among the four forces, we propose a different construction. Instead of defining
the transformation properties of a fundamental gauge field, we derive the gauge
theory from an embedding of a gauge fiber F=R^n or F=C^n into a trivial,
embedding vector bundle F=R^N or F=C^N where N>n. Our new action is symmetric
between the gauge theory and the Riemannian geometry. By expressing
gauge-covariant fields in terms of the orthonormal gauge basis vectors, we
recover a traditional, SO(n) or U(n) gauge theory. In contrast, the new theory
has all matter fields on a particular fiber couple with the same coupling
constant. Even the matter fields on a C^1 fiber, which have a U(1) symmetry
group, couple with the same charge of +/- q. The physical origin of this unique
coupling constant is a generalization of the general relativity equivalence
principle. Because our action is independent of the choice of basis, its
natural invariance group is GL(n,R) or GL(n,C). Last, the new action also
requires a small correction to the general-relativity action proportional to
the square of the curvature tensor.

Interestingly, even an arbitrarily small electrostatic charge in the bulk can
induce a singularity-free ``bounce'' universe on the brane, whereas a vanishing

itself as the Gribov copies of the covariant Coulomb gauge in the form of the

several systematic errors in the original analysis. The further re-analysis
here reveals that a genuine effect of absolute motion is expected, in what is
essentially a quantum interference experiment, but only if the photons travel
in the interferometer at speeds V< c. This is the case if the interferometer
operates in a dielectric, such as air, as was the case, incidently, of the
Michelson-Morley experiment. The re-analysis here of the Michelson-Morley
experimental data, correcting for the refractive index effect of the air,
reveals an absolute speed of the Earth of v=359+/-54 km/s, which is in
excellent agreement with the speed of v=365+/-18 km/s determined from the
dipole fit, in 1991, to the NASA COBE satellite Cosmic Background Radiation
(CBR) observations. Other experiments where the interferometers operated in air
(Miller 1925,1933) or helium (Illingworth 1927) give similar results when

Chem. Phys",,"10.1063/1.1527922",,"physics.chem-ph nlin.CD",,"  Highly excited vibrational states of an isolated molecule encode the
vibrational energy flow pathways in the molecule. Recent studies have had
spectacular success in understanding the nature of the excited states mainly
due to the extensive studies of the classical phase space structures and their
bifurcations. Such detailed classical-quantum correspondence studies are
presently limited to two or quasi two dimensional systems. One of the main
reasons for such a constraint has to do with the problem of visualization of
relevant objects like surface of sections and Wigner or Husimi distributions
associated with an eigenstate. This neccesiates various alternative techniques
which are more algebraic than geometric in nature. In this work we introduce
one such method based on parametric variation of the eigenvalues of a
Hamiltonian. It is shown that the level velocities are correlated with the
phase space nature of the corresponding eigenstates. A semiclassical expression
for the level velocities of a single resonance Hamiltonian is derived which
provides theoretical support for the correlation. We use the level velocities
to dynamically assign the highly excited states of a model spectroscopic
Hamiltonian in the mixed phase space regime. The effect of bifurcations on the
level velocities is briefly discussed using a recently proposed spectroscopic
Hamiltonian for the HCP molecule.
