Cosmological basics, for which I was aided by excellent text-books, I emphasize
on attempts to determine some of the important cosmological parameters; the
Hubble constant, the curvature and total mass content of the Universe. The
outcome of these very recent studies is that the ""concordance"" model, that fits
the majority of observations, is that with Omega_m+ Omega_Lambda=1,
Omega_Lambda ~ 0.7, Ho ~ 70 km/sec Mpc, Omega_B ~ 0.04 and spectral index of

  paragraph","Astrophys.J. 577 (2002) 22-30","10.1086/342179",,"astro-ph",,"  We explore the possibility of detecting HI 21cm absorption by the neutral
intergalactic medium (IGM) toward very high redshift radio sources. The epoch
considered is between the time when the first ionizing sources form and when
the bulk of the neutral IGM becomes ionized. Due to the extreme Ly-alpha
opacities of the neutral IGM, objects within this 'gray age' can only be
observed at wavelengths longer than about 1micron. We use the latest
simulations of the evolution of the IGM in the context of LambdaCDM structure
formation models constrained by observations of the highest redshift QSOs to
predict the optical depth as a function of frequency of the neutral IGM due to
the HI 21cm line. We then simulate radio spectra assuming observational
parameters for future large area radio telescopes. These spectra show that HI
21cm absorption studies could be a powerful probe of the rich structure of the
neutral IGM prior to the epoch of reionization, including 1% absorption by the
mean neutral IGM, plus deeper, narrow lines (5% and a few km/s). Most of the
variations in transmissivity are due to the mild density inhomogeneities with
typical values of the cosmic overdensity of about 10, precisely the structures
that at later times give rise to the Ly-alpha forest. We also consider
sensitivity limits and the evolution of radio source populations, and conclude
that it is reasonable to hypothesize the existence of an adequate number of
high-z radio sources against which such absorption studies could be performed.

dominance of a non-evolving population. In contrast, at fainter fluxes (< 2

steep super-Euclidean slope down to our flux limit. Strong luminosity and

revealed a systematic variation of the luminosity of blackbody emission from
the neutron star spanning 3 decades in total X-ray luminosity suggesting that
the level of blackbody emission is controlled by the physics of the inner
disk/stellar interface, which we can hope to understand. Two types of
explanation exist: firstly that there is radial flow between the inner disk and
star at all vertical positions above the orbital plane so that the height of
the disk directly determines the area of star emitting. Secondly, the height of
the emitting region on the star is not directly related to the disk properties
but depends on the mass accretion rate as suggested by Inogamov and Sunyaev
(1999) in their theory of accretion flow spreading on the stellar surface. We
find that the survey results for the emitting area agree with this theory at
the lowest luminosities. However, for higher luminosities, the blackbody
emission is stronger than predicted by spreading theory suggesting that the
emitting area is controlled by radial flow between disk and star.

X-ray binary 4U1705-44 observed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. In the
X-ray color-color diagram (CCD), the source, classified as an Atoll, samples
the upper parts of a Z, starting from and returning to the left bottom of the
Z. We follow the path of 4U1705-44 on its CCD, model its broad band X-ray/hard
X-ray spectrum, and compute the Fourier power density spectrum of its X-ray
variability. The spectral transitions of 4U1705-44 are shown to be primarily
associated with changes in the temperature of the Comptonizing electrons. In
the hard state (top branch of the Z), the source evolves from left to right on
the CCD, while its luminosity smoothly increases.
  Our observations can be interpreted in the framework of a model made of a
truncated accretion disk of varying inner radius and an inner flow merging
smoothly with the neutron star boundary layer. The spectral evolution could be
driven by changes in the truncation radius of the disk; e.g. the soft to hard
transition could be caused by the disk moving outwards. If this model is
correct, then our data show that the disk truncation radius is not set by the
instantaneous mass accretion rate, as derived from the source bolometric
luminosity.
  Comparing the power density spectra of 4U1705-44 and Z sources when they
occupy similar branches of the Z, we show that the most significant difference
is on the diagonal branch, on which the power density spectra of 4U1705-44
remain similar to the ones measured on the top branch of the Z (hard state).

quantum spin chain compound: (CH_3)_2 CHNH_3 Cu(Cl_x Br_{1-x})_3. The system
possesses the bond alternation of strong random bonds that take +/- 2J and weak
uniform AF bonds of -J. In the pure concentration limits, the model reduces to
the AF-AF alternation chain at x=0 and to the F-AF alternation chain at x=1.
The nonequilibrium relaxation of large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations
exhibits critical behaviors of the uniform AF order in the intermediate
concentration region, which explains the experimental observation of the
magnetic phase transition. The present results suggest that the uniform AF
order may survive even in the presence of the randomly located ferromagnetic
bonds.

of the helicase leads to a change in the position of the fixed constraint
thereby shifting the domain wall on dsDNA. We associate this off-equilibrium
domain wall motion with the unzipping activity of helicase. We show that this
proposal gives a clear and consistent explanation of the main observed features

oxygen directly below the Rh(111) surface. We show that oxygen incorporation
will only commence after nearly completion of a dense O adlayer (\theta_tot =
1.0 monolayer) with O in the fcc on-surface sites. The experimentally suggested
octahedral sub-surface site occupancy, inducing a site-switch of the on-surface
species from fcc to hcp sites, is indeed found to be a rather low energy
structure. Our results indicate that at even higher coverages oxygen
incorporation is followed by oxygen agglomeration in two-dimensional
sub-surface islands directly below the first metal layer. Inside these islands,
the metastable hcp/octahedral (on-surface/sub-surface) site combination will
undergo a barrierless displacement, introducing a stacking fault of the first
metal layer with respect to the underlying substrate and leading to a stable
fcc/tetrahedral site occupation. We suggest that these elementary steps,
namely, oxygen incorporation, aggregation into sub-surface islands and
destabilization of the metal surface may be more general and precede the
formation of a surface oxide at close-packed late transition metal surfaces.

model for a short-circuited single domain film, that is a perfect insulator. It
is shown that the calculation of the polarization and other properties profiles

expressed as a power series of the average polarization with a renormalized
coefficient which depends on temperature, film thickness, extrapolation
lengths, and a coefficient for the polarization gradient term in the free
energy functional, the depolarization field being also included into the
renormalized coefficient. The function defining the space distribution
properties is calculated as well and its amplitude is shown to coincide with
the average polarization. The detailed calculations of the spontaneous
polarization, dielectric susceptibility and pyrocoefficient is performed. The
divergence of the dielectric susceptibility and pyrocoefficient for critical
parameters of the thickness induced ferroelectric phase transition, namely at
temperature T(cl) and critical length l(c), is shown to exist with and without
the depolarization field contribution, although the values of T(cl) and l(c)
are different in both cases. The detailed analysis of the depolarization field

  at large Bjorken-x","Proc. of the IX International Conference on the Structure of Baryons,
  Jefferson Lab, March 3-8, 2002",,,"preprint RM3-TH/02-9","hep-ph nucl-th",,"  Power corrections to the Q**2 behavior of the Nachtmann moments of the proton
polarized structure function g1p are investigated at large Bjorken-x by
developing a phenomenological fit of both the resonance (including the photon
point) and deep inelastic data up to Q**2 ~ 50 (GeV/c)**2. The leading twist is
treated at NLO in the strong coupling constant and the effects of higher orders
of the perturbative series are estimated using soft-gluon resummation
techniques. In case of the first moment higher-twist effects are found to be
quite small for
  Q**2 > 1 (GeV/c)**2, and the singlet axial charge is determined to be a0[10
(GeV/c)**2] = 0.16 +/- 0.09. In case of higher order moments, which are
sensitive to the large-x region, higher-twist effects are significantly reduced
by the introduction of soft gluon contributions, but they are still relevant at
Q**2 ~ few (GeV/c)**2 at variance with the case of the unpolarized transverse
structure function of the proton. This finding suggests that spin-dependent
correlations among partons may have more impact than spin-independent ones. It
is also shown that the parton-hadron local duality is violated in the region of
polarized electroproduction of the Delta(1232) resonance.

superconformal flatness are proposed. One of them consists in solving the
Maurer-Cartan structure equations and the other is based on embedding the

towards its ``fixed point'' at infinity during a primordial inflationary stage,

are found to be related to the amplitude of the density fluctuations generated

violations of the universality of gravitational acceleration near the $\Delta a

such a runaway dilaton. Under some assumptions about the coupling of the

give a result that says, roughly, that they have as few first syzygies as
possible. In the general case, the Hilbert function of $R/I$ has been
conjectured by Fr\""oberg. In a previous work the authors showed that in many
situations the minimal free resolution of $R/I$ must have redundant terms which
are not forced by Koszul (first or higher) syzygies among the $F_i$ (and hence
could not be predicted from the Hilbert function), but the only examples came
when $r=n+1$. Our second main set of results in this paper show that further
examples can be obtained when $n+1 \leq r \leq 2n-2$. We also show that if
Fr\""oberg's conjecture on the Hilbert function is true then any such redundant
terms in the minimal free resolution must occur in the top two possible degrees
of the free module. Related to the Fr\""oberg conjecture is the notion of Weak
Lefschetz property. We continue the description of the ubiquity of this

desired time evolution of the system. This affords gate operation times of
nearly the same order of magnitude as the inverse coupling constant of the ions
to a common vibrational mode.

Lett. 89, 143602 (2002).","10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.143602",,"quant-ph",,"  When a resonance associated with electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) in an atomic ensemble is modulated by an off-resonant standing light
wave, a band of frequencies can appear for which light propagation is
forbidden. We show that dynamic control of such a bandgap can be used to
coherently convert a propagating light pulse into a stationary excitation with
non-vanishing photonic component. This can be accomplished with high efficiency
and negligble noise even at a level of few-photon quantum fields thereby
facilitating possible applications in quantum nonlinear optics and quantum
information.
