of non-rotating superfluid neutron stars in Newtonian physics. We use a simple
two-fluid model to describe the superfluid neutron star, where one fluid
consists of the superfluid neutrons,while the second fluid contains all the
comoving constituents (protons, electrons). The two fluids are assumed to be
""free"" in the sense of absence of vortex-mediated forces like mutual friction
or pinning, but they can be coupled by the equation of state, in particular by
entrainment.We calculate numerically the eigen-frequencies and -modes of
adiabatic oscillations, neglecting beta-reactions that would lead to
dissipation.We find a doubling of all acoustic-type modes (f-modes, p-modes),
and confirm the absence of g-modes in these superfluid models. We show
analytically and numerically that only in the case of non-stratified background
models (i.e. with no composition gradient) can these doublets of acoustic modes
be separated into two distinct families, which are characterised by either co-
or counter-moving fluids respectively, and which are sometimes referred to as
""ordinary"" and ""superfluid"" modes. In the general, stratified case, however,
this separation is not possible, and these acoustic modes can not be classified
as being either purely ""ordinary"" or ""superfluid"". We show how the properties
of the two-fluid modes change as functions of the coupling by entrainment. We
find avoided mode-crossings for the stratified models, while the crossings are
not avoided in the non-stratified, separable case. The oscillations of
normal-fluid neutron stars are recovered as a special case simply by locking
the two fluids together.In this effective one-fluid case we find the usual
singlet f- and p-modes, and we also find the expected g-modes.

  Light-Curve Anomalies of Gravitational Lenses","19 pages, 9 figures. Submitted to ApJ",,"10.1086/342121",,"astro-ph",,"  Intensive monitoring campaigns have recently attempted to measure the time
delays between multiple images of gravitational lenses. Some of the resulting
light-curves show puzzling low-level, rapid variability which is unique to
individual images, superimposed on top of (and concurrent with) longer
time-scale intrinsic quasar variations which repeat in all images. We
demonstrate that both the amplitude and variability time-scale of the rapid
light-curve anomalies, as well as the correlation observed between intrinsic
and microlensed variability, are naturally explained by stellar microlensing of
a smooth accretion disk which is occulted by optically-thick broad-line clouds.
The rapid time-scale is caused by the high velocities of the clouds (~5x10^3
km/s), and the low amplitude results from the large number of clouds covering
the magnified or demagnified parts of the disk. The observed amplitudes of
variations in specific lenses implies that the number of broad-line clouds that
cover ~10% of the quasar sky is ~10^5 per 4 pi steradian. This is comparable to
the expected number of broad line clouds in models where the clouds originate
from bloated stars.

The distinction between small-scale and mean-field dynamo (MFD) action in

controversial. This is partly due to concerns about its need for helically
forced turbulence, but mainly because simple ""textbook"" treatments are
kinematic and linear. The non-linear backreaction of the growing magnetic field
has been suspected to prematurely quench MFD action. To resolve the
controversy, we must first understand those non-linear MFDs which can be
numerically simulated. Recently, there has been progress on this front. For
simple MFDs in closed systems, dynamical quenching models that incorporate a
transfer of magnetic helicity between small and large scales agree reasonably
well with fully 3-D numerical periodic box simulations. Unresolved issues such
as the quenching of turbulent diffusion and the additional physics needed to
apply these results to real systems are also discussed herein. The following
summarizes conceptual progress in describing mean-field magnetic energy growth
in the simplest MFDs:
  For a closed turbulent flow, the non-linear mean-field dynamo, is first fast
and kinematic, then slow and dynamic, and magnetic helicity transfer makes it
so.

magnetized molecular clouds are envisioned to condense gradually into cores,
driven by ambipolar diffusion. Once the cores become magnetically
supercritical, they collapse to form stars. Most previous studies based on this
scenario are limited to axisymmetric calculations leading to single
supercritical core formation. The assumption of axisymmetry has precluded a
detailed investigation of cloud fragmentation, generally thought to be a
necessary step in the formation of binary and multiple stars. In this
contribution, we describe the non-axisymmetric evolution of initially
magnetically subcritical clouds using a newly-developed MHD code. It is shown
that non-axisymmetric perturbations of modest fractional amplitude ($\sim 5%$)
can grow nonlinearly in such clouds during the supercritical phase of cloud
evolution, leading to the production of either a highly elongated bar or a set
of multiple dense cores.

they correspond to those measured in a large aperture, so aperture photometry
of standard stars can be used to place the measurements on a standard system.
The technique simultaneously removes the effects of a position dependent

force F is studied focussing on the effects of inertia and elastic waves, in
particular {\it stress overshoots} in which motion of one segment of the
manifold causes a temporary stress on its neighboring segments in addition to
the static stress. Such stress overshoots decrease the critical force for
depinning and make the depinning transition hysteretic. We find that the steady
state velocity of the moving phase is nevertheless history independent and the
critical behavior as the force is decreased is in the same universality class
as in the absence of stress overshoots: the dissipative limit which has been
studied analytically. To reach this conclusion, finite-size scaling analyses of
a variety of quantities have been supplemented by heuristic arguments.
  If the force is increased slowly from zero, the spectrum of avalanche sizes
that occurs appears to be quite different from the dissipative limit. After
stopping from the moving phase, the restarting involves both fractal and
bubble-like nucleation. Hysteresis loops can be understood in terms of a
depletion layer caused by the stress overshoots, but surprisingly, in the limit
of very large samples the hysteresis loops vanish. We argue that, although
there can be striking differences over a wide range of length scales, the
universality class governing this pseudohysteresis is again that of the
dissipative limit. Consequences of this picture for the statistics and dynamics
of earthquakes on geological faults are briefly discussed.

solution. We argue that there are only two technically natural low energy
neutrino mass matrix structures consistent with the LMA MSW solution,
corresponding to either a hierarchy or an inverted hierarchy with pseudo-Dirac
neutrinos. We first present a model-independent analysis in which we
diagonalise each of these two mass matrix structures to leading order in
$\theta_{13}$ and extract the neutrino masses, mixing angles and phases. In
this analysis we express the MNS matrix to leading order in the small angle
$\theta_{13}$ including the neutrino {\em and} charged lepton mixing angles and
phases, the latter playing a crucial r\^{o}le for allowing the inverted
hierarchy case to be consistent with the LMA MSW solution. We then consider the
see-saw mechanism with right-handed neutrino dominance and show how the
successful neutrino mass matrix structures may be constructed with no tuning
and with small radiative corrections, leading to a full, partial or inverted
neutrino mass hierarchy. In each case we derive approximate analytic relations
between the input see-saw parameters and the resulting neutrino masses, mixing
angles and phases, which will provide a useful guide for unified model
building. For the hierarchical cases the LMA MSW solution gives a soft lower
bound $|U_{e3}|\simgt 0.1$, just below the current CHOOZ limit. Both
hierarchical and inverted hierarchical cases predict small $\beta \beta_{0\nu}$
with $|m_{ee}|\sim 0.01$ eV within the sensitivity of future proposals such as
GENIUS. Successful leptogenesis is possible if the dominant right-handed
neutrino is the heaviest one, but the leptogenesis phase is unrelated to the

There is significant mixing between the MSSM particles and new standard model

spin response function), one is able to evaluate the event rate for LSP-nucleus
elastic scattering. The thus obtained event rates are, however, very low. So it
is imperative to exploit the two signatures of the reaction, namely the
modulation effect, i.e. the dependence of the event rate on the Earth's motion,
and the directional asymmetry, i.e. the dependence of the rate on the the
relative angle between the direction of the recoiling nucleus and the sun's
velocity. These two signatures are studied in this paper employing various
velocity distributions and a supersymmetric model with universal boundary
conditions at large tan(beta).

directions. First, one may have a physical model which does not admit the usual
Lagrangian representation, as some terms can be discarded for various reasons.
For instance, the second-harmonic-generation (SHG) model considered here, which
includes the Kerr nonlinearity, lacks the usual Lagrangian representation if
one ignores the Kerr nonlinearity of the second harmonic, as compared to that
of the fundamental. However, we show that, with a natural modification, one may
still apply the variational approximation (VA) to those seemingly flawed
systems as efficiently as it applies to their fully Lagrangian counterparts. We
call such models, that do not admit the usual Lagrangian representation,
\textit{semi-Lagrangian} systems. Second, we show that, upon adding an
infinitesimal tail that does not vanish at infinity, to a usual soliton ansatz,
one can obtain an analytical criterion which (within the framework of VA) gives
a condition for finding \textit{embedded solitons}, i.e., isolated truly
localized solutions existing inside the continuous spectrum of the radiation
modes. The criterion takes a form of orthogonality of the radiation mode in the
infinite tail to the soliton core. To test the criterion, we have applied it to
both the semi-Lagrangian truncated version of the SHG model and to the same
model in its full form. In the former case, the criterion (combined with VA for
the soliton proper) yields an \emph{exact} solution for the embedded soliton.
In the latter case, the criterion selects the embedded soliton with a relative
error $\approx 1%$.

dispersion and the Peierls-Nabarro potential, arising from the lattice
discreteness, on the propagating solitary wave like profiles. A perturbative

negative effective mass. The collison dynamics of two colliding solitary wave

using a partial wave analysis, and using the eikonal approximation. Along with
the expected energy dependence of the corrections, there is also a strong
dependence on the valence-to-core mass ratio and on the strength of the
imaginary potential for the core-target interaction, which relates to
absorption of the core in its scattering by the target. The strength and
diffuseness of the core-target potential also determine the size of the
corrections. The first order non-adiabatic corrections were found to be smaller
than qualitative estimates would expect. The large absorption associated with
the core-target interaction in such halo nuclei as Be11 kills off most of the
non-adiabatic corrections. We give an improved estimate for the range of

neglected, which includes the effect of core absorption. Some consideration was
