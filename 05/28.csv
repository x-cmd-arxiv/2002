time-dependent evolution of non-relativistic outflows from the surface of
Keplerian accretion disks, to three dimensions. The accretion disk itself is
taken to provide a set of fixed boundary conditions for the problem. The 3-D
results are consistent with the theory of steady, axisymmetric, centrifugally
driven disk winds up to the Alfv\'en surface of the outflow. Beyond the
Alfv\'en surface however, the jet in 3-D becomes unstable to non-axisymmetric,
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. We show that jets maintain their long-term
stability through a self-limiting process wherein the average Alfv\'enic Mach
number within the jet is maintained to order unity. This is accomplished in at
least two ways. First, poloidal magnetic field is concentrated along the
central axis of the jet forming a ``backbone'' in which the Alfv\'en speed is
sufficiently high to reduce the average jet Alfv\'enic Mach number to unity.
Second, the onset of higher order Kelvin-Helmholtz ``flute'' modes (m \ge 2)
reduce the efficiency with which the jet material is accelerated, and transfer
kinetic energy of the outflow into the stretched, poloidal field lines of the
distorted jet. This too has the effect of increasing the Alfv\'en speed, and
thus reducing the Alfv\'enic Mach number. The jet is able to survive the onset
of the more destructive m=1 mode in this way. Our simulations also show that
jets can acquire corkscrew, or wobbling types of geometries in this relatively
stable end-state, depending on the nature of the perturbations upon them.
Finally, we suggest that jets go into alternating periods of low and high
activity as the disappearance of unstable modes in the sub-Alfv\'enic regime
enables another cycle of acceleration to super-Alfv\'enic speeds.

cosmology. It is easier to detect than individual clusters in the field, is
insensitive to observational selection effects and does not require a
calibration between cluster mass and flux, reducing the systematic errors which
dominate the cluster-counting constraints. It receives a dominant contribution
from cluster region between 20-40% of the virial radius and is thus insensitive
to the poorly known gas physics in the cluster centre, such as cooling or
(pre)heating. In this paper we derive a refined analytic prediction for C_l
using the universal gas-density and temperature profile and the dark-matter
halo mass function. The predicted C_l has no free parameters and fits all of
the published hydrodynamic simulation results to better than a factor of two
around l=3000. We find that C_l scales as (sigma_8)^7 times (Omega_b h)^2 and
is almost independent of all of the other cosmological parameters. This differs
from the local cluster abundance studies, which give a relation between sigma_8
and Omega_m. We also compute the covariance matrix of C_l using the halo model
and find a good agreement relative to the simulations. We estimate how well we
can determine sigma_8 with sampling-variance-limited observations and find that
for a several-square-degree survey with 1-2 arcminute resolution one should be
able to determine sigma_8 to within a few percent, with the remaining
uncertainty dominated by theoretical modelling. If the recent excess of the CMB
power on small scales reported by the CBI experiment is due to the SZ effect,
then we find sigma_8(Omega_b h/0.029)^0.3 = 1.04 +- 0.12 at the 95% confidence

elliptical galaxy NGC 720 to verify the existence of a dark matter (DM) halo
and to measure its ellipticity. The ACIS-S3 image reveals over 60 point
sources. For semi-major axes a<~150"" (18.2h_{70}^{-1} kpc) the ellipticity of
the diffuse emission is ex ~0.15, which is less than the values 0.2-0.3
obtained from ROSAT because the point sources contaminated the ROSAT values.
The Chandra data confirm the ~20 deg position angle (PA) twist discovered by
ROSAT, but the Chandra twist is more gradual also because of the point sources
contaminating the ROSAT values. Overall the ex and PA values for a<~150"" can be
explained by the triaxial model of NGC 720 published by Romanowsky & Kochanek.
Since the optical image displays no substantial isophote twisting, the X-ray PA
twist requires a massive DM halo if the hot gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium.
The mass-follows-light hypothesis is also inconsistent with the Chandra
ellipticities at the 96% (98%) level for oblate (prolate) symmetry. Thus, both
the PA twist and the ellipticities of the Chandra image imply a DM halo
independent of the gas T profile -- evidence that cannot be obviated by
alternative gravity theories such as MOND. The DM density model, rho ~a^{-2},
provides the best fit and gives ellipticities of 0.37 +/- 0.03 (0.36 +/- 0.02)
for oblate (prolate) models. These moderate ellipticities for the DM halo are
inconsistent with both the nearly spherical halos predicted if the DM is
self-interacting and with the highly flattened halos predicted if the DM is
cold molecular gas. These ellipticities may also be too large to be explained
by warm DM, but are consistent with galaxy-sized halos formed in the Lambda-CDM

temperature 0.5<T<8 keV. Non-gravitational heating is implemented in two
different ways: (1) by imposing a minimum entropy floor at a given redshift,
1<z<5; (2) by gradually heating gas, proportionally to the SN rate expected
from semi-analytical modeling of galaxy formation. Our main results are the
following. (a) An extra heating energy of about 1 keV per gas particle is
required to reproduce the observed Lx-T relation, independent of whether it is
provided so as to create an entropy floor of 50-100 keV cm^2, or is modulated
in redshift; our SN feedback recipe provides only 1/3 keV/part. (b) The M-T
relation is almost unaffected by non-gravitational heating and follows the M
T^{3/2} scaling, with a normalization ~40% higher than observed, independent of
the heating scheme. The inclusion of cooling in a run of a small group has the
effects of increasing T_ew by ~30%, possibly reconciling simulated and observed
M-T relations, and of decreasing Lx by ~40%. In spite of the inclusion of SN
feedback energy, almost 40% of the gas becomes cold, in excess of current
observational estimates. (abridged)

to form a sample of 10 DLAs in which the abundances of N and of one of the two

that the (N/O) ratio exhibits a larger range of values than other ratios of
heavy elements in DLAs; however, all 10 DLAs fall in the region of the (N/O)

production. Our results provide empirical evidence in support of the proposal
that intermediate mass stars (with masses less than 7 solar masses) are the
main source of primary nitrogen, so that its release into the ISM lags behind
that of oxygen, which is produced by Type II SNae. A high proportion (40%) of
the DLAs in our sample have apparently not yet attained the full primary level

we are studying preferentially picks out galaxies which have only recently
condensed out of the IGM and begun forming stars. Alternatively, the delay in
the release of N following an episode of star formation may increase with
decreasing metallicity, if stars of progressively lower masses than 4 solar
masses can synthesize N in their hotter interiors.

common occurrence in galaxy clusters. Excess soft X-ray radiation, above the
contribution from the hot intra-cluster medium, is evident in a large fraction
of sources, and is clearly detected with large statistical significance in the
deepest observations. The investigation relies on new, high resolution 21 cm HI
observations. The sample selection also features analysis of infra-red images,
to further ensure reliability of results with respect to the characteristics of
Galactic absorption. The possibility of background or calibration effects as
cause of the excess emission is likewise investigated; a detailed analysis of
the distribution of the excess emission with respect to detector position and
Galactic HI column density shows that the excess emission is a genuine
celestial phenomenon. We find evidence for a preferential distribution of the
soft excess emission at distances larger than ~150-200 kpc from the centers of
clusters; this behavior may be naturally explained in the context of a
non-thermal Inverse-Compton scenario. Alternatively, we propose that the
phenomenon may be caused by thermal emission of very large-scale `warm'

relieves the very demanding requirements of either the traditional

contribution, but they are an intrinsic feature of fast flares. We suggest that
the achromatic mechanism causing the long-term flux base-level modulation can
be envisaged in a variation of the relativistic Doppler beaming factor, and
that this variation is likely due to a change of the viewing angle. Discrete
correlation function (DCF) analysis reveals the existence of a characteristic
time scale of variability of about 7 h in the light curve of the core WEBT
campaign, while no measurable time delay between variations in the B and R
bands is found.

identification almost 4 years after its discovery. This failure is all the more
notable given the availability of supporting multi-frequency data of
unparalleled depth, and sub-arcsec positional accuracy for the sub-mm/mm
source. Consequently, HDF850.1 has become a test case of the possibility that
the most violently star-forming objects in the universe are too red and/or
distant to be seen in the deepest optical images. Here we report the discovery
of the host galaxy of HDF850.1. This object has been revealed by careful
analysis of a new, deep K-prime image of the HDF obtained with the Subaru 8.2-m
telescope. Its reality is confirmed by a similar analysis of the HST NICMOS
F160W image of the same region. This object is extremely faint (K=23.5), clumpy
(on sub-arcsec scales) and very red (I-K > 5.2; H-K = 1.4 +- 0.35). The
likelihood that it is the correct identification is strongly reinforced by a
reanalysis of the combined MERLIN+VLA 1.4-GHz map of the field which yields a
new radio detection of HDF850.1 only 0.1 arcsec from the new near-ir
counterpart, and with sufficient positional accuracy to exclude all previously
considered alternative optical candidates. We have calculated new confidence
limits on the estimated redshift of HDF850.1 and find z = 4.1 +- 0.5. We also
calculate that the flux density of HDF850.1 has been boosted by a factor of ~3
through lensing by the intervening elliptical 3-586.0, consistent with
predictions that a small but significant fraction of blank-field sub-mm sources
are lensed by foreground galaxies. We discuss the wider implications of these
results for the sub-mm population and cosmic star-formation history.

for the source of cosmic rays, at least to energies up to ~10^14 eV, it is only
over the past several years that direct evidence of such energetic particles in
SNRs has been uncovered. X-ray observations of several shell-type SNRs have now
revealed sites dominated by nonthermal emission, indicating an electron
population whose energy extends far beyond the thermal distribution typical of
such SNRs. In other remnants, discrepancies between the shock velocity and the
electron temperature points to a strong cosmic ray component that has
essentially thrived at the expense of the thermal component of the gas.
Modeling of the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission provides strong
constraints on the acceleration mechanism as well as the properties of the
ambient medium in which the mechanism prospers. In the innermost regions of
some SNRs, particle acceleration is taking place over much different scales.
The formation of Crab-like pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) is understood to require
the presence of a termination shock at which the relativistic pulsar wind is
forced to join the slow expansion of the outer nebula. While the acceleration
mechanism is necessarily different, these shocks also act as sites in which
particles are boosted to high energies. In the Crab Nebula, optical wisps mark
the location of this termination shock. Recent X-ray observations have begun to
reveal the termination shock zones in other PWNe, and are now allowing us to
constrain the nature of the pulsar wind as well as the flow conditions in the
outer nebula. Here I present a summary of the properties of shock acceleration
in these two distinct regions of SNRs, and review recent observational results
in which the properties of the shocks are finally being revealed.

The theory is developed in a general three-dimensional form, as well as in a
simpler one-dimensional version. Using the latter, we demonstrate that the
theory predicts the formation of a partial-bilayer smectic-A phase in this

be second order. Since the smectic phase is induced solely by the difference in
the rigidities, the onset of smectic ordering is shown to be an entropic effect

interactions between unlike chain segments. These findings are compared with

trajectory approach to a measurement problem of a two-state quantum system (a
qubit), an electron coherently tunneling between two coupled quantum dots
(CQD's) measured by a low transparency point contact (PC) detector. We show
that the master equation of ``partially'' reduced density matrix can be derived
from the quantum trajectory equation (stochastic master equation) by simply
taking a ``partial'' average over the all possible outcomes of the measurement.
If a full ensemble average is taken, the traditional (unconditional) master
equation of reduced density matrix is then obtained. This unified picture, in
terms of averaging over (tracing out) different amount of detection records
(detector states), for these seemingly different approaches reported in the
literature is particularly easy to understand using our formalism. To further
demonstrate this connection, we analyze an important ensemble quantity for an
initial qubit state readout experiment, $P(N,t)$, the probability distribution
of finding $N$ electrons that have tunneled through the PC barrier in time $t$.
The simulation results of $P(N,t)$ using 10000 quantum trajectories and
corresponding measurement records are, as expected, in very good agreement with
those obtained from the Fourier analysis of the ``partially'' reduced density
matrix. However, the quantum trajectory approach provides more information and
more physical insights into the ensemble and time averaged quantity $P(N,t)$.
Each quantum trajectory resembles a single history of the qubit state in a
single run of the continuous measurement experiment. We finally discuss, in
this approach, the possibility of reading out the state of the qubit system in
a single-shot experiment.

First we investigate a mechanism to generate periodic pulses of coherent matter

height of the energy barrier. We show that is possible to control the periodic
emission of matter waves and the tunneling fraction of the Bose condensate. We
find that the number of emitted particles strongly increases if the period of
oscillation of the height of the energy barrier is in parametric resonance with
the period of oscillation of the center of mass of the condensate inside the
potential well. Then we use NPSE to analyze the periodic tunneling of a
Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential which has an oscillating
energy barrier. We show that the dynamics of the Bose condensate critically
depends on the frequency of the oscillating energy barrier. The macroscopic
quantum self-trapping (MQST) of the condensate can be suppressed under the
condition of parametric resonance between the frequency of the energy barrier
and the frequency of oscillation through the barrier of the very small fraction
of particles which remain untrapped during MQST.

evidences that these domains are not regions with a temperature above Tc, as

here in contrast they appear in a wide temperature range. Under some
conditions, these domains will propagate and destroy the superconductivity

to render absence of singularity a tautology for self-consistency of the

precisely the integers from 1 to lambda_i inclusive, and (2) for all j, the

was originally motivated by Rota's basis conjecture and, if true, yields a new

concentrations of polymers we study the effects of a weakly space-dependent
viscosity on the stability of hydrodynamic flows. In a recent Letter [Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 87}, 174501, (2001)] we exposed the crucial role played by a
localized region where the energy of fluctuations is produced by interactions
with the mean flow (the ""critical layer""). We showed that a layer of weakly
space-dependent viscosity placed near the critical layer can have a very large
stabilizing effect on hydrodynamic fluctuations, retarding significantly the
onset of turbulence. In this paper we extend these observation in two
directions: first we show that the strong stabilization of the primary
instability is also obtained when the viscosity profile is realistic (inferred
from simulations of turbulent flows with a small concentration of polymers).
Second, we analyze the secondary instability (around the time-dependent primary
instability) and find similar strong stabilization. Since the secondary
instability develops around a time-dependent solution and is three-dimensional,
this brings us closer to the turbulent case. We reiterate that the large effect
is {\em not} due to a modified dissipation (as is assumed in some theories of
drag reduction), but due to reduced energy intake from the mean flow to the
fluctuations. We propose that similar physics act in turbulent drag reduction.

type-I spontaneous parametric downconversion in a two-crystal geometry. Photons
are detected in coincidence by single-photon counting modules and show strong
angular and polarization correlations. We observe more than 100 entangled
photon pairs per second. A test of a Bell inequality can be performed in an
afternoon.

environmental decoherence are shown to be incorrect: 1) linear coupling to
harmonic oscillator bath is a universal model of decoherence, 2) chaotic
environments are more efficient decoherers.

Lett. 89, 207902 (2002)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.207902",,"quant-ph",,"  We propose a realization of a scalable, high-performance quantum processor
whose qubits are represented by the ground and subradiant states of effective
dimers formed by pairs of two-level systems coupled by resonant dipole-dipole
interaction. The dimers are implanted in low-temperature solid host material at
controllable nanoscale separations. The two-qubit entanglement either relies on
the coherent excitation exchange between the dimers or is mediated by external
laser fields.

an algorithm for multiobject search with certainty in an unsorted database of
$N$ items. Depending on the number of the objects, the technique of phase
tunning is included in the algorithm. If one single object is to be searched,
this algorithm performs a factor of two improvement over the best algorithm for
a classical sorted database. While if the number of the objects is larger than
one, the algorithm requires slightly less than $\log_{4}N$ queries, but no
classical counterpart exists since the resulting state is a superposition of
the marked states.

on laser manipulation of atomic ensembles and single-photon detection, and well
fits the status of the current experimental technology. In addition, we show
one of the applications of the kind of W class states, teleporting an entangled
state of atomic ensembles with unknown coefficients to more than one distant
parties, either one of which equally likely receives the transmitted state.
