very soft X-ray source RX J1836.2+5925, which has been suspected to be an
isolated neutron star associated with the brightest as-yet unidentified EGRET
source outside the Galactic plane, 3EG J1835+5918. An extended source having a
complex, bipolar shape is found at B ~ 26, and this might be an extended pulsar
nebular whose flux is about 5-6 orders of magnitude lower than gamma-ray flux,
although finding a galaxy of this magnitude by chance in the error circle is of
order unity. We have found two even fainter, possibly point sources at B ~ 28,
although their detections are not firm because of low signal-to-noise. If the
extended object of B ~ 26 is a galaxy and not related to 3EG J1835+5918, a
lower limit on X-ray/optical flux ratio is set as f_X/f_B >~ 2700, giving a
further strong support of the neutron-star identification of 3EG J1835+5918.
Interestingly, if either of the two sources at B ~ 28 is the real counterpart
of RX J1836.2+5925 and thermal emission from the surface of an isolated neutron
star, the temperature and distance to the source become ~ 4 x 10^5K and ~300pc,
respectively, showing a striking similarity of its spectral energy distribution
to the proto-type radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar Geminga. No detection of
nonthermal hard X-ray emission is consistent with the ASCA upper limit, if the
nonthermal flux of 3EG J1835+5918/RX J1836.2+5925 is at a similar level with
that of Gemiga.

radiative manifestation of a $2.6\times 10^6 M_\odot$ supermassive black hole.
At least a portion of its spectrum--notably the mm/sub-mm ``bump''--appears to
be produced within the inner portion ($r< 10 r_S$) of a hot, magnetized
Keplerian flow, whose characteristics are also consistent with the $\sim 10%$
linear polarization detected from this source at mm wavelengths. (The
Schwarzschild radius, $r_S$, for an object of this mass $M$ is $2GM/c^2\approx
7.7\times 10^{11}$ cm, or roughly 1/20 A.U.) The recent detection of a 106-day
cycle in Sgr A*'s radio variability adds significant intrigue to this picture,
since it may signal a precession of the disk induced by the spin $a$ of the
black hole. The dynamical time scale near the marginally stable orbit around an
object with this mass is $\approx 20$ mins. Thus, since the physical conditions
associated with the disk around Sgr A* imply rigid-body rotation, a precession
period of 106 days may be indicative of a small black hole spin if the
circularized flow is confined to a region $\sim 30 r_S$, for which $a\approx
(M/10) (r_o/30 r_S)^{5/2}$. The precession of a larger structure would require
a bigger black hole spin. We note that a small value of $a/M$ ($< 0.1$) would
be favored if the non-thermal ($\sim 1-20$ cm) portion of Sgr A*'s spectrum is
powered with energy extracted via a Blandford-Znajek type of process, for which
the observed luminosity would correspond to an outer disk radius $r_o\sim 30
r_S$. Such a small disk size is also suggested by earlier hydrodynamical
simulations, and is implied by Sgr A*'s spectral and polarimetric
characteristics.

al. (2002) in GRB 011211. We argue that models previously discussed in the
literature require either a very extreme geometry or too much mass in the
line-emitting region. We propose a new model in which gamma-rays and radiation
from the early x-ray afterglow are back-scattered by an electron-positron pair
screen at a distance of about $10^{14}-10^{15}$ cm from the source and
irradiate the expanding outer layers of the supernova ejecta, thereby producing
x-ray lines. The model suffers from fewer problems compared to previous models.
It also has the advantage of requiring only a single explosion to produce both
the GRB and the supernova ejecta, in contrast to most other models for the
lines which require the supernova to go off days or weeks prior to the GRB. The
model, however, has difficulty explaining the $>10^{48}$ ergs of energy emitted
in the x-ray lines, which requires somewhat extreme choices of model
parameters. The difficulties associated with the various models are not
particular to GRB 011211. They are likely to pose a problem for any GRB with
x-ray lines.

collisionless plasma in the presence of a weak magnetic field; we restrict our
analysis to wavelengths much larger than the proton Larmor radius. This is the
kinetic version of the magnetorotational instability explored extensively as
mechanism for magnetic field amplification and angular momentum transport in
accretion disks. The kinetic calculation is appropriate for hot accretion flows
onto compact objects and for the growth of very weak magnetic fields, where the
collisional mean free path is larger than the wavelength of the unstable modes.
We show that the kinetic instability criterion is the same as in MHD, namely
that the angular velocity decrease outwards. However, nearly every mode has a
linear kinetic growth rate that differs from its MHD counterpart. The kinetic
growth rates also depend explicitly on beta, i.e., on the ratio of the gas
pressure to the pressure of the seed magnetic field. For beta ~ 1 the kinetic
growth rates are similar to the MHD growth rates while for beta >> 1 they
differ significantly. For beta >> 1, the fastest growing mode has a growth rate
of sqrt{3} Omega for a Keplerian disk, larger than its MHD counterpart; there
are also many modes whose growth rates are negligible, < beta^{-1/2} Omega <<
Omega. We provide a detailed physical interpretation of these results and show
that gas pressure forces, rather than just magnetic forces, are central to the
behavior of the magnetorotational instability in a collisionless plasma. We

be causally associated with the current burst of star formation. A relatively

associated with the current starburst. We estimate a star formation efficiency

interpretation relies on a model of the chemical and thermal balance in
photon-illuminated gas. The data constrain well the nR product between gas
density and H2 formation rate on dust grains: nR = 1 to 2.2 e-15 s-1. For each
line of sight the mean effective H2 density n, assumed uniform, is obtained by
the best fit of the model to the observed N(J=1)/N(J=0) ratio, since the
radiation field is known. Combining n with the nR values, we find similar H2
formation rates for the three stars of about R = 4 e-17 cm3/s.
  Because the target stars do not interact with the absorbing matter we can
show that the H2 excitation in the J>2 levels cannot be accounted for by the UV
pumping of the cold H2 but implies collisional excitation in regions where the
gas is much warmer. The existence of warm H2 is corroborated by the fact that
the star with the largest column density of CH+ has the largest amount of warm
H2.

indicate a slowing-down of the spin-fluctuations, upon lowering the
temperature, similar to that observed in Kondo lattices. The temperature
dependence of the quasi-elastic neutron signal is compatible with a
crystal-electric field scheme having a $\Gamma_7^{\rm CEF}$ ground state. The
muon depolarization rate exhibits an additional contribution upon decreasing
the temperature below $T_{\rm c}$ suggesting a close interplay between magnetic
fluctuations and the superconducting state.

significant attention in single-agent settings. It is also a key problem in
multiagent systems, but has received little attention here so far. In this
setting, the agents may have different preferences that often must be
aggregated using voting. This leads to interesting issues because what, if any,
information should be elicited from an agent depends on what other agents have
revealed about their preferences so far.
  In this paper we study effective elicitation, and its impediments, for the
most common voting protocols. It turns out that in the Single Transferable Vote
protocol, even knowing when to terminate elicitation is mathcal NP-complete,
while this is easy for all the other protocols under study. Even for these
protocols, determining how to elicit effectively is NP-complete, even with
perfect suspicions about how the agents will vote. The exception is the
Plurality protocol where such effective elicitation is easy.
  We also show that elicitation introduces additional opportunities for
strategic manipulation by the voters. We demonstrate how to curtail the space
of elicitation schemes so that no such additional strategic issues arise.

systems. The key difficulty is that the agents may report their preferences
insincerely. Mechanism design is the art of designing the rules of the game so
that the agents are motivated to report their preferences truthfully and a
(socially) desirable outcome is chosen. We propose an approach where a
mechanism is automatically created for the preference aggregation setting at
hand. This has several advantages, but the downside is that the mechanism
design optimization problem needs to be solved anew each time. Focusing on
settings where side payments are not possible, we show that the mechanism
design problem is NP-complete for deterministic mechanisms. This holds both for
dominant-strategy implementation and for Bayes-Nash implementation. We then
show that if we allow randomized mechanisms, the mechanism design problem
becomes tractable. In other words, the coordinator can tackle the computational
complexity introduced by its uncertainty about the agents' preferences by
making the agents face additional uncertainty. This comes at no loss, and in
some cases at a gain, in the (social) objective.

use the 3-space approach to construct a 1-parameter family of theories which
generalize strong gravity. The usual strong gravity is the strong-coupled limit
of GR, which is appropriate near singularities and is one of very few regimes
of GR which is amenable to quantization. Our new strong gravity theories are
similar limits of scalar-tensor theories such as Brans--Dicke theory, and are
likewise appropriate near singularities. They represent an extension of the
regime amenable to quantization, which furthermore spans two qualitatively
different types of inner product.
  We find that strong gravity theories permit coupling only to ultralocal
matter fields and that they prevent gauge theory. Thus in the classical
picture, gauge theory breaks down (rather than undergoing unification) as one
approaches the GR initial singularity.

Multiverse) - a member of a growing community of universes, each one being born
in a bounce following the formation of a black hole. In the course of this, the
values of the free parameters of the physical laws are reprocessed and slightly
changed. This leads to an evolutionary picture of the Multiverse, where
universes with more black holes have more descendants. Smolin concludes, that
due to this kind of Cosmological Natural Selection our own universe is the way
it is. The hospitality for life of our universe is seen as an offshot of this
self-organized process. - This paper outlines Smolin's hypothesis, its
strength, weakness and limits, its relationship to the anthropic principle and
evolutionary biology, and comments on the hypothesis from different points of
view: physics, biology, philosophy of science, philosophy of nature, and
metaphysics. Some of the main points are: (1) There is no necessary connection
between black holes and life. In principle, life and Cosmological Natural
Selection could be independent of each other. Smolin might explain the
so-called fine-tuning of physical constants, but life remains an epiphenomenon.
(2) The Darwinian analogy is an inadequate model transfer. The fitness of
Smolin's universes is not constrained by its environment, but by only one
internal factor: the numbers of black holes. Furthermore, although Smolin's
universes have different reproduction rates, they are not competing against
each other. (3) Smolin's central claim cannot be falsified.

the probability of a detection error when distinguishing between a collection
of quantum states, represented by a set of density operators. We show that the
design of the optimal detector can be formulated as a semidefinite programming
problem. Based on this formulation, we derive a set of necessary and sufficient
conditions for an optimal quantum measurement. We then show that the optimal
measurement can be found by solving a standard (convex) semidefinite program
followed by the solution of a set of linear equations or, at worst, a standard
linear programming problem. By exploiting the many well-known algorithms for
solving semidefinite programs, which are guaranteed to converge to the global
optimum, the optimal measurement can be computed very efficiently in polynomial
time.
  Using the semidefinite programming formulation, we also show that the rank of
each optimal measurement operator is no larger than the rank of the
corresponding density operator. In particular, if the quantum state ensemble is
a pure-state ensemble consisting of (not necessarily independent) rank-one
density operators, then we show that the optimal measurement is a pure-state
measurement consisting of rank-one measurement operators.
