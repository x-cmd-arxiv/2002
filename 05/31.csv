network of low-tension domain walls provides an alternative to the commonly
discussed cosmological constant and scalar-field quintessence models of dark
energy. We quantify the lower bound on the number density of the domain walls
that follows from the observed near-isotropy of the cosmic microwave background
radiation. This bound can be satisfied by a strongly frustrated domain wall
network. No fine-tuning of the parameters of the underlying field theory model
is required. We briefly outline the observational consequences of this model.

of functions, and to decide whether a certain functional form allows for a good
fit of the data. Common goodness of fit methods are based on the calculation of
the distribution of certain statistical quantities under the assumption that
the model under consideration {\it holds true}. This proceeding bears
methodological flaws, e.g. a good ``fit'' - albeit the model is wrong - might
be due to over-fitting, or to the fact that the chosen statistical criterion is
not powerful enough against the present particular deviation between model and
true regression function. This causes particular difficulties when models with
different numbers of parameters are to be compared. Therefore the number of
parameters is often penalised additionally. We provide a methodology which
circumvents these problems to some extent. It is based on the consideration of
the error distribution of the goodness of fit criterion under a broad range of
possible models - and not only under the assumption that a given model holds
true. We present a graphical method to decide for the most evident model from a
range of parametric models of the data. The method allows to quantify
statistical evidence {\it for} the model (up to some distance between model and
true regression function) and not only {\it absence of evidence} against, as
common goodness of fit methods do. Finally we apply our method to the problem
of recovering the luminosity density of the Milky Way from a de-reddened {\it
COBE/DIRBE} L-band map. We present statistical evidence for flaring of the
stellar disc inside the solar circle.

abundances observed in some of the most metal poor stars presently known and
the ejecta produced by a generation of primordial core collapse supernovae. We
used five stars which form our initial database and define a ""template"" ultra
metal poor star which is then compared to the theoretical predictions. Our main
findings are as follows: a) the fit to [Si/Mg] and [Ca/Mg] of these very metal
poor stars seems to favor the presence of a rather large C abundance at the end
of the central He burning; in a classical scenario in which the border of the
convective core is strictly determined by the Schwarzschild criterion, such a
large C abundance would imply a rather low C12(alpha,gamma)O16 reaction rate;
b) a low C abundance left by the central He burning would imply a low [Al/Mg]
(<-1.2 dex) independently on the initial mass of the exploding star while a
rather large C abundance would produce such a low [Al/Mg] only for the most
massive stellar model; c) at variance with current beliefs that it is difficult
to interpret the observed overabundance of [Co/Fe], we find that a mildly large
C abundance in the He exhausted core (well within the present range of
uncertainty) easily and naturally allows a very good fit to [Co/Fe]; d) our
yields allow a reasonable fit to 8 out of the 11 available elemental
abundances; e) within the present grid of models it is not possible to find a
good match of the remaining three elements, Ti, Cr and Ni (even for an
arbitrary choice of the mass cut); f) the adoption of other yields available in
the literature does not improve the fit; g) since no mass in our grid provides
a satisfactory fit to these three elements, even an arbitrary choice of the
initial mass function would not improve their fit.

latter suffers from a plethora of scalar field potentials all leading to
similar late time behaviour of the universe, hence to a lack of predictability.
In this paper, we develop a model independent approach which simply involves
parameterizing the dark energy equation of state in terms of known observables.
This allows to analyse the impact dark energy has had on cosmology without the
need to refer to particular scalar field models and opens up the possibility
that future experiments will be able to constrain the dark energy equation of
state in a model independent manner.

relation between aperture mass within a radius of $260\kpch$, $M_{260}$, and
lens galaxy luminosity, that does not depend on galaxy luminosity, type or
environment. In this paper, we study the cross-correlation between galaxies and
dark matter using galaxy catalogs constructed from a high-resolution N-body
simulation of a $\Lambda$CDM Universe. We show that our simulations reproduce
the McKay et al. results reasonably well. In the simulation, $M_{260}$ is
approximately equal to the halo virial mass for $L_*$ galaxies. $M_{260}$
overestimates the virial mass for fainter galaxies and underestimates it for
brighter galaxies. We use the simulations to show that under certain
circumstances the halo virial mass may be recovered by fitting an NFW profile
to the projected galaxy-mass correlation function. If we apply our method to
the observations, we find that $L_*$ galaxies typically reside in halos of
$\sim 2\times 10^{12} h^{-1} \msun$, consistent with halo masses estimated from
the observed Tully-Fisher relation. In the simulations, the halo virial mass
scales with galaxy luminosity as $L^{1.5}$ for central galaxies in halos and
for galaxies in low-density regions. For satellite galaxies, and for galaxies
in high-density regions, there is no simple relation between galaxy luminosity
and halo mass and care must be exercised when interpreting the lensing results.

a count rate trigger with many accumulation times Dt and energy bands DE, but
the nominal sensitivity is less important than how much fainter a burst could

detection rate depend on the assumed burst population, which can be wildly in
error. I base the fiducial rate on the BATSE observations: 550 bursts per sky
above a peak flux of 0.3 ph/cm^2/s averaged over Dt=1.024s and DE=50-300 keV. I
find that triggering on any value of Dt decreases the average threshold peak
flux on the 1.024s timescale by a factor of 0.6. Extending DE to lower energies
includes the large flux of the X-ray background, increasing the background
count rate; a low energy DE is advantageous only for very soft bursts. Whether
a large fraction of the population of bright bursts is soft is disputed; the
new population of X-ray Flashes is soft but relatively faint.

antiferromagnetic in nature and of the order of a few Kelvins only. Monte Carlo
simulations using the ab initio parameters to define the model Hamiltonian
result in a Neel temperature in rather good agreement with experiment. Spin

somewhere between the completely localized picture derived from experiment and
the more delocalized picture based on local density calculations.

with next neighbor interactions, where the set of redundant variables are the
local block densities $\varrho_i$ of $i$ interacting particles. The idea is to
analyze the decomposition of a given pure system into blocks of $i$ interacting
particles by means of a mapping onto a hard rod mixture. This mapping uses the
local activity of component $i$ of the mixture to control the local association
of $i$ particles of the pure system. Thus it identifies the local particle
density of component $i$ of the mixture with the local block density
$\varrho_i$ of the given system. Consequently, our overcomplete free energy
functional takes on the hard rod mixture form with the set of block densities
$\varrho_i$ representing the sequence of partition functions of the local
aggregates of particle numbers $i$. The system of equations for the local
particle density $\varrho$ of the original system is closed via a subsidiary
condition for the block densities in terms of $\varrho$. Analoguous to the
uniform isothermal-isobaric technique, all our results are expressible in terms
of effective pressures. We illustrate the theory with two standard examples,
the adhesive interaction and the square-well potential. For the uniform case,
our proof of such an overcomplete format is based on the exponential
boundedness of the number of partitions of a positive integer (Hardy-Ramanujan
formula) and on Varadhan's theorem on the asymptotics of a class of integrals.
We also discuss the applicability of our strategy in higher dimensional space,

transport through GB and the microwave response of polycrystal in the crucial
misorientation range $\vartheta < 20-30^{\circ}$ of the exponential drop of the
local critical current density $J_b(\vartheta)$ through GB. An exact solution
for an overdamped periodic AJ vortex structure driven along GB by an arbitrary
time dependent transport current in a dc magnetic field $H>H_{c1}$ is obtained.
The dynamics of the AJ vortex chain is parameterized by solutions of two
coupled first order nonlinear differential equations which describe
self-consistently the time dependence of the vortex velocity and the AJ core
length. Exact formulas for the dc flux flow resistivity $R_f(H)$, and the
nonlinear voltage-current characteristics are obtained. Dynamics of the AJ
vortex chain driven by superimposed ac and dc currents is considered, and
general expressions for a linear complex resistivity $R(\omega)$ and
dissipation of the ac field are obtained. A flux flow resonance is shown to
occur at large dc vortex velocities $v$ for which the imaginary part of
$R(\omega)$ has peaks at the ""washboard"" ac frequency $\omega_0=2\pi v/a$,
where $a$ is the inter vortex spacing. This resonance can cause peaks and
portions with negative differential conductivity on the averaged dc
voltage-current (V-I) characteristics. Ac currents of large amplitude cause
generation of higher voltage harmonics and phase locking effects which manifest
themselves in steps on the averaged dc I-V curves at the Josephson voltages,

Postulated new light particles should have small couplings to the gauge bosons.
Within this context it is natural to assume that the branching fractions of the
light SM-like Higgs boson mimic those in the standard model. This assumption
may be unwarranted, however, if there are non-standard light particles coupled
weakly to the gauge bosons but strongly to the Higgs field. In particular, the
Higgs boson may effectively decay into hadronic jets, possibly without
important bottom or charm flavor content. As an example, we present a simple
extension of the SM, in which the predominant decay of the Higgs boson occurs
into a pair of light bottom squarks that, in turn, manifest themselves as

described, generalizing the asymmetric orientifold construction of one of the
authors. By taking the number of dimensions to be large and turning on fluxes,
dilaton potentials are generated with nontrivial minima at arbitrarily small
cosmological constant and D-dimensional string coupling, separated by a barrier
from a flat-space linear dilaton region, but possibly suffering from strong
coupling problems. The general issue of the decay of a de Sitter vacuum to flat
space is discussed. For relatively small barriers, such decays are described by
gravitational instantons. It is shown that for a sufficiently large potential
barrier, the bubble wall crosses the horizon. At the same time the instanton
decay time exceeds the Poincare recurrence time. It is argued that the
inclusion of such instantons is neither physically meaningful nor consistent
with basic principles such as causality. This raises the possibility that such
de Sitter vacua are effectively stable. In the case of the supercritical flux
models, decays to the linear dilaton region can be forbidden by such large
barriers, but decays to lower flux vacua including AdS minima nevertheless
proceed consistently with this criterion. These models provide concrete
examples in which cosmological constant reduction by flux relaxation can be
explored.

conjecture, the positive virtual b_1 conjecture and the virtually fibred
conjecture. We explore the interaction of these conjectures with the following
seemingly unrelated areas: eigenvalues of the Laplacian, and Heegaard
splittings.
  We first give a necessary and sufficient condition, in terms of spectral
geometry, for a finitely presented group to have a finite index subgroup with
infinite abelianisation. For negatively curved 3-manifolds, we show that this
is equivalent to a statement about generalised Heegaard splittings. We also
formulate a conjecture about the behaviour of Heegaard genus under finite
covers which, together with a conjecture of Lubotzky and Sarnak about Property
tau, would imply the virtually Haken conjecture for hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
Along the way, we prove a number of unexpected theorems about 3-manifolds. For
example, we show that for any closed 3-manifold that fibres over the circle
with pseudo-Anosov monodromy, any cyclic cover dual to the fibre of
sufficiently large degree has an irreducible, weakly reducible Heegaard
splitting. Also, we establish lower and upper bounds on the Heegaard genus of
the congruence covers of an arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold, which are linear
in volume.

on an object to the responding acceleration of the object (viz., F=ma). Objects
that exhibit finite accelerations under finite forces are described as being
""massive'' and this mass has usually been considered to be an innate property
of the particles composing the object. However mass itself is never directly
measured. It is inertia, the reaction of the object to impressed forces, that
is measured. We show that the effects of inertia are equally well explained as
a consequence of the vacuum fields acting on massless particles travelling in
geodesic motion. In this approach, the vacuum fields in the particle's history
define the curvature of the particle's spacetime. The metric describing this
curvature implies a transformation to Minkowski spacetime, which we call the
Connective transformation. Application of the Connective transformation
produces the usual effects of inertia when observed in Minkowski spacetime,
including hyperbolic motion in a static electric field (above the vacuum) and
uniform motion following an impulse. In the case of the electromagnetic vacuum
fields, the motion of the massless charge is a helical motion that can be
equated to the particle spin of quantum theory. This spin has the properties
expected from quantum theory, being undetermined until ""measured'' by applying
a field, and then being found in either a spin up or spin down state.
Furthermore, the zitterbewegung of the charge is at the speed of light, again
in agreement with quantum theory. Connectivity also allows for pair creation as
the Connective transformation can transform positive time intervals in the
particle spacetime to negative time intervals in Minkowski spacetime.
