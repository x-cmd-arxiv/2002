Supplemented with astrometry and photometry from the literature, including ten
L and two T dwarfs with parallaxes established by association with bright,
usually HIPPARCOS primaries, this material forms the basis for studying various
color-color and color-absolute magnitude relations. The I-J color is a good
predictor of absolute magnitude for late-M and L dwarfs. M_J becomes
monotonically fainter with I-J color and with spectral type through late-L
dwarfs, then brightens for early-T dwarfs. The combination of zJK colors alone
can be used to classify late-M, early-L, and T dwarfs accurately, and to
predict their absolute magnitudes, but is less effective at untangling the
scatter among mid- and late-L dwarfs. The mean tangential velocity of these
objects is found to be slightly less than that for dM stars in the solar
neighborhood, consistent with a sample with a mean age of several Gyr. Using
colors to estimate bolometric corrections, and models to estimate stellar
radii, effective temperatures are derived. The latest L dwarfs are found to
have T_eff ~ 1360 K.

of groups and clusters of galaxies are a fair representative of the matter mix
of the universe and therefore, can be used to reliably determine the cosmic
mass density parameter Omega_M. However, this fundamental assumption is
challenged by growing evidence from optical and X-ray observations that the
average gas mass fraction and mass-to-light ratio increase mildly with scale
from poor groups to rich clusters. Although a number of time-consuming
hydrodynamical simulations combined with semi-analytic approaches have been
carried out, which permit a sophisticated treatment of some complicated
processes in the formation and evolution of cosmic structures, the essential
physics behind the phenomenon still remains a subject of intense debate. In
this Letter, using a simple analytic model, we show that radiative cooling of
the hot intragroup/intracluster gas may allow one to reproduce the observed
scale-dependence of the global stellar and gas mass fractions and mass-to-light
ratio of groups and clusters, provided that about half of the cooled gas is
converted into stars. Together with the recent success in the recovery of the
entropy excess and the steepening of the X-ray luminosity-temperature relations
detected in groups and clusters, radiative cooling provides a simple, unified
scheme for the evolution of hot gas and the formation of stars in the largest
virialized systems of the universe.

frameworks require significant buy-in, in the form of commitment to a
particular style of programming (e.g., distributed object components). While
this solution is feasible for newer generations of component-based scientific

nightmare. We introduce Weaves a novel framework that enables modeling,
composition, direct code execution, performance characterization, adaptation,
and control of unmodified high performance scientific codes. Weaves is an
efficient generalized framework for parallel compositional modeling that is a
proper superset of the threads and processes models of programming. In this
paper, our focus is on the transparent code execution interface enabled by
Weaves. We identify design constraints, their impact on implementation
alternatives, configuration scenarios, and present results from a prototype

D","Phys.Rev. D65 (2002) 123007","10.1103/PhysRevD.65.123007",,"gr-qc astro-ph",,"  The images of many distant galaxies are displaced, distorted and often
multiplied by the presence of foreground massive galaxies near the line of
sight; the foreground galaxies act as gravitational lenses. Commonly, the lens
equation, which relates the placement and distortion of the images to the real
source position in the thin-lens scenario, is obtained by extremizing the time
of arrival among all the null paths from the source to the observer (Fermat's
principle). We show that the construction of envelopes of certain families of
null surfaces consitutes an alternative variational principle or version of
Fermat's principle that leads naturally to a lens equation in a generic
spacetime with any given metric. We illustrate the construction by deriving the
lens equation for static asymptotically flat thin lens spacetimes. As an
application of the approach, we find the bending angle for moving thin lenses
in terms of the bending angle for the same deflector at rest. Finally we apply
this construction to cosmological spacetimes (FRW) by using the fact they are
all conformally related to Minkowski space.

by truncating sample values which lie in those non-Gaussian tails. The methods
were derived, in the frequentist framework, by minimizing false alarm
probabilities at fixed false detection probability in weak signal limit. For
stochastic signals, the resulting statistic consisted of a sum of an
auto-correlation term and a cross-correlation term; it was necessary to discard
by hand the auto-correlation term to obtain the correct, generalized
cross-correlation statistic. In the present paper, we present an alternative
Bayesian derivation of the same signal detection techniques. We compute the
probability that a signal is present in the data, in the limit where the
signal-to-noise ratio squared per frequency bin is small, where the integrated
signal-to-noise ratio is large compared to one, and where the total probability
in the non-Gaussian tail part of the noise distribution is small. We show that,
for each model considered, the resulting probability is to a good approximation
a monotonic function of the detection statistic derived in the previous paper.
Moreover, for stochastic signals, the new Bayesian derivation automatically
eliminates the problematic auto-correlation term.

in our system, randomly rewiring some of those connections stabilises entire
networks at $x^*$, where $x^*$ is the strongly unstable fixed point solution of
the local chaotic map. In fact, the smallest degree of randomness in spatial
connections opens up a window of stability for the synchronised fixed point in
coupling parameter space. Further, the coupling $\epsilon_{bifr}$ at which the
onset of spatiotemporal synchronisation occurs, scales with the fraction of
rewired sites p as a power law, for 0.1 < p < 1. We also show that the
regularising effect of random connections can be understood from stability
analysis of the probabilistic evolution equation for the system, and
approximate analytical expressions for the range and $\epsilon_{bifr}$ are
obtained.

nuclear and high energy physics experiments. These beams are presently produced
by dc-biased photoelectron sources combined with rf chopping and bunching
systems with inherently high transverse emittances. Low emittances can be
produced with an rf gun, but the vacuum environment has until now been
considered too harsh to support a negative electron affinity GaAs photocathode.
We propose to significantly improve the vacuum conditions by adapting a PWT rf
photoinjector to achieve reasonable cathode emission rates and lifetimes. This
adaptation can also be combined with special optics that will result in a flat
beam with a normalized rms emittance in the narrow dimension that may be as low
as 10-8 m.

inequalities, it is usually assumed that any hidden variables associated with
the nth particle pair would be independent of measurement choices and outcomes
for the first $(n-1)$ pairs. Models which violate this assumption exploit what
we call the {\it memory loophole}. We focus on the strongest type of violation,
which uses the {\it 2-sided} memory loophole, in which the hidden variables for
pair $n$ can depend on the previous measurement choices and outcomes in both
wings of the experiment. We show that the 2-sided memory loophole allows a
systematic violation of the CHSH inequality when the data are analysed in the
standard way, but cannot produce a violation if a CHSH expression depending
linearly on the data is used. In the first case, the maximal CHSH violation
becomes small as the number of particle pairs tested becomes large. Hence,
although in principle the memory loophole implies a slight flaw in existing
analyses of Bell experiments, the data still strongly confirm quantum mechanics
against local hidden variables.
  We consider also a related loophole, the {\it simultaneous measurement
loophole}, which applies if all measurements on each side are carried out
simultaneously. We show that this can increase the probability of violating the
linearised CHSH inequality as well as other Bell-type inequalities.

a very simple method to assess the inseparability of bipartite quantum systems,
which is based on a realigned matrix constructed from the density matrix. For
any separable state, the sum of the singular values of the matrix should be
less than or equal to 1. This condition provides a very simple, computable
necessary criterion for separability, and shows powerful ability to identify
most bound entangled states discussed in the literature. As a byproduct of the
criterion, we give an estimate for the degree of entanglement of the quantum
state.
