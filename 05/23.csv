These constraints are consistent with those found by the BOOMERanG, DASI and

3 arcmin (260 kpc) to 3 keV in the central 5 arcsec (5 kpc) of the cluster,
there is no evidence for gas emitting at temperatures below 3 keV. The addition
of a cooling flow component does not improve the fits, despite previous claims
for a massive cooling flow. There is also no evidence for excess absorption
above the Galactic N_H value. We also observe a steep Fe abundance gradient,
such that Z_Fe >= 2 Z_solar (assuming meteoritic solar Fe abundance) in the

the cD galaxy. The Fe abundance drops to ~0.5 Z_solar at 3 arcmin (260 kpc), in
good agreement with previous BeppoSAX measurements. The high resolution image

(wind) of magnetized moving material developed and partially stabilized the jet
to helical twisting. The fundamental pinch mode was not similarly affected and
emission knots developed in the poloidal simulation. Thus, astrophysical jets
surrounded by outflowing winds could develop knotty structures along a straight
jet triggered by pinching. Where helical twisting dominated the dynamics,
magnetic field orientation along the line-of-sight could be organized by the
toroidal flow field accompanying helical twisting. On astrophysical jets such
structure could lead to a reversal of the direction of Faraday rotation in
adjacent zones along a jet. Theoretical analysis showed that the different
dynamical behavior of the two simulations could be entirely understood as a
result of dependence on the velocity shear between jet and wind which must
exceed a surface Alfven speed before the jet becomes unstable to helical and
higher order modes of jet distortion.

We describe the field selection and observing strategy for these observations.
In the full-resolution images (with synthesised beam of FWHM ~ 17 arcmin) the
thermal noise is typically 45 microK and the CMB signal typically 55 microK.
The noise levels in each field agree well with the expected thermal noise level
of the telescope, and there is no evidence of any residual systematic features.
The same CMB features are detected in separate, overlapping observations.
Discrete radio sources have been detected using a separate 15 GHz survey and
their effects removed using pointed follow-up observations at 34 GHz. We
estimate that the residual confusion noise due to unsubtracted radio sources is
less than 14 mJy/beam (15 microK in the full-resolution images), which added in
quadrature to the thermal noise increases the noise level by 6 %. We estimate
that the rms contribution to the images from diffuse Galactic emission is less
than 6 microK. We also present images which are convolved to maximise the
signal-to-noise of the CMB features and are co-added in overlapping areas, in
which the signal-to-noise of some individual CMB features exceeds 8.

ionized accretion disks, including the effect of the Hall term and ohmic
dissipation, is investigated using local three-dimensional MHD simulations and
various initial magnetic field geometries. When the magnetic Reynolds number,
Re_M \equiv v_A^2 / \eta \Omega (where v_A is the Alfven speed, \eta the
magnetic diffusivity, and \Omega the angular frequency), is initially larger
than a critical value Re_{M, crit}, the MRI evolves into MHD turbulence in
which angular momentum is transported efficiently by the Maxwell stress. If
Re_M < Re_{M, crit}, however, ohmic dissipation suppresses the MRI, and the
stress is reduced by several orders of magnitude. The critical value is in the
range of 1 - 30 depending on the initial field configuration. The Hall effect
does not modify the critical magnetic Reynolds number by much, but enhances the
saturation level of the Maxwell stress by a factor of a few. We show that the
saturation level of the MRI is characterized by v_{Az}^2 / \eta \Omega, where
v_{Az} is the Alfven speed in the nonlinear regime along the vertical component
of the field. The condition for turbulence and significant transport is given
by v_{Az}^2 / \eta \Omega \gtrsim 1, and this critical value is independent of
the strength and geometry of the magnetic field or the size of the Hall term.
If the magnetic field strength in an accretion disk can be estimated
observationally, and the magnetic Reynolds number v_A^2 / \eta \Omega is larger
than about 30, this would imply the MRI is operating in the disk.

provide information complementary to that probed by the Boomerang, DASI,

The UV continuum was $\sim$4 times lower than that observed during 1995 with

of $\sim$8 below that observed with {\it ASCA}. The STIS spectra show kinematic
components of absorption in Ly$\alpha$, C IV, and N V at radial velocities of
-376, -183, and -36 km s$^{-1}$ (components 1, 2, and 3+4, respectively), which
were detected in the earlier GHRS spectra; the last of these is a blend of two
GHRS components that have increased greatly in column density. Four additional
absorption components have appeared in the STIS spectra at radial velocities of
-692, -837, -994, and -1372 km s$^{-1}$ (components 5 through 8); these may
also have been present in earlier low-flux states observed by the {\it

suggest that the components are arranged in increasing radial distance in the
order, 3+4, 2, 1, followed by components 5 -- 8. We have achieved an acceptable
fit to the X-ray data using the combined X-ray opacity of the UV components 1,

previous high states, we are able to match the GHRS C IV column densities,
absence of detectable C IV absorption in components 5 through 8, and the 1994

because of the possible contradiction between the linearly rising rotation
curves observed in some dark-matter-dominated galaxies vs. the $1/r$ density
cusps at the centers of simulated CDM halos. Other CDM issues on small scales
include the very large number of small satellite halos in simulations, far more
than the number of small galaxies observed locally, and problems concerning the

contributions from different masses of the SNe II progenitors that enriched

responsible for this gradient in [Si/Ti] ratios versus Galactocentric distances

bar mode in rigidly rotating equilibrium configurations in the Post-Newtonian
approximation, in order to apply it to neutron stars. The treatment is based on
a precedent Newtonian analytic energy variational method which we have extended
to the Post-Newtonian case. This method, based upon Landau's theory of
second-order phase transitions, provides the critical value of the ellipsoid
polar eccentricity e at the onset of viscosity-driven instability and it is
valid for any equation of state. The extension of this method to Post-Newtonian
fluid configurations has been accomplished by combining two earlier orthogonal
works, specialized respectively to slow rotating configurations but with
arbitrary density profile and to constant mass density but arbitrarily fast
rotating ellipsoids. We also determine the explicit expressions for the density
functionals which allow the generalization of the physical quantities involved
in our treatment from the constant mass density to an arbitrary density profile
form. We find that, considering homogeneous ellipsoids, the value of the
critical eccentricity increases as the stars become more relativistic, in
qualitatively agreement with previous investigations but with a less relevant
amount of such an increase. Studying then the dependence of this critical value
on the configuration equation of state, we find that for polytropic matter
distributions the increase of the critical eccentricity with the star
compactness is confirmed for softer equations of state (with respect to the
incompressible case). The amount of this stabilizing effect is nearly
independent of the polytropic index.

luminous early-stage merger, taken with the ISOCAM camera on-board ISO. We find
that only 40% of the mid-infrared (MIR) flux is associated with a compact
nuclear region, while the rest of the emission originates from a rather diffuse
component extended over several kpc. This is in stark contrast with the very
compact MIR starbursts usually seen in luminous infrared galaxies. A secondary
peak of MIR emission is associated with an extra-nuclear star forming region
which displays the largest Halpha equivalent width in the whole system.
Comparing our data with the distribution of the molecular gas and cold dust, as
well as with radio observations, it becomes evident that the conversion of
molecular gas into stars can be triggered over large areas at the very first
stages of an interaction. The presence of a very strong continuum at 5 microns
in one of the sources indicates that an enshrouded active galactic nucleus may
contribute to 40% of its MIR flux. We finally note that the relative variations
in the UV to radio spectral properties between the merging galaxies provide
evidence that the extinction-corrected star formation rate of similar objects

place a firm lower limit on the ratio of jet (synchrotron) to X-ray

patterns for description (such as meta-classes and homomorphisms between schema
layers), which are prominent in the object-oriented programming community,
constitute a generalization of this graph simulation approach.
  In this paper, we show description applicable to a wide range of data models
that have some notion of object (-identity), and propose to turn it into a data
model primitive much like, say, inheritance. We argue that such an extension
fills a practical need in contemporary data management. Then, we present
algebraic techniques for query optimization (using the notions of described and
description queries). Finally, in the semistructured setting, we discuss the
pruning of regular path queries (with nested conditions) using description
meta-data. In this context, our notion of meta-data extends graph schemata and
data guides by meta-level values, allowing to boost query performance and to
reduce the redundancy of data.

According to our analysis the critical value of the ratio of the kinetic energy

crit}$ for compaction parameter as high as 0.275 is only 30% higher than the
Newtonian value. The critical value of the eccentricity depends very weakly on

stochastic processes of significance for probability and statistical physics,
including percolation, Ising, and Potts models; in addition, their study has
impact on the theory of certain random combinatorial structures, and of
electrical networks. Much (but not all) of the physical theory of Ising/Potts
models is best implemented in the context of the random-cluster representation.
This systematic summary of random-cluster models includes accounts of the
fundamental methods and inequalities, the uniqueness and specification of
infinite-volume measures, the existence and nature of the phase transition, and
the structure of the subcritical and supercritical phases. The theory for
two-dimensional lattices is better developed than for three and more
dimensions. There is a rich collection of open problems, including some of
substantial significance for the general area of disordered systems, and these
are highlighted when encountered. Amongst the major open questions, there is
the problem of ascertaining the exact nature of the phase transition for
general values of the cluster-weighting factor q, and the problem of proving
that the critical random-cluster model in two dimensions, with 1\le q\le 4,
converges when re-scaled to a stochastic L\""owner evolution. Overall the
emphasis is upon the random-cluster model for its own sake, rather than upon
its applications to Ising and Potts systems.

with respect to these coordinates, a Hamiltonian and first integrals depend
only on the action ones. We introduce a suitable perturbation of a Hamiltonian
by a term containing time-dependent parameters so that an evolution of action
variables is nothing else than a displacement along a curve in a parameter
space. Therefore, one can define this evolution in full by an appropriate
choice of parameter functions. Similar holonomy controllability of finite level
quantum systems is of special interes in connection with quantum computation.
We provide geometric quantization of a time-dependent completely integrable

integrals have time-independent countable spectra. The holonomy control

D mesons produced in hadronization can further produce J/psi particles. Using a
multiphase transport model, we investigate the effect on the rapidity
distribution of the produced J/psi particles with two different charm quark
fragmentation functions. It is shown that the J/psi rapidity distribution is
sensitive to the nuclear modification of charm quark fragmentation and thus is
a good indicator of the onset of string melting and the production of
deconfined partonic matter.

in X-ray range. An approach is based on generation of 8th harmonic of radiation
in a multistage HGHG FEL (high gain high harmonic free electron laser)
configuration starting from shot noise. Single-spike phenomena occurs when
electron bunch is passed through the sequence of four relatively short
undulators. The first stage is a conventional ""long"" wavelength (0.8 nm) SASE
FEL which operates in the high-gain linear regime. The 0.1 nm wavelength range
is reached by successive multiplication (0.8 nm $\to$ 0.4 nm $\to$ 0.2 nm $\to$
0.1 nm) in a stage sequence. Our study shows that the statistical properties of
the high-harmonic radiation from the SASE FEL, operating in linear regime, can
be used for selection of radiation pulses with a single spike in time domain.
The duration of the spikes is in attosecond range. Selection of single-spike
high-harmonic pulses is achieved by using a special trigger in data acquisition
system. The potential of X-ray SASE FEL at TESLA at DESY for generating
attosecond pulses is demonstrated. Since the design of XFEL laboratory at TESLA
is based on the use of long SASE undulators with tunable gap, no special place
nor additional FEL undulators are required for attophysics experiments. The use
of a 10 GW-level attosecond X-ray pulses at X-ray SASE FEL facility will enable
us to track processes inside atoms.

sudden, acausal state-vector changes (""collapses"") characteristic of quantum

special relativity appears to be solved by the assumption, essentially the same
as one first used by Aharonov, Bergmann, and Lebowitz to address a different
problem, that the ""initial"" and ""final"" state vectors of a phenomenon or
observation, along with certain other state vectors, all represent the system's
state at all times. Each member of such an aggregate of state vectors is
postulated to represent a different aspect of a physical state rather than a
state, so that most of the state vectors in effect constitute a set of nonlocal
hidden variables. Various implications of this assumption are illustrated
through several physical situations. Among the results is a somewhat surprising
resolution of a paradox in a three-spin Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger experiment
(a ""three-particle EPR"" experiment), which involves a logical consequence that
differs from familiar ideas of quantum physics that has no practical
experimental consequence, and the prediction of new experimental phenomena
related to the Zou-Wang-Mandel superposed-idler system. The potential value of
the concepts described as heuristics for new predictions and for developing
physical intuition by clarifying the interrelation and coherence of physical
principles that would otherwise seem contradictory is briefly discussed.
