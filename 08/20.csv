pattern with a characteristic scale of 30 Mm. It is superficially similar to
the well understood granulation that operates at the 1.5 Mm natural scale of

its origin in the convective motion of cells of gas, though this does not
explain the observation that the supergranulation pattern appears to move
faster around the Sun than the bulk of its surface. A wave origin has been
proposed for supergranulation that may explain the superrotation, but it has
never had much support. Here we report that the supergranulation pattern has
oscillatory components with periods of 5-10 days, for which the best
explanation is a spectrum of traveling waves. We show that there is excess

structure along the line of sight also contributes to the lensing signal, and
consequently affects the measurements. We quantify the effect of distant
uncorrelated large scale structure on the inferred mass profile of clusters as
measured from weak lensing. We consider NFW profiles, and find that large scale
structure is a major source of uncertainty for most practical situations, when
a model, with the mass M_200 and the concentration parameter c as free
parameters, is fit to the observations. We find that the best constraints are
found for clusters at intermediate redshifts (z~0.3). For a cluster at z=0.3,
optimal results are obtained when the lensing signal is measured out to 10-15
arcminutes. Measurements at larger radii do not improve the accuracy with which
the profile can be determined, contrary to what is expected when the
contribution from large scale structure is ignored. The true uncertainties in
M_200 and the concentration parameter c are ~2 times larger than when distant
large scale structure is not included in the error budget.

Theoretical works and observations seem to indicate that the fraction, f_esc,

small in the local universe (f_esc < 10%). At high redshift galaxies are more
compact and probably gas rich implying smaller values of f_esc from their disks

f_esc should be about one. This star formation scenario is consistent with
several models for globular clusters formation. Using simple arguments based on

measurements at the Arecibo Observatory. We have significantly improved our
solution for the astrometric, spin, and orbital parameters of the system, as
well as for the five ""post-Keplerian"" orbital parameters that can be used to
test gravitation theory. The results are in good agreement with the predictions
of general relativity.
  With the assumption that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity
in the classical regime, our measurements allow us to determine the masses of
the pulsar and its companion neutron star with high accuracy: 1.3332 \pm 0.0010
Msun and 1.3452 \pm 0.0010Msun, respectively. The small but significant mass
difference is difficult to understand in most evolutionary models, as the
pulsar is thought to have been born first from a more massive progenitor star
and then undergone a period of mass accretion before the formation of the
second neutron star.
  PSR B1534+12 has also become a valuable probe of the local interstellar
medium. We have now measured the pulsar distance to be 1.02 \pm 0.05 kpc,
giving a mean electron density along this line of sight of 0.011/cc. We
continue to measure a gradient in the dispersion measure, though the rate of
change is now slower than in the first years after the pulsar's discovery.

two- and three-point correlations, a skewness parameter can be defined which is
shown to be virtually independent on the shape and normalisation of the
dark-matter power spectrum. If the galaxy bias is linear and deterministic, the
skewness depends on the cosmic matter density parameter Omega_0 only;
otherwise, it can be used to probe the linearity and stochasticity of the bias.
We finally estimate the signal-to-noise ratio of a skewness determination and

assumed to be approximately perpendicular, eventhough this is not currently an
observational requirement. On the contrary, in one of the few systems where the
relative orientations are well-constrained, V4641Sgr, the jet axis is known to
lie not more than ~36 degrees from the binary plane. Such a jet, lying close to
the binary plane, and traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light
may periodically impact the secondary star initiating nuclear reactions on its
surface. The integrated yield of such nuclear reactions over the age of the
binary system (less the radiative mass loss) will detectably alter the
elemental abundances of the companion star. This scenario may explain the
anomalously high Li enhancements (roughly ~20-200 times the sun's photospheric
value; or, equivalently, 0.1-1 times the average solar system value) seen in
the companions of some black-hole X-ray binary systems. (Such enhancements are
puzzling since Li nuclei are exceedingly fragile - being easily destroyed in
the interiors of stars - and Li would be expected to be depleted rather than
enhanced there.) Gamma-ray line signatures of the proposed process could
include the 2.22 MeV neutron capture line as well as the 0.478 MeV 7Li*
de-excitation line, both of which may be discernable with the INTEGRAL
satellite if produced in an optically thin region during a large outburst. For
very energetic jets, a relatively narrow neutral pion gamma-decay signature at
67.5 MeV could also be measurable with the GLAST satellite. We argue that about

doping. As we illustrate, a unifying underlying principle for the dynamics of
holes introduced by doping rationalizes the emergence of nonuniform electronic
structures- ""stripes"" and possible pairing tendencies therein. Specifically,
our analysis invokes the following (numerically verified) sublattice parity
principle: a strong antiferromagnetic background forces injected holes to hop
in steps of two such that they always remain on the same sub lattice. When
applied to a domain wall in an antiferromagnet, this simple principle naturally
gives rise to (bond centered) stripes. We demonstrate that the holes are
self-consistently localized on stripes. Extending this picture, we then show
that the holes on a stripe favor the formation of pairs on neighboring rungs or
sites. Throughout this work much emphasis is placed on the problem of a two leg
ladder immersed in a staggered magnetic field. Although we will focus on the
square lattice, our considerations may be extended to similar electronic
structures appearing in other models on bipartite lattices when these exhibit

presence of frustration and quenched disorder. The analysis is motivated by
recent transport experiments on artificial vortex-flow channels in
superconducting thin films. We start with a London description of the vortices
and then map the problem onto a generalized Frenkel-Kontorova model and its
continuous equivalent, the sine-Gordon model. In the absence of disorder,
frustration reduces the depinning threshold in the commensurate phase, which
nearly vanishes in the incommensurate regime. Depinning of the driven
frustrated chain occurs via unstable configurations that are localized at the
boundaries of the sample and evolve into topological defects which move freely
through the entire sample. In the presence of disorder, topological defects can
also be generated in the bulk. Further, disorder leads to pinning of
topological defects. We find that weak disorder effectively reduces the
depinning threshold in the commensurate phase, but increases the threshold in
the incommensurate phase.

  experience","48 pages, to appear in the journal ""Theory and Practice of Logic

major paradigms. A multiparadigm language is designed to support different
programming paradigms (logic, functional, constraint, object-oriented,
sequential, concurrent, etc.) with equal ease. This article has two goals: to
give a tutorial of logic programming in Oz and to show how logic programming
fits naturally into the wider context of multiparadigm programming. Our
experience shows that there are two classes of problems, which we call
algorithmic and search problems, for which logic programming can help formulate
practical solutions. Algorithmic problems have known efficient algorithms.
Search problems do not have known efficient algorithms but can be solved with
search. The Oz support for logic programming targets these two problem classes
specifically, using the concepts needed for each. This is in contrast to the
Prolog approach, which targets both classes with one set of concepts, which
results in less than optimal support for each class. To explain the essential
difference between algorithmic and search programs, we define the Oz execution
model. This model subsumes both concurrent logic programming
(committed-choice-style) and search-based logic programming (Prolog-style).
Instead of Horn clause syntax, Oz has a simple, fully compositional,
higher-order syntax that accommodates the abilities of the language. We
conclude with lessons learned from this work, a brief history of Oz, and many
entry points into the Oz literature.

light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 of a second"". If there
was exactly one single consistent method of synchronizing clocks, or if all
corresponding methods were equivalent, one could infer from the validity of
special relativity theory on a definite value of the one-way speed of light c
in inertial frames.
  It is true that sufficiently slowly separated clocks always show middle in
time reflection when sending and receiving light signals. But a simple
consideration proves that the one-way speed of light is not a constant in
rotating systems, in principle detectable with only one clock.
  On basis of a new internal synchronization method, this also affects all
local inertial frames on rotating Earth, too, violating an absolute constancy
of the one-way speed of light. This is not a contradiction to Einstein's
original theory of relativity but to the present definition of the meter. Based
on the constant local average value c of light going there and back, however, a
modification for the definition of the meter is suggested, which would not
depend on synchronization of any distant clocks.
  Appendix: FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction and time dilation, according to
Einstein's generally accepted understanding, should be purely kinematic effects
and would not need any dynamic explanation. But an analysis of Ehrenfest's
paradox of the rotating disk shows that it is not possible to separate exactly
relativistic kinematics from dynamics. The necessity of such a fundamental
restriction is well known for a long time - though only from quantum mechanics
till now.

values(vevs) in d=4, N=8 gauged supergravity. Especially, the space of
SU(3)-singlet vevs contains various critical points and RG flows(domain walls)
developing along AdS_4 radial coordinate. Based on the nonlinear metric ansatz
of de Wit-Nicolai-Warner, we show the geometric construction of the compact
7-manifold metric and find the local frames(siebenbeins) by decoding the
SU(3)-singlet vevs into squashing and stretching parameters of the 7-manifold.
Then the 11-dimensional metric for the whole SU(3)-invariant sector is obtained
as a warped product of an asymptotically AdS_4 space with a squashed and
stretched 7-sphere. We also discuss the difference in the 7-manifold between
two sectors, namely SU(3)xU(1)-invariant sector and G_2-invariant sector. In
spite of the difference in base 6-sphere, both sectors share the 4-sphere of
CP^2 associated with the common SU(3)-invariance of various 7-manifolds.

the minimal Planck scale into a maximal-acceleration Relativity principle in
the spacetime tangent bundle and in phase spaces (cotangent bundle). Crucial in

The maximal proper-acceleration bound is a = c^2/ \Lambda in full agreement
with the old predictions of Caianiello, the Finslerian geometry point of view
of Brandt and more recent results in the literature. We present the reasons why
an Extended Scale Relativity based on Clifford spaces is physically more
appealing than those based on kappa-deformed Poincare algebras and the
inhomogeneous quantum groups operating in quantum Minkowski spacetimes. The
main reason being that the Planck scale should not be taken as a deformation
parameter to construct quantum algebras but should exist already as the minimum

  Schr\""odinger Equation","29 pages in RevTeX, Added Note, references added",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.67.025007",,"quant-ph",,"  We generalize the Weisskopf-Wigner theory for the line shape and transition
rates of decaying states to the case of the energy-driven stochastic
Schr\""odinger equation that has been used as a phenomenology for state vector
reduction. Within the standard approximations used in the Weisskopf-Wigner
analysis, and assuming that the perturbing potential inducing the decay has
vanishing matrix elements within the degenerate manifold containing the
decaying state, the stochastic Schr\""odinger equation linearizes. Solving the
linearized equations, we find no change from the standard analysis in the line
shape or the transition rate per unit time. The only effect of the stochastic
terms is to alter the early time transient behavior of the decay, in a way that
eliminates the quantum Zeno effect. We apply our results to estimate
experimental bounds on the parameter governing the stochastic effects.

assumption and quantum correlations obtained from maximally entangled spin
states. We analyze these no-go theorems in the framework of Bohm's
interpretation. The mechanism by which non-local correlations appear during the
results of measurements performed on distant parts of entangled systems is
explicitly put into evidence in terms of Bohmian trajectories. It is shown that
a GHZ like contradiction of the type+1=-1 occurs for well-chosen initial
positions of the Bohmian trajectories and that it is this essential
non-classical feature that makes it possible to violate the locality condition.

This protocol interpolates between the Ivanovic-Dieks-Peres scheme and the

operator valued measure describing the discrimination device and establish a
criterion for its optimality. We also devise a numerical method for efficient
solving of these extremal equations.

cannot be rigorously perpendicular to the wave vector because of diffraction
effects. The vacuum behaves as a noisy channel, even if the detectors are
perfect. The ``noise'' can however be reduced and nearly cancelled by a
relative motion of the observer toward the source. The standard definition of a
reduced density matrix fails for photon polarization, because the
transversality condition behaves like a superselection rule. We can however
define an effective reduced density matrix which corresponds to a restricted
class of positive operator-valued measures. There are no pure photon qubits,
and no exactly orthogonal qubit states.

experimental results for a cloud of chromium atoms in a magnetic trap. A simple
model based on rate equations shows quantitative agreement with the
