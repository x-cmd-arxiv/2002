(BX Cir) to determine its effective temperature and gravity throughout its
pulsation cycle. The spectra were also used to measure its chemical abundances.
  We report rest gravity, log g = 3.38 +/- 0.02, and a chemical abundance
mixture consistent with those reported earlier in a study using an optical
spectrum with lower spectral resolution and a lower signal to noise ratio. Our
analysis decreases the upper limit for the H abundance to H < 6.0 (mass
fraction < 7.1 x 10^-7). Our gravity corresponds to stellar mass M = 0.47 +/-
0.03 M_sun.
  We find that the effective log g varies through the pulsation cycle with an
amplitude of 0.28 dex. The effective gravity is smaller than the rest gravity
except when the star is very near its minimum radius. The change in effective
gravity is primarily caused by acceleration of the stellar surface.
  Based on the optical spectra, we find the temperature varies with an
amplitude of 3450 K. We find a time averaged mean temperature, 23390 +/- 90 K,
consistent with that found in the earlier optical spectrum study. The mean
temperature is 1750 K hotter than that found using combined ultraviolet spectra
and V and R photometry and the variation amplitude is larger. This discrepancy
is similar to that found for the extreme helium star V652 Her.

adaptive grid has allowed us to compute models which appropiately cover all
relevant scales of a giant jet, from the ~ 100 AU jet radius close to the
source to the ~ 1 pc length of the outflow. A good qualitative and quantitative
agreement is found between the model predictions and the observations.
Moreover, we show that a critical parameter for obtaining a better or worse
agreement with the observations is the ratio rho_j/rho_a between the jet and
the environmental densities. The implications of this result in the context of

redshift, and model the of repeated supernova explosions driving supershells
out of the disks, using the hydrodynamic simulation code, ZEUS-3D. The amount
of star formation is assumed proportional to mass above some density threshold.
We vary the threshold to explore the range of star formation efficiencies,
f*=0.006, 0.06, and 0.6. We find that the interstellar gas swept up in dense
supershells can effectively trap the ionizing photons, before the supershells
blow out of the disks. The blow-outs then create galactic outflows, chimneys
which allow the photons to escape directly to the intergalactic medium. Our
results are consistent with escape fractions of less than 0.1 measured in local
dwarf starburst galaxies, because they are likely observed while the starbursts
are young, before blow-out. We suggest that high-redshift dwarf starburst

(MSPs) with precise radio positions in the globular clusters 47Tuc (NGC104) and
NGC6397. The 47Tuc MSPs are predominantly soft sources suggestive of thermal
emission from small (r_x < 0.6km) polar caps on the neutron star rather than
magnetospheric emission and are a relatively homogeneous sample, with most
x-ray luminosities in a surprisingly narrow range (Lx ~1-4 X 10^30 erg/s). We
use previously derived intrinsic Pdot values and find a new relation between Lx
and spindown luminosity, Edot: Lx ~ Edot^beta, with beta ~0.5 vs. ~1.0 for both
pulsars and MSPs in the field. This Lx-Edot relation and also the Lx/Edot vs.
spindown age are each similar to that found by Harding & Muslimov (2002) for
thermal emission from polar cap heating although the cluster MSPs are
relatively longer-lived (in thermal x-rays) than either the models or field
MSPs. We suggest the cluster MSPs may have altered surface magnetic field
topology (e.g.multipole) or their neutron stars are more massive from repeated
accretion episodes due to encounters and repeated exchange interactions. MSP
binary companions on or just off the main sequence are likely to have been
re-exchanged and might show anomalous Pdot and Edot values due to relaxation of
misaligned core-crust spins. The radial distribution of 40 soft Chandra sources
in 47Tuc is consistent with a 1.4Msun component. The implied total MSP
population in 47Tuc with Lx >10^30 erg/s is ~35-90, and can constrain the
relative beaming in radio vs. soft x-rays. NGC6397 is relatively deficient in

periastron advance, omega_dot = 0.0116 +/- 0.0008 deg/yr. Interpreted as a
general relativistic effect, this implies the sum of the pulsar mass, m_1, and
the companion mass, m_2, to be M = m_1 + m_2 = 2.81 +/- 0.30 msun. The
Keplerian parameters rule out certain combinations of m_1 and m_2, as does the
non-detection of Shapiro delay in the pulse arrival times. These constraints,
together with the assumption that the companion is a white dwarf, lead to the
68% confidence maximum likelihood values of m_1 = 1.70(+0.32 -0.29) msun and
m_2 =0.97(+0.27 - 0.15) msun and to the 95% confidence maximum likelihood

other major finding is that the pulsar experiences dramatic variability in its
dispersion measure (DM), with gradients as steep as 0.013 pc cm^{-3} / yr. A
structure function analysis of the DM variations uncovers spatial fluctuations
in the interstellar electron density that cannot be fit to a single power law,
unlike the Kolmogorov turbulent spectrum that has been seen in the direction of

center, the water maser emission appears to trace parts of a protostellar disk
and collimated outflow. The disk components are ~9 and ~17 AU long, in IRS3 and
IRS1 respectively, and ~2 AU wide. They are identified as disks by their
compact size, elongation parallel to the direction of known IR polarization,
central location in the maser maps, small internal proper motions, and
proximity to 1.3 cm continuum emission. The outflows have axes perpendicular to
the disks and exhibit proper motions of up to ~42 km/sec. They are outlined by
maser emission up to ~260 AU from the protostars. The IRS3 outflow appears to
be conical on one side, while the IRS1 outflow comprises a narrowly collimated
bipolar flow surrounded by outward-facing, funnel-shaped cavities. The
detection of water maser emission tracing such compact disk components and
specifically conical or funnel-shaped structures is unusual. The fact that the

appealing way of generating an exponential stellar profile over many scale
lengths, almost independent of initial conditions, requiring only that the
viscous timescale and star formation timescale are approximately equal.
However, galaxies with solid-body rotation curves cannot undergo viscous
evolution. Low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies have exponential surface
brightness profiles, yet have slowly rising, nearly solid-body, rotation
curves. Because of this, viscous evolution may be inefficient in LSB galaxies:
the exponential profiles, instead would give important insight into initial
conditions for galaxy disk formation.
  Using star formation laws from the literature, and tuning the efficiency of
viscous processes to reproduce an exponential stellar profile in Milky Way-type
galaxies, I test the role of viscous evolution in LSB galaxies. Under the
conservative and not unreasonable condition that LSB galaxies are
gravitationally unstable for at least a part of their lives, I find that it is
impossible to rule out a significant role for viscous evolution. This type of
model still offers an attractive way of producing exponential disks, even in
LSB galaxies with slowly-rising rotation curves.

order to mimic the gas ejection process from the Be star, we inject particles
with the Keplerian rotation velocity at a radius just outside the star. Both Be
star and neutron star are treated as point masses. We find that the Be-star
disc is effectively truncated if the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter
alpha_SS >> 1, which confirms the previous semi-analytical result. In the
truncated disc, the material decreted from the Be star accumulates, so that the
disc becomes denser more rapidly than if around an isolated Be star. The
resonant truncation of the Be disc results in a significant reduction of the
amount of gas captured by the neutron star and a strong dependence of the mass
capture rate on the orbital phase. We also find that an eccentric mode is
excited in the Be disc through direct driving due to a one-armed bar potential
of the binary. The strength of the mode becomes greater in the case of a
smaller viscosity. In a high-resolution simulation with alpha_SS=0.1, the
eccentric mode is found to precess in a prograde sense. The mass capture rate

atomic O; their energies correspond to two distinct spin states of
photo-ionized O atoms. The remaining edge component is considered to represent
compound forms of oxide dust grains. Since Cyg X-2 is about 1.4 kpc above the
galactic disk, the H column densities can be determined by radio (21 cm and CO
emission line) and H alpha observations with relatively small uncertainties.
Thus the O abundance relative to H can be determined from the absorption edges.
We found that the dust scattering can affect the apparent depth of the edge of
the compound forms. We determined the amplitude of the effect, which we
consider is the largest possible correction factor. The ratio of column
densities of O in atomic to compound forms and the O total abundance were
respectively determined to be in the range 1.7^{+3.0}_{-0.9} to
2.8^{+5.1}_{-1.5} (ratio), and 0.63 +/- 0.12 solar to 0.74 +/- 0.14 solar
(total), taking into account the uncertainties in the dust-scattering
correction and in the ionized H column density. We also determined the Ne
abundance from the absorption edge to be 0.75 +/- 0.20 solar. These abundance
values are smaller than the widely-used solar values but consistent with the
latest estimates of solar abundance.

close-binary systems. The majority of all interacting binaries with a compact
object in their system (e.g. cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries) are thought
to have passed through a common-envelope (CE) phase. Current models of
interacting binaries all assume, as a starting point, that there is no
significant modification of the secondary star compared with a normal star of
similar spectral type. The extent to which the CE significantly alters the
composition of the secondary star has yet to be determined.
  We are studying the M-type secondary in the pre-CV system EG UMa, in order to
determine its atmospheric parameters by comparison with synthetic spectra
generated using PHOENIX. Absorption lines due to several elements have been
used in investigating the stellar parameters of effective temperature, gravity
and over elemental abundance. In addition, we are searching for anomalies due
to s-process elements (such as Ba, Sr, Rb, Y), which may have been deposited in
the atmosphere during the CE stage, and prove that CE evolution has occurred.
  EG UMa displays strong YO absorption bands, which are normally associated
with giants and S stars. These bands may have been formed as a result of an
Y-abundance enhancement introduced by the CE, which would be consistent with
the observed possible Rb and Sr enrichment.

other combination of parameters will not do even better? Computers are now
sufficiently powerful and inexpensive that we can produce large grids of models

decaying high-speed turbulence in dense molecular clouds. We compare our
results, which include a detailed cooling function, molecular hydrogen
chemistry and a limited C and O chemistry, to those previously obtained for
decaying isothermal turbulence.
  After an initial phase of shock formation, power-law decay regimes are
uncovered, as in the isothermal case. We find that the turbulence decays faster
than in the isothermal case because the average Mach number remains higher, due
to the radiative cooling. The total thermal energy, initially raised by the
introduction of turbulence, decays only a little slower than the kinetic
energy.
  We discover that molecule reformation, as the fast turbulence decays, is
several times faster than that predicted for a non-turbulent medium. This is
caused by moderate speed shocks which sweep through a large fraction of the
volume, compressing the gas and dust. Through reformation, the molecular
density and molecular column appear as complex patterns of filaments, clumps
and some diffuse structure. In contrast, the molecular fraction has a wider
distribution of highly distorted clumps and copious diffuse structure, so that
density and molecular density are almost identically distributed during the
reformation phase. We conclude that molecules form in swept-up clumps but
effectively mix throughout via subsequent expansions and compressions.

form of a Gaussian random field that evolves under the action of gravitational
instability. In the early stages, while they have low amplitude, the
fluctuations grow linearly. During this phase the Gaussian character of the
fluctuations is preserved. Later on, when the fluctuations have amplitude of
order the mean density or larger, non-linear effects cause departures from
Gaussianity. In Fourier space, non-linearity is responsible for coupling
Fourier modes and altering the initially random distribution of phases that
characterizes Gaussian initial conditions. In this paper we investigate some of
the effects of quadratic non-linearity on basic statistical properties of
cosmological fluctuations. We demonstrate how this form of non-linearity can
affect asymptotic properties of density fields such as homogeneity, ergodicity,
and behaviour under smoothing. We also show how quadratic density fluctuations
give rise to a particular relationship between the phases of different Fourier
modes which, in turn, leads to the generation of a non-vanishing bispectrum. We
thus elucidate the relationship between higher-order power spectra and phase
distributions.

gels formed by aerosil dispersions. For all densities of aerosil and all
measurement temperatures, the correlations remain short range, demonstrating
that the disorder imposed by the gels destroys the nematic (N) to smectic-A
(SmA) transition. The smectic correlation function contains two distinct
contributions. The first has a form identical to that describing the critical
thermal fluctuations in pure 8CB near the N-SmA transition, and this term
displays a temperature dependence at high temperatures similar to that of the
pure liquid crystal. The second term, which is negligible at high temperatures
but dominates at low temperatures, has a shape given by the thermal term
squared and describes the static fluctuations due to random fields induced by
confinement in the gel. The correlation lengths appearing in the thermal and
disorder terms are the same and show strong variation with gel density at low
temperatures. The temperature dependence of the amplitude of the static
fluctuations further suggests that nematic susceptibility become suppressed
with increasing quenched disorder. The results overall are well described by a
mapping of the liquid crystal-aerosil system into a three dimensional XY model
in a random field with disorder strength varying linearly with the aerosil
density.

electron size-quantized subbands are considered. The photocurrent excitation
spectrum is shown to depend strongly on the form of the spin-orbit interaction.
In the case of structure inversion asymmetry induced (Rashba) spin-splitting,
the current is a linear function of light frequency near the absorption edge,
and for the higher excitation energy the spectrum changes its sign and has a
minimum. In contrast, when the bulk inversion asymmetry (Dresselhaus splitting)
dominates, the photocurrent edge behavior is parabolic, and then the spectrum
is sign-constant and has a maximum.

Nevertheless, the approach turned out to be restricted to relatively small

multi-cycloid curves instead. Besides its higher precision at given order, the
method has the advantages of giving a transparent physical meaning to the
appearance of cusp singularities and of not being restricted to interfaces
representable as single-valued functions. Using a single cycloid as ansatz
function, the entire calculation can be performed analytically, which gives a
good qualitative overview of the system. Taking into account several but few
cycloid modes, we obtain remarkably good quantitative agreement with previous
numerical calculations. With a few more modes taken into consideration, we
improve on the accuracy of those calculations. Our approach extends them to
situations involving gravity effects. Results on the shape of steady-state
solutions are presented at both large stresses and amplitudes. In addition,
their stability is investigated.

an exception rather than as a rule. The thermodynamic driving force of
formation of coherent 3D islands on the wetting layer of the same material is
the weaker adhesion of the atoms near the islands edges. The average adhesion
gets weaker with increasing island's thickness but reaches a saturation after
several monolayers. A misfit greater than a critical value is a necessary
condition for coherent 3D islanding. Monolayer height islands with a critical
size appear as necessary precursors of the 3D islands. The 2D-3D transformation

Naively these vertex operators are in one-to-one correspondence with certain

subtlety in the physics of the open string B model has the effect of physically
realizing those spectral sequences in BRST cohomology, so that the vertex

  By analyzing the progress rate of the growth process we show that a.s. the

results from the physics literature. Additionally, the boundary component of
the ball of radius r separating it from infinity a.s. has growth rate r^2 up to

it is shown that a.s. the critical probability p_c=1/2 and that at p_c

by a quark in one nucleon followed by its high momentum transfer interaction
with a quark of the other nucleon leads to the production of two nucleons with
high relative momentum. We sum the relevant quark rescattering diagrams, and
demonstrate that the scattering amplitude can be expressed as a convolution of
the large angle NN scattering amplitude, the hard photon-quark interaction
vertex and the low-momentum nuclear wave function. Within this model we
calculate the cross sections and polarization observables of high energy gamma

  10-15 June, 2002",,,,"nucl-th hep-ph",,"  A searche for supernarrow dibaryons (SND) and exotic baryons with small
masses is reviewed. As a result of the study of the reaction pd->p+pX_1, three
narrow peaks at M_{pX_1}=1904, 1926, and 1942 MeV have been observed. The
analysis of the angular distributions of the protons from the decay of the pX_1
states showed that the peaks found can be explained as a manifestation of the
isovector SNDs, the decay of which into two nucleons is forbidden by the Pauli
exclusion principle. The observation of the peaks in the missing mass M_{X_1}
spectra at 966, 986, and 1003 MeV is an additional indication that the
dibaryons found are the SNDs. The possible interpretation of these peaks in the
M_{X_1} mass spectra and peaks observed in the reaction pp->pi^+pX at M_X=1004,
1044, and 1094 MeV as new exotic baryon states with small masses is discussed.
The mass equation has been constructed which is used to calculate the masses
and determine parities of the exotic baryons. The obtained values of the masses
are in a good agreement with the experimental data. Two new exotic baryon
states bellow the \pi production threshold have been predicted.

will is possible because there is an ontological indeterminism in the natural

matter, which leads to a choice among the different possibilities for the body.
However, I defend the opposite thesis, that free will cannot be defended in
terms of QM. First, because indeterminism does not imply free will, it is
merely a necessary condition but not enough to defend it. Second, because all
considerations about an autonomous mind sending orders to the body is against
our scientific knowledge about human beings; in particular, neither
neurological nor evolutionary theory can admit dualism. The quantum theory of
measurement can be interpreted without the intervention of human minds, but
other fields of science cannot contemplate the mentalist scenario, so it is
concluded that QM has nothing to say about the mind or free will, and its
scientific explanation is more related to biology than to physics. A fatalistic
or materialist view, which denies the possibility of a free will, makes much
more sense in scientific terms.
