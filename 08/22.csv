this paper, we use the detector response to Cherenkov emission from cosmic ray

brightness (SB) profile is decomposed into a sum of a generalized Sersic bulge
and an exponential disk. The reliability and limitations of our bulge-to-disk
(B/D) decompositions are tested with extensive simulations of galaxy brightness
profiles (1D) and images (2D). Galaxy types are divided into 3 classes
according to their SB profile shapes; Freeman Type-I and Type-II, and a third
``Transition'' class for galaxies whose profiles change from Type-II in the
optical to Type-I in the infrared. We discuss possible interpretations of
Freeman Type-II profiles. The Sersic bulge shape parameter for nearby Type-I
late-type spirals shows a range between n=0.1-2 but, on average, the underlying
surface density profile for the bulge and disk of these galaxies is adequately
described by a double-exponential distribution. We confirm a coupling between
the bulge and disk with a scale length ratio r_e/h=0.22+/-0.09, or
h_bulge/h_disk=0.13+/-0.06 for late-type spirals, in agreement with recent
N-body simulations of disk formation and models of secular evolution. This
ratio increases from ~0.20 for late-type spirals to ~0.24 for earlier types.
The similar scaling relations for early and late-type spirals suggest
comparable formation and/or evolution scenarios for disk galaxies of all Hubble
types.

is discussed based on various astrophysical contexts. In order to emit GW
radiation, the disk shape should lose axial symmetry. We point out that a
significant deformation is plausible in non-radiative hot accretion disks
because of enhanced magnetic activity, whereas it is unlikely for standard-type
cool disks. We have analyzed the 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulation data
of magnetized accretion flow, finding non-axisymmetric density patterns. The
corresponding ellipticity is $\epsilon \sim 0.01$. The expected time variations
of GW radiation are overall chaotic, but there is a hint of quasi-periodicity.
GW radiation has no interesting consequence, however, in the case of close
binaries, because of very tiny disk masses. GW radiation is not significant,
either, for AGN because of very slow rotation velocities. The most promising
case can be found in gamma-ray bursts or supernovae, in which a massive torus
(or disk) with a solar mass or so may be formed around a stellar-mass compact
object as the result of a merger of compact objects, or by the fallback of
exploded material towards the center in a supernova. Although much more intense
GW radiation is expected before the formation of the torus, the detection of GW
radiation in the subsequent accretion phase is of great importance, since it
will provide a good probe to investigating their central engines.

predictions of detalied and new non-grey atmospheres, time-dependent element
diffusion and the history of the white dwarf progenitor. Reliable initial
models for low mass HeWDs are obtained by applying mass loss rates to a 1msun
stellar model. The loss of angular momentum caused by gravitational wave
emission and magnetic stellar wind braking are considered. Model atmospheres,
based on a detailed treatment of the microphysics entering the WD atmosphere
enable us to provide accurate colours and magnitudes at both early and advanced
evolutionary stages. We find that most of our evolutionary sequences experience
several episodes of hydrogen thermonuclear flashes. In particular, the lower
the metallicity, the larger the minimum stellar mass for the occurrence fo
flashes induced by CNO cycle reactions. The existence of a mass-threshold for
the occurrence of diffusion-induced CNO flashes leadss to a marked dichotomy in
the age of our models. Another finding of this study is that our HeWD models
experience unstable hydrogen burning via PP nuclear reactions at late cooling
stages as a result of hydrogen chemically diffusing inwards. Such PP flashes
take place in models with very low metal content. We also find that models
experiencing CNO flashes exhibit a pronouncede turn-off in most of their
colours at M_V=16 approximately. Finally, colour-magnitude diagrams for our

study star-formation. The ISOCAM ELAIS survey is found to mostly detect
strongly star-forming late-type galaxies, possibly starburst powered galaxies,

conclude that the drop in the [6.7/15] ratio seen in strongly star-forming

a slider-block model using a state and velocity dependent friction law

the ratio $B/A$ of two parameters of the rate and state friction law and on the
initial frictional state of the sliding surfaces characterized by a reduced

an acceleration of the displacement. We use the slider-block friction model to
analyze quantitatively the displacement and velocity data preceding two
landslides, Vaiont and La Clapi\`ere. The Vaiont landslide was the catastrophic
culmination of an accelerated slope velocity. La Clapi\`ere landslide was
characterized by a peak of slope acceleration that followed decades of ongoing
accelerating displacements, succeeded by a restabilizing phase. Our inversion
of the slider-block model on these data sets shows good fits and suggest to

into an intermittent SNA via a phase-dependent saddle-node bifurcation when it
collides with a new type of ``ring-shaped'' unstable set. Besides this
intermittent transition, other transitions such as the interior, boundary, and
band-merging crises may also occur through collision with the ring-shaped
unstable sets. Hence the ring-shaped unstable sets play a central role for such
dynamical transitions. Furthermore, these kinds of dynamical transitions seem
to be ``universal,'' in the sense that they occur typically in a large class of
quasiperiodically forced period-doubling systems.

model and the two body Dirac equations of constraint dynamics. This approach to
the two body problem has been successfully tested for QED and QCD relativistic
bound states. An important question we wish to address is whether or not the
two body nucleon-nucleon scattering problem can be reasonably described in this
approach as well. This test involves a number of related problems. First we
must reduce our two body Dirac equations exactly to a Schroedinger-like
equation in such a way that allows us to use techniques to solve our two body
Dirac equations already developed for Schroedinger-like systems in
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. Related to this we present a new derivation
of Calogero's variable phase shift differential equation for coupled
Schroedinger-like equations. Then we determine if the use of nine meson
exchanges in our two body Dirac equations give a reasonable fit to the
experimental scattering phase shifts for n-p scattering. The data involves
seven angular momentum states including both singlet and the triplet spin
states with orbital angular momentum 0,1,2. Two models that we have tested give
us a fairly good fit. The parameters obtained by fitting the n-p experimental
scattering phase shift give a fairly good prediction for most of the p-p
experimental scattering phase shifts examined (for the spin singlet S and D
states and spin triplet P states). Thus the two body Dirac equations of
constraint dynamics presents us with a fit that encourages the exploration of a

a viscoelastic fluid. We derive a generalized Darcy's law in the frequency
domain for a linear viscoelastic fluid flowing in a Hele Shaw cell. This leads
to an analytic expression for the dynamic permeability that has maxima which
are several orders of magnitude larger than the static permeability. We then
follow an argument of de Gennes to obtain the smallest possible finger width
when viscoelasticity is important. Using this, and a conservation law, we
obtain a lowest bound for the width of a single finger displacing a
viscoelastic fluid. Our results indicate that when a small amplitude signal of
the frequency that maximizes the permeability is overimposed to a constant
pressure drop, gigantic variations are obtained for the finger width.

treating this structure as a one-dimensional cylindrical photonic crystal
containing a single defect, we are able to push the limits of Q/V beyond those
achievable by standard micropost designs, based on the simple rules established
for planar DBR microcavities. We show that some of the rules that work well for
designing large-diameter microposts (e.g., high-refractive index contrast) fail
to provide high-quality cavities with small diameters. By tuning the
thicknesses of mirror layers and the spacer, the number of mirror pairs, the
refractive indices of high and low refractive index regions, and the cavity
diameter, we are able to achieve Q as high as 10^4, together with a mode volume
of 1.6 cubic wavelengths of light in the high-refractive-index material. The
combination of high Q and small V makes these structures promising candidates
for the observation of such cavity quantum electrodynamics phenomena as strong
coupling between a quantum dot and the cavity field, and single-quantum-dot
lasing.

ground state of a slowly varying Hamiltonian. The ground state of the initial

generally been studied in the case where the ""straight line"" path from initial

involving terms that are not linear combinations of the initial and final
Hamiltonians. We give several proposals for randomly generating new paths.
Using one of these proposals, we convert an algorithmic failure into a success.

after scattering implies that the scattering is of a special type, and only
certain incident waves are admissible. An example, based on the Fermi

different for each transition. The nonunitary time evolution is visualized by
the aid of the Wigner function related to the vibrational state of the

dissipation, and gives rise to states which are mixtures of localized states
along the phase space orbit of the corresponding classical particle. This
behavior is to a large extent independent of the coupling strength, the
temperature of the environment and also of the initial state.
