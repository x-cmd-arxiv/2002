calculate the gravitational clustering of relic neutrinos in realistic
cosmological models dominated by cold dark matter (CDM) and the cosmological
constant. This method can be used to estimate the phase-space distribution of
any light particles in CDM halos. We find that neutrinos with masses > 0.3 eV
cluster appreciably in dark matter halos above the galactic size. The resulting
neutrino overdensity above the cosmic mean neutrino density increases with both
the neutrino mass and the halo mass, ranging from about 10 for 0.3 eV neutrinos
in 10^13 M_sun halos, to about 1500 for 1.8 eV neutrinos in 10^15 M_sun halos.
We examine the implications of neutrino clustering for the Z-burst model of
ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR), which interprets the observed events at
E > 4 x 10^19 eV as decay products of Z-bosons from the resonant scattering
between relic and high energy neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. We estimate the
UHECR energy spectrum for various neutrino masses towards five of the most
massive clusters in the local universe (within 100 Mpc): Virgo, Perseus-Pisces,
Hydra, Centaurus, and Coma. The UHECR flux in the Z-burst model is expected to
be significantly higher towards these clusters if m_nu > 0.3 eV and nearly
isotropic otherwise.

rotational behavior separately for both hemispheres. We obtain that about 60%
of the monthly N-S asymmetries are significant at a 95% level, whereas the
relative contributions of the northern and southern hemisphere are different
for different cycles. From the analysis of power spectra and autocorrelation

southern hemisphere reveals a dominant period of about 28 days, whereas the
autocorrelation is strongly attenuated after 3 periods. These findings suggest
that the activity of the northern hemisphere is dominated by an active zone,
whereas the southern activity is mainly dominated by individual long-lived

realistic lens models a non-zero shear is expected to be induced by the lensing

complex behavior of $<n>$ as a function of $\gamma$ and the normalized surface
mass density in stars $\kappa_*$. Specifically, we find that at high
magnifications, where the average total magnification of the macro-image is
$<\mu>=|(1-\kappa_*)^2-\gamma^2|^{-1}\gg 1$, $<n>$ becomes correspondingly
large, and is proportional to $<\mu>$. The ratio $<n>/<\mu>$ is largest near
the line $\gamma=1-\kappa_*$ where the magnification $<\mu>$ becomes infinite,

Recent observations suggest that the distribution of species such as deuterium
in the ISM may be far from homogeneous. This raises the question of how long it
takes for inhomogeneities to be erased in the ISM, and how this depends on the
length scale of the inhomogeneities. We added a tracer field to the
three-dimensional, supernova-driven ISM model of Avillez (2000) to study mixing
and dispersal in kiloparsec-scale simulations of the ISM with different
supernova (SN) rates and different inhomogeneity length scales. We find several
surprising results. Classical mixing length theory fails to predict the very
weak dependence of mixing time on length scale that we find on scales of
25--500 pc. Derived diffusion coefficients increase exponentially with time,
rather than remaining constant. The variance of composition declines
exponentially, with a time constant of tens of Myr, so that large differences
fade faster than small ones. The time constant depends on the inverse square
root of the supernova rate. One major reason for these results is that even
with numerical diffusion exceeding physical values, gas does not mix quickly
between hot and cold regions.

the resulting feedback processes. Previous work has considered the case of a
single, concentrated nuclear starburst, and also that of distributed single
supernovae (SNe). Here, we consider ISM structuring by SNe originating in
spatially distributed clusters having a cluster membership spectrum given by
the observed HII region luminosity function. We show that in this case, the
volume of HI cleared per SN is considerably greater than in either of the two
cases considered hitherto.
  We derive a simple relationship between the ``porosity'' of the ISM and the
star formation rate (SFR), and deduce a critical SFR_crit, at which the ISM
porosity is unity. This critical value describes the case in which the SN
mechanical energy output over a timescale t_e is comparable with the ISM
``thermal'' energy contained in random motions; t_e is the duration of SN
mechanical input per superbubble. This condition also defines a critical gas
consumption timescale t_exh, which for a Salpeter IMF and random velocities of
\simeq 10 km s-1 is roughly 10e10 years.
  We draw a link between porosity and the escape of ionising radiation from
galaxies, arguing that high escape fractions are expected if SFR >~ SFR_crit.
The Lyman Break Galaxies, which are presumably subject to infall on a timescale
< t_exh, meet this criterion, as is consistent with the significant leakage of
ionising photons inferred in these systems. We suggest the utility of this
simple parameterisation of escape fraction in terms of SFR for semi-empirical
models of galaxy formation and evolution and for modeling mechanical and
chemical feedback effects.

yield a spectrum in good accord with the observed spectrum of Ultra-High Energy
Cosmic Rays (UHECR), if ~ 5-10% of the magnetars are born with voltages
sufficiently high to accelerate the UHECR. The form the spectrum spectrum takes
depends on the gravitational wave losses during the magnetars' early spindown -
pure electromagnetic spindown yields a flattening of the E^3 J(E) spectrum
below 10^{20} eV, while a moderate GZK ``cutoff'' appears if gravitational wave
losses are strong enough. I outline the physics such that the high energy
particles escape with small energy losses from a magnetar's natal supernova,
including Rayleigh-Taylor ``shredding'' of the supernova envelope, expansion of
a relativistic blast wave into the interstellar medium, acceleration of the UHE
ions through surf-riding in the electromgnetic fields of the wind, and escape
of the UHE ions in the rotational equator with negligible radiation loss. The
abundance of interstellar supershells and unusually large supernova remnants
suggests that most of the initial spindown energy is radiated in khz
gravitational waves for several hours after each supernova, with effective
strains from sources at typical distances ~ 3 x 10^{-21}. Such bursts of

jet on the opposite hemisphere appeared to became active around the end of
2001, when the primary jet was shutting down. We investigated the gas and dust
distributions in the coma, which exhibited strong asymmetries in the
sunward/anti-sunward direction. A comparison of the CN and C2 distributions
from 2001 and 1994 (during times when the viewing geometry was almost
identical) shows a remarkable similarity, indicating that the comet's activity
is essentially repeatable from one apparition to the next. We also measured the
dust reflectivities as a function of wavelength and position in the coma, and,
though the dust was very red overall, we again found variations with respect to
the solar direction. We used the primary jet's appearance on several dates to
determine the orientation of the rotation pole to be alpha = 214^{circ}, delta

formation until more massive halos can collapse. Furthermore, chemical
enrichment from Pop III supernovae produces a second transition at z ~ 15-20,
when the mean metallicity of the universe exceeds a critical threshold and Pop
III star formation gives way to Pop II. We show that observations of high
redshift supernovae with the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) have the
potential to trace the cosmic star formation rate out to z >~ 20, provided that
Pop III supernovae are at least as bright as, and ideally brighter than, type
Ia supernovae. We also propose a mechanism for the formation of a novel
population of extremely low metallicity stars of intermediate mass at very high
redshifts, which we term Pop II.5. In our model shock compression, heating, and
subsequent cooling to high density reduces the fragment mass in primordial gas

discussed. Although many carbon stars and late M-stars have been identified in
Local Group galaxies, a coherent understanding in terms of the chemical
evolution- and star formation history of a galaxy is still largely lacking.
Although a few major new surveys have been carried out over the last three
years, the observational data is still incomplete in many respects: 1) for some
of the larger galaxies only a small fraction in area has been surveyed so far,
2) surveys have been conducted using different techniques, and some of the
older surveys are incomplete in bolometric magnitude, 3) only for some galaxies
is there information about the late M-star population, or it is sometimes
unpublished even when the data is available, 4) not all galaxies in the Local
Group have been surveyed, 5) especially for some of the older work insufficient
data is available to determine bolometric magnitudes. I have correlated carbon
star positions with the 2MASS 2nd incremental data release to obtain $JHK$, and
bolometric magnitudes, to remedy this situation in some cases.
  From the existing observations one can derive the following: the formation of
carbon stars is both a function of metallicity and star-formation history. In
galaxies with a similar star formation history, there will be relatively more
carbon stars formed in the system with the lower metallicity. On the other
hand, the scarcity of AGB type carbon stars in some galaxies with the lowest
metallicity indicates that these systems have had a low, if any, star-formation
over the last few Gyrs.

smaller than the average that depend on mu. Computations of the force-force

friction and decay rapidly beyond approximately three particle diameters.

both a single chain and many chains forming a bundle. A theory is developed to
account for the interplay between competitive binding of counterions and charge
correlations in softening the polyelectrolyte (PE) chains. The presence of even
a small concentration of multivalent counterions leads to a dramatic reduction
in the bending rigidity of the chains that are nominally stiffened by the
repulsion between their backbone charges. The variation of the bending rigidity
as a function of $f_{0}$, the fraction of charged monomers on the chain, does
not exhibits simple scaling behavior; it grows with increasing $f_{0}$ below a
critical value of $f_{0}$. Beyond the critical value, however, the chain
becomes softer as $f_{0}$ increases. The bending rigidity also exhibits
intriguing dependence on the concentration of multivalent counterion $n_{2}$;
for highly charged PEs, the bending rigidity decreases as $n_2$ increases from
zero, while it increases with increasing $n_{2}$ beyond a certain value of
$n_{2}$. When polyelectrolyte chains form a $N$-loop condensate (e.g., a
toroidal bundle formed by $N$ turns (winds) of the chain), the inter-loop
coupling further softens the condensate, resulting in the bending free energy
of the condensate that scales as $N$ for large $N$.

to the conserved local charges of the system. We show that the system has two
infinite sets of such conserved charges following from the Lax equation, much
like dispersionless systems. We show that the system has two Hamiltonian
structures which are compatible so that it is truly a bi-Hamiltonian system.
However, the two Hamiltonian structures act on the two distinct sets of charges
to give the dynamical equations, which is quite distinct from the behavior in
conventional integrable systems. We construct two recursion operators which
connect the conserved charges within a given set as well as between the two
sets. We show explicitly that the conserved charges are in involution with
respect to either of the Hamiltonian structures thereby proving complete
integrability of the system. Various other interesting features are also
discussed.

  and Quantum Energy Variation",,,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  By taking both the Doppler frequency shift for electromagnetic wave and the
quantum energy variation of matter wave into consideration, a
resonant-absorption condition based on the local-ether wave equation is
presented to account for a variety of phenomena consistently, including the
Ives-Stilwell experiment, the output frequency from ammonia masers, and the
M\""{o}ssbauer rotor experiment. It is found that in the resonant-absorption
condition, the major term associated with the laboratory velocity is a
dot-product term between this velocity and that of the emitting or absorbing
atom. This term appears both in the Doppler frequency shift and the transition
frequency variation and then cancels out. Thereby, the experimental results can
be independent of the laboratory velocity and hence comply with Galilean
relativity, despite the restriction that the involved velocities are referred
specifically to the local-ether frame. However, by examining the
resonant-absorption condition in the M\""{o}ssbauer rotor experiment to a higher
order, it is found that Galilean relativity breaks down.

  Local-Ether Wave Equation",,,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Based on the local-ether wave equation for free particle, the dispersion of
matter wave is examined. From the dispersion relation, the angular frequency
and wavelength of matter wave are derived. These formulas look like the
postulates of de Broglie in conjunction with the Lorentz mass-variation law.
However, the fundamental difference is that for terrestrial particles their
speeds are referred specifically to a geocentric inertial frame and hence
incorporate the speed due to earth's rotation. Thus the local-ether model
predicts an east-west directional anisotropy both in mass and wavelength.
Meanwhile, in spite of the restriction on reference frame, the local-ether
model can account for the matter-wave interference experiments of the Bragg
reflection and the Sagnac effect. For electron wave, the effects of earth's
rotation are negligible and the derived Bragg angle is actually in accord with
the Davisson-Germer experiment, as examined within the present precision. On
the other hand, the local-ether model leads to a directional anisotropy in the
Bragg angle in neutron diffraction. The predicted anisotropy due to earth's
rotation then provide a means to test the local-ether wave equation.

accelerated initially to a centre of mass of 500 GeV and later to 1 TeV or
more. In the process of accelerating 192 bunches within a pulse train,
wakefields are excited which kick the trailing bunches off axis and can cause
luminosity dilution and BBU (Beam Break Up). Several structures to damp the
wakefield have been designed and tested at SLAC and KEK and these have been
found to successfully damp the wakefield [1]. However, these 2pi/3 structures
suffered from electrical breakdown and this has prompted us to explore lower
group velocity structures operating at higher fundamental mode phase advances.
The wakefield partitioning amongst the bands has been found to change markedly
with increased phase advance. Here we report on general trends in the kick
factor and associated wakefield band partitioning in dipole bands as a function
of phase advance of the synchronous mode in linacs. These results are
applicable to both TW (travelling wave) and SW (standing wave) structures [1]
