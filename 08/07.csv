magnetosphere in the production of the observed radio emission. It is argued
that observations of pulsar profiles suggest that a feedback mechanism exists
between the star surface and the null charge surface, requiring particle flow
in both directions. In their flow to and from the surface the particles execute
an azimuthal drift around the magnetic pole, thereby creating a ring of
discrete `emission nodes' close to the surface. Motion of the nodes is observed
as the well-known subpulse `drift', but is interpreted here as a small residual
component of the real particle drift. The nodes can therefore move in either
direction, or even remain stationary. A precise fit is found for the pulsar
PSR0943+10. Azimuthal interactions between different regions of the
magnetosphere depend on the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes and
influence the conal type, as observed. The requirement of intermittent weak
pair-production in an outergap suggests a natural evolutionary link between
radio and gamma-ray pulsars.

spectroscopic observations of Halpha+[NII] along 3 parallel slit positions. The
observed mean velocities are consistent with a rotating thin disk. We model the
gas disk in the customary way. This sets a 3 sigma upper limit of 10^8 Msun on
black hole mass, Mbh. The velocity dispersion at r <0.5'' is in excess of that
predicted by the thin rotating disk model. This does not invalidate the model,
if the excess dispersion is caused by localized turbulent motion in addition to
bulk circular rotation. However, if instead the dispersion is caused by the BH
potential then a mass Mbh ~ 6x10^8 Msun is inferred by modeling the central gas
dispersion as due to an isotropic spherical distribution of collisionless gas
cloudlets. The stellar kinematics for NGC 4335 are derived from a ground-based
(WHT/ISIS) long-slit observation along the galaxy major axis. A two-integral
model of the stellar dynamics yields Mbh >= 3x10^9 Msun. However, there is
reason to believe that this model overestimates Mbh. Reported correlations
between black hole mass and inner stellar velocity dispersion sigma predict Mbh
to be >= 5.4x10^8 Msun in NGC 4335. If our standard thin disk modeling of the
gas kinematics is valid, then NGC 4335 has an unusually low Mbh for its
velocity dispersion. If, on the other hand, this approach is flawed, and
provides an underestimate of Mbh, then black hole masses for other galaxies
derived from HST gas kinematics with the same assumptions should be treated
with caution.

basic equations governing the wavefronts, lightcones, caustics on wavefronts,
and caustic surfaces on lightcones in the context of weak-field, thin-screen
gravitational lensing. These equations are all related to the potential of the
lens. In the process, we also show that the standard single-plane gravitational
lensing map extends to a new mapping, which we call a wavefront lensing map.
Unlike the standard lensing map, the Jacobian matrix of a wavefront lensing map
is not symmetric. Our formulas are then applied to caustic ``surfing.'' By
surfing a caustic surface, a space-borne telescope can be fixed on a
gravitationally lensed source to obtain an observation of the source at very
high magnification over an extended time period, revealing structure about the
source that could not otherwise be resolved. Using our analytical expressions
for caustic sheets, we present a scheme for surfing a caustic sheet of a lensed
source in rectilinear motion. Detailed illustrations are also presented of the
possible types of wavefronts and caustic sheets due to nonsingular and singular
elliptical potentials, and singular isothermal spheres, including an example of
caustic surfing for a singular elliptical potential lens.

is that the spectropolarimetric signatures for the Ae stars differ from those
of the Herbig Be stars, with characteristics changing from depolarisation
across Halpha in the Herbig Be stars, to line polarisations in the Ae group.
The frequency of depolarisations detected in the Herbig Be stars (7/12) is
particularly interesting as, by analogy to classical Be stars, it may be the
best evidence to date that the higher mass Herbig stars are surrounded by
flattened structures. For the Herbig Ae stars, 9 out of 11 show a line
polarisation effect that can be understood in terms of a compact Halpha
emission that is itself polarised by a rotating disc-like circumstellar medium.
The spectropolarimetric difference between the Herbig Be and Ae stars may be
the first indication that there is a transition in the Hertzsprung-Russell
Diagram from magnetic accretion at spectral type A to disc accretion at

Kaiser & Peacock (1994). An optimal weight factor, which minimizes the errors

redshift-space distortions are incorporated. Using this formula, we assess the
feasibility of the power spectrum analysis with the luminous red galaxy (LRG)
sample in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as a probe of the equation of state of
the dark energy. Fisher matrix analysis shows that the LRG sample can be
sensitive to the equation of state around redshift z=0.13. It is also
demonstrated that the LRG sample can constrain the equation of state with
(1-sigma) error of 10% level, if other fundamental cosmological parameters are
well determined independently. For the useful constraint, we point out the
importance of modeling the bias taking the luminosity dependence into account.
We also discuss the optimized strategy to constrain the equation of state using
power spectrum analysis. For a sample with fixed total number of objects, it is
most advantageous to have the sample with the mean number density $10^{-4}

O VI absorption along paths through the Milky Way thick disk/halo. Strong O VI
absorption over the approximate velocity range from -100 to 100 km/s reveals a
widespread but highly irregular distribution of thick disk O VI, implying the
existence of substantial amounts of hot gas with T ~ 3x10^5 K in the Milky Way
halo. Large irregularities in the distribution of the absorbing gas are found
to be similar over angular scales extending from less than one to 180 degrees,
indicating a considerable amount of small and large scale structure in the gas.
The overall distribution of Galactic O VI is not well described by a
symmetrical plane-parallel layer of patchy O VI absorption. The simplest
departure from such a model that provides a reasonable fit to the observations
is a plane-parallel patchy absorbing layer with a scale height of 2.3 kpc, and
a 0.25 dex excess of O VI in the northern Galactic polar region. The O VI
absorption has a Doppler parameter b = 30 to 99 km/s, with an average value of
60 km/s . Thermal broadening alone cannot explain the large observed profile
widths. The average O VI absorption velocities toward high latitude objects
range from -46 to 82 km/s, with a sample average of 0 km/s and a standard
deviation of 21 km/s. O VI associated with the thick disk moves both toward and
away from the plane with roughly equal frequency. A combination of models
involving the radiative cooling of hot fountain gas, the cooling of supernova
bubbles in the halo, and the turbulent mixing of warm and hot halo gases is
required to explain the presence of O VI and other highly ionized atoms found

find that it is critical to correct for PSF effects when evaluating the surface

exponential profile. After correcting for PSF effects, we find that at higher

the rarity (about 15 percent) of the transition phase in novae. Recent
observations of three novae seem to support our prediction. The connection is
explained as follows: The nova outburst disrupts the accretion disc only in
IPs. The recovery of the disc, a few weeks-months after the eruption, causes
strong winds that block the radiation from the white dwarf, thus dust is not
destroyed. If the winds are very strong as is probably the case in DQ Her
(perhaps since its spin period is very short) this leads to a dust minimum.

this galaxy system. The 3D galaxy distribution has been inferred from quality
distance estimates obtained by averaging distance moduli based upon the TF
relationship taken from eight published datasets previously homogenized.
Previous findings that the spiral distribution is substantially more elongated
along the line-of-sight than in the plane of the sky are confirmed by the
current data. In addition, an important east-west disparity in this effect has
been detected. The overall width-to-depth ratio of the Virgo cluster region is
about 1:4, with the most distant objects concentrated in the western half. The
filamentary structure of the spiral population and its orientation are also
reflected by the HI-deficient objects alone. The HI deficiency pattern shows a
central enhancement arising from galaxies that belong to the Virgo cluster
proper. However, significant gas deficiencies are also detected outside the
main body of the cluster in a probable group of galaxies at line-of-sight
distances 25-30 Mpc, as well as in various foreground galaxies. In the Virgo
region, the HI content of the galaxies then is not a straightforward indicator

cluster age. Cluster-to-cluster variations in the stellar initial mass function
(IMF) have been suggested as an explanation. We discuss the implications of the
observed degree of mass segregation in our sample clusters for the shape of the
initial mass function.
  Our results are based on Hubble Space Telescope/WFPC2 observations of six
rich star clusters in the LMC, selected to include three pairs of clusters of
similar age, metallicity, and distance from the LMC centre, and exhibiting a
large spread in core radii between the clusters in each pair.
  All clusters show clear evidence of mass segregation: (i) their luminosity
function slopes steepen with increasing cluster radius, and (ii) the brighter
stars are characterized by smaller core radii. For all sample clusters, both
the slope of the luminosity function in the cluster centres and the degree of
mass segregation are similar to each other, within observational errors of a
few tenths of power-law slope fits to the data. This implies that their INITIAL
mass functions must have been very similar, down to ~0.8 - 1.0 M(sun).
  We therefore rule out variations in the IMF of the individual sample clusters
as the main driver of the increasing spread of cluster core radii with cluster
age.

of the supranova model, where initially a supernova explosion takes place,
leaving behind a supra-massive neutron star (SMNS), which eventually loses its
rotational energy and collapses to a black hole, triggering a GRB explosion.
The most natural mechanism by which the SMNS can lose its rotational energy is
through a strong pulsar type wind, between the supernova and the GRB events,
which is expected to create a PWB. We analyze in some detail the observational
implications of such a plerionic environment on the afterglow (AG) and prompt
GRB emissions, and the prospect for direct detection of the plerion emission.
We find that for a simple spherical model, GRBs with iron lines detected in the
X-ray AG should not have a detectable radio afterglow, and should have small
jet break times and non-relativistic transition times, in disagreement with
observations for some of the GRBs with X-ray lines. These discrepancies with
the observations may be reconciled by resorting to a non-spherical geometry,
where the PWB is elongated along the polar axis. We find that lack of detection
of the plerion emission provides interesting constraints on the model
parameters. Finally, we predict that the inverse Compton upscattering of the
PWB photons by the relativistic electrons of the AG (external Compton, EC)
should lead to high energy emission during the early AG that might explain the
GeV photons detected by EGRET for a few GRBs, and should be detectable by
future missions such as GLAST.

A possible origin for separating these liquid states is a remnant vortex
melting line at the original position, which is obscured and suppressed by the
quantum fluctuations. A non-linear behavior of the in-plane resistivity appears
at large current density in only the low resistance state, but not in another
vortex liquid state at higher temperature, where the thermal fluctuations are

temperatures above the order-disorder temperature and in the weak segregation
regime, a linear response theory is presented which gives the polymer density
in the vicinity of confining flat surfaces. The surfaces are chemically
patterned where different regions attract different parts of the copolymer
chain. The surface pattern or template is decomposed into its Fourier modes,
and the decay of these modes is analyzed. The persistence of the surface
pattern into the disordered bulk is given for several types of patterns (e.g.
uniform and striped surface). It further is shown that complex morphology can
be induced in a thin film even though the bulk is disordered. We next consider
lamellar diblock copolymers (low temperature regime) in the presence of a
striped surface. It is shown that lamellae will appear tilted with respect to
the surface, if the surface periodicity is larger than the bulk one. The
lamellae close to the surface are strongly distorted from their perfect shape.
When the surface and lamellar periodicities are equal lamellae form
perpendicular to the surface. Lastly, the transition from parallel to
perpendicular lamellae to the surfaces in a thin film is presented. The
transition between the two states depends on the surface separation and
strength of surface interactions. We further calculate the phase diagram in the
presence of perpendicular electric field favoring perpendicular ordering. In
the strong segregation limit we introduce a simple model to calculate the phase
diagram of the fully parallel, fully perpendicular and mixed (parallel and
perpendicular) states.

materials (no free charges), a dielectric breakdown is expected to occur for
large enough electric fields, preempting any structural phase transition. On
the other hand, dissociated ions can induce a phase transition for fields of
about 10 V/$\mu$m or even lower. This transition is from an insulator state,
where charges are preferentially localized inside bcc spherical domains, to a
conducting state where charges can move along the long axis of oriented
cylinders (forming a hexagonal phase). The cylinders diameter is small and is
determined by the volume fraction of the minority copolymer component. The
strength of this mechanism can be tuned by controlling the amount of free ions
present as is observed by our experiments. These theoretical predictions
support recent experimental findings on the bcc to hexagonal phase transition

control size and location of NCs. For low concentrations of implanted Si, NCs
form via nucleation, growth and Ostwald ripening, whereas for high
concentrations Si separates by spinodal decomposition. In both regimes, NCs
form above a thin NC free oxide layer at the SiO2/Si interface. This,
self-adjusted layer has just a thickness appropriate for NC charging by direct
electron tunneling. Only in the nucleation regime the width of the tunneling
oxide and the mean NC diameter remain constant during a long annealing period.

compiler generator instead of a specialiser, has been used with considerable
success in partial evaluation of both functional and imperative languages. This
paper demonstrates that the cogen approach is also applicable to the
specialisation of logic programs (also called partial deduction) and leads to
effective specialisers. Moreover, using good binding-time annotations, the
speed-ups of the specialised programs are comparable to the speed-ups obtained
with online specialisers. The paper first develops a generic approach to
offline partial deduction and then a specific offline partial deduction method,
leading to the offline system LIX for pure logic programs. While this is a
usable specialiser by itself, it is used to develop the cogen system LOGEN.
Given a program, a specification of what inputs will be static, and an
annotation specifying which calls should be unfolded, LOGEN generates a
specialised specialiser for the program at hand. Running this specialiser with
particular values for the static inputs results in the specialised program.
While this requires two steps instead of one, the efficiency of the
specialisation process is improved in situations where the same program is
specialised multiple times. The paper also presents and evaluates an automatic
binding-time analysis that is able to derive the annotations. While the derived
annotations are still suboptimal compared to hand-crafted ones, they enable
non-expert users to use the LOGEN system in a fully automated way. Finally,
LOGEN is extended so as to directly support a large part of Prolog's
declarative and non-declarative features and so as to be able to perform so
called mixline specialisations.

moving mirror in 1+1 dimensions. When the mirror travels under uniform
acceleration, one encounters severe problems which are due to the infinite blue
shift effects associated with the horizons. On one hand, the Bogoliubov
coefficients are ill-defined and the total energy emitted diverges. On the
other hand, the instantaneous mean flux vanishes. To obtained well-defined
expressions we introduce an alternative model based on an action principle. The
usefulness of this model is to allow to switch on and off the interaction at
asymptotically large times. By an appropriate choice of the switching function,
we obtain analytical expressions for the scattering amplitudes and the fluxes
emitted by the mirror. When the coupling is constant, we recover the vanishing
flux. However it is now followed by transients which inevitably become singular
when the switching off is performed at late time. Our analysis reveals that the
scattering amplitudes (and the Bogoliubov coefficients) should be seen as
distributions and not as mere functions. Moreover, our regularized amplitudes
can be put in a one to one correspondence with the transition amplitudes of an
accelerated detector, thereby unifying the physics of uniformly accelerated
systems. In a forthcoming article, we shall use our scattering amplitudes to
analyze the quantum correlations amongst emitted particles which are also

The horizon can be constructed for the `relativistic' ripplons (surface waves)
living on the brane. The brane is represented by the interface between two
superfluid liquids, 3He-A and 3He-B, sliding along each other without friction.
Similar experimental arrangement has been recently used for the observation and
investigation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz type of instability in superfluids
(cond-mat/0111343). The shear-flow instability in superfluids is characterized
by two critical velocities. The lowest threshold measured in recent experiments
(cond-mat/0111343) corresponds to appearance of the ergoregion for ripplons. In
the modified geometry this will give rise to the black-hole event horizon in
the effective metric experienced by ripplons. In the region behind the horizon,
the brane vacuum is unstable due to interaction with the higher-dimensional
world of bulk superfluids. The time of the development of instability can be
made very long at low temperature. This will allow us to reach and investigate
the second critical velocity -- the proper Kelvin-Helmholtz instability

expected. Using somewhat stronger conditions, we derive explicit bounds on the

three-dimensional zero angular momentum. A change of variables which allows us
to go from the one-dimensional case to that of two dimensions results in a
bound for the zero angular momentum case. Finally, we obtain a bound on the
total number of bound states in two dimensions, first for the radial case and

used to understand the pattern wavenumber. Our results suggest that the mean
flow, generated by amplitude gradients, plays an important role in the roll
compression observed as the control parameter is increased. Near threshold the
mean flow has a quadrupole dependence with a single vortex in each quadrant
while away from threshold the mean flow exhibits an octupole dependence with a
counter-rotating pair of vortices in each quadrant. This is confirmed
analytically using the amplitude equation and Cross-Newell mean flow equation.
By performing numerical experiments the large scale counterflow is also found
to aid in the roll compression away from threshold but to a much lesser degree.
Our results yield an understanding of the pattern wavenumbers observed in
experiment away from threshold and suggest that near threshold the mean flow
and large scale counterflow are not responsible for the observed shift to
smaller than critical wavenumbers.

more similar to that in the experimental device. Solutions are calculated

  improved","J.Math.Phys. 44 (2003) 5902-5936","10.1063/1.1623333",,"quant-ph hep-th",,"  In this paper we study the Hilbert space structure underlying the Koopman-von
Neumann (KvN) operatorial formulation of classical mechanics. KvN limited
themselves to study the Hilbert space of zero-forms that are the square
integrable functions on phase space. They proved that in this Hilbert space the
evolution is unitary for every system. In this paper we extend the KvN Hilbert
space to higher forms which are basically functions of the phase space points
and the differentials on phase space. We prove that if we equip this space with
a positive definite scalar product the evolution can turn out to be non-unitary
for some systems. Vice versa if we insist in having a unitary evolution for
every system then the scalar product cannot be positive definite. Identifying
the one-forms with the Jacobi fields we provide a physical explanation of these
phenomena. We also prove that the unitary/non unitary character of the
evolution is invariant under canonical transformations.

mechanics. In the first one the Jacobi fields are represented by bosonic
variables and belong to the vector (or its dual) representation of the
symplectic group. In the second formulation the Jacobi fields are given as
condensates of Grassmannian variables belonging to the spinor representation of
the metaplectic group. For both formulations we shall show that, differently
from what happens in the case presented in paper no. (I), it is possible to
endow the associated Hilbert space with a positive definite scalar product and
to describe the dynamics via a Hermitian Hamiltonian. The drawback of this
formulation is that higher forms do not appear automatically and that the
description of chaotic systems may need a further extension of the Hilbert
space.

contradicts Einstein's relativity. Here we announce an unusual TOE called
'nature theory' in which impossible things become possible. We present the
scheme of an apparatus for sending signals over arbitrarily large distances
with speeds arbitrarily exceeding the light speed in vacuum. Introducing the
notions of effective speed and reliability of superluminal devices, we
encourage experimenters to set and break world records in this new branch. At
the same time we outline a mechanism (termed 'particle encapsulation') owing to
which nature theory remains Lorentz invariant and so consistent with
experiments. From among other numerous applications of nature theory we discuss
briefly local antigravitation and new computing machines, called 'vacuum
computers', applying 'cat principle'. They are of great interest because should
enable humans to overcome the Goedel-Turing barrier.

argues that linearity of quantum mechanics follows from lack of superluminal

quantum mechanics.
