1 broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. Our measurements show that [SiVI] 1.963mu,
[SIX] 1.252mu and [SVIII] 0.991mu are present in most of the objects and are
useful tracers of nuclear activity. Line ratios between coronal and low
ionization forbidden lines are larger in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. A
positive correlation between FHWM and ionization potential of the forbidden
lines is observed. Some coronal lines have widths similar to that of lines
emitted in the broad line region (BLR), indicating that part of their flux
originates in gas close to the outer portions of the BLR. Most coronal lines
are blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy and this shift
increases with the increase in line width. Assymetries towards the blue are
observed in the profiles of high-ionization Fe lines, suggesting that the
emitting gas is related to winds or outflows, most probably originating in
material that is being evaporated from the torus. This scenario is supported by
models that combine the effects of shock ionization and photoionization by a
central continuum source in the gas clouds. The agreement between the coronal
line emission predicted by the models and the observations is satisfactory; the
models reproduced the whole range of coronal line intensities observed. We also
report the detection of [FeXIII] 1.074,1.079mu in three of our objects and the
first detection of [PII] 1.188mu and [NiII] 1.191mu in a Seyfert 1 galaxy, ARK
564. Using the ratio [PII]/[FeII] we deduced that most Fe present in the outer
NLR of ARK 564 is locked up in grains, and the influence of shocks is
negligible.

of the optical continuum and broad H-beta emission line in the Seyfert 1 galaxy

1248 H-beta measurements. The H-beta variations follow the continuum variations
closely, with a typical time delay of about 20 days. However, a year-by-year
analysis shows that the magnitude of emission-line time delay is correlated
with the mean continuum flux. We argue that the data are consistent with the
simple model prediction that the size of the broad-line region is proportional
to the square root of the ionizing luminosity. Moreover, the apparently linear
nature of the correlation between the H-beta response time and the nonstellar
optical continuum arises as a consequence of the changing shape of the
continuum as it varies, specifically with the optical (5100 A) continuum
luminosity proportional to the ultraviolet (1350 A) continuum luminosity to the
0.56 power.

arcsecond and milli-arcsecond jets, PKS 1510-089 is perhaps the most highly
misaligned radio jet ever observed and serves as a graphic example of
projection effects in a highly beamed relativistic jet. Here we present the
results of observations designed to bridge the gap between the milli-arcsecond
and arcsecond scales. We find that a previously detected ``counter-feature'' to
the arcsecond jet is directly fed by the milli-arcsecond jet. This feature is
located 0.3"" from the core, corresponding to a de-projected distance of 30
kiloparsecs. The feature appears to be dominated by shocked emission and has an
almost perfectly ordered magnetic field along its outside edge. We conclude
that it is most likely a shocked bend, viewed end-on, where the jet crosses our
line of sight to form the southern arcsecond jet. While the bend appears to be
nearly 180 degrees when viewed in projection, we estimate the intrinsic bending
angle to be between 12 and 24 degrees. The cause of the bend is uncertain;
however, we favor a scenario where the jet is bent after it departs the galaxy,
either by ram pressure due to winds in the intracluster medium or simply by the
density gradient in the transition to the intergalactic medium.

broken supersymmetric theory can threat the stability of the standard vacuum.
The generic situation is twofold. Directions in scalar field space may exist
along which the potential becomes unbounded from below or local minima deeper
than the standard one are likely to appear where charge and/or color symmetries
are broken. An investigation of these matters requires a thorough study of the
tree level effective potential as well as its radiative corrections. However,
the presence of many different mass scales in such a generic supersymmetric
theory needs an appropriate renormalization improved treatment. Combining the
decoupling theorem with a conveniently chosen renormalization scale for each
field configuration, the well known multimass scale problem is circumvented. In
this context, the ordinary universal soft-parameters case of the minimal
supersymmetric model as well as a non-universal case of a brane world minimal
supergravity model are examined closely for unphysical vacuua.

transverse energy E_t of J/Psi and Psi' produced in Pb-Pb collisions at the
CERN-SPS are analyzed and it is claimed that they contain information about the
time structure of anomalous suppression. A transport equation which describes
transverse motion of J/Psi and Psi' in the absorptive medium is proposed and
solved for a QGP and a comover scenario of suppression. While the comover
approach accounts for the data fairly well without adjusting any parameter, the
fit to the data within the QGP scenario requires to assume anomalous
suppression to become effective rather late, 3-4 fm/c after the nuclear
overlap.

case when it shifts the atomic internal ground and excited state in the same
way, which is particularly useful for quantum information applications of
cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems. Long trapping times can be
achieved, as shown by full 3-D simulations of the quasi-classical motion inside
the resonator.

accelerated by an external potential realized as a space-dependent mass term in
quantum electrodynamics. In particular, we calculate the position shift of the
final-state wave packet of the charged particle due to radiation at lowest
order in the fine structure constant alpha and in the small h-bar
approximation. We show that it disagrees with the result obtained using the
Lorentz-Dirac formula for the radiation-reaction force, and that it agrees with
the classical theory if one assumes that the particle loses its energy to
radiation at each moment of time according to the Larmor formula in the static
frame of the potential. However, the discrepancy is much smaller than the
Compton wavelength of the particle. We also point out that the electromagnetic
correction to the potential has no classical limit. (Correction. Surface terms
were erroneously discarded to arrive at Eq. (59). By correcting this error we
find that the position shift according to the Lorentz-Dirac theory obtained
from Eq. (12) is reproduced by quantum field theory in the hbar -> 0 limit. We
also find that the small V(z) approximation is unnecessary for this agreement.

the wave-function. Although the physical entities are recognized by the
existence of invariant quantities, examples from classical and quantum physics
suggest that not all the theoretical terms refer to the entities: some terms
refer to properties of the entities, and some terms have only an epistemic
function. In particular, it is argued that the wave-function may be written in
terms of classical non-referring and epistemic terms. The implications for
realist interpretations of quantum mechanics and on the teaching of quantum
physics are examined.
