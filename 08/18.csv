a phase diagram in the angular velocity (Omega) - baryon number (N) plane is
investigated. The dividing line N_crit(Omega) between configurations with one
and two phases is correlated to a local maximum of the moment of inertia and
can thus be subject to experimental verification by observation of the
rotational behavior of accreting compact stars. Another characteristic line,
which also can be measured is the transition line to black holes that of the
maximum mass configurations. The positions and the shape of these lines are
sensitive to changes in the equation of state (EoS) of stellar matter. A
comparison of the regional structure of phase diagrams is performed for
polytropic and relativistic mean field type EoS and correlations between the
topology of the transition lines and the properties of two-phase EoS are
obtained. Different scenarios of compact star evolution are discussed as
trajectories in the phase diagram. It is shown that a population gap in the
Omega - N plane for accreting compact stars would signal a high density phase
transition and could be observed in the distribution of so called Z sources of
quasi periodic oscillations in low-mass X-ray binaries.

"astro-ph/0208333","Stanley L. Robertson","Stanley L. Robertson and Darryl J. Leiter","How Black Are Black Hole Candidates?","17 pages, submitted to Astrophysical Journal",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In previous work we found that many of the spectral properties of x-ray
binaries, including both galactic black hole candiates (GBHC) and neutron
stars, were consistent with the existence of intrinsically magnetized central
objects. Here we review and extend the observational evidence for the existence
of intrinsically magnetized GBHC and show that their existence is consistent
with a new class of solutions of the Einstein field equations of General
Relativity. These solutions are based on a strict adherence to the Principle of
Equivalence, which prevents the time-like geodesics of physical matter from
becoming null on trapped surfaces of infinite red shift. The new solutions
emerge from the fact that the structure and radiation transfer properties of
the energy-momentum tensor on the right hand side of the Einstein field
equations must have a form that is consistent with this Principle of
Equivalence requirement. In this context, we show that the Einstein field
equations allow the existence of highly red shifted, magnetospheric, eternally
collapsing objects (MECO) which do not have trapped surfaces which lead to
event horizons. Since MECO lifetimes are many orders of magnitude greater than
a Hubble time, they provide an elegant and unified framework for understanding
the broad range of observations associated with GBHC and active galactic
nuclei.
