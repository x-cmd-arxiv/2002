and XMM-Newton satellites (respectively) have opened up an interesting, new
observational possibility in the field of Herbig-Haro objects. In order to be
able to plan further X-ray observations of other HH objects, it is now of
interest to be able to estimate their X-ray luminosities in order to choose
which objects to observe. This paper describes a simple, analytic model for
predicting the X-ray luminosity of a bow shock from the parameters of the flow
(i.e., the size of the bow shock, its velocity, and the pre-shock density). The
accuracy of the analytic model is analyzed through a comparison with the
predictions obtained from axisymmetric, gasdynamic simulations of the leading
working surface of an HH jet. We find that our analytic model reproduces the
observed X-ray luminosities of HH 2 and HH 154, and we propose that HH~80/81 is
a good candidate for future observations with Chandra.

galaxies at z ~ 6, which is now suggested as the epoch when the reionization
era of the Universe ends. To plan such surveys, we need a reasonable
expectation of the surface density of high redshift galaxies at different flux
limits. Here we present a simple prediction of the surface density of 5.5 < z <
6.5 galaxies in the optical regime, extrapolating from what is already known
about galaxies at z ~ 3. This prediction is consistent with the results of
nearly all known searches for objects at z ~ 6, giving confidence that we may
use it to plan optimal combination of survey depth and sky coverage in
searching for such objects. We suggest that the most efficient strategy with
existing ground-based facilities is to do medium-depth (m_{AB}= 24.0 -- 24.5
mag), wide-field (a couple of square degrees) survey using a wide-field camera
at a 4m-class telescope. As the predicted surface density at this brightness
level is very sensitive to the value of L*, the result of such a survey can be
easily used to constrain the luminosity evolution from z ~ 3 to 6.

X-rays, the situation for XRB jets is not so clear. Radio jets have been
resolved in several XRBs in the low/hard state, and it seems likely that some
form of outflow is present whenever this state is achieved. Interestingly, the
flat-to-inverted radio synchrotron emission associated with these outflows
strongly correlates with the X-ray emission in several sources, suggesting that
the jet plasma plays a role at higher frequencies. In this same state, there is
also increasing evidence for a turnover in the IR/optical where the
flat-to-inverted spectrum seems to connect to an optically thin component
extending into the X-rays. We discuss how jet synchrotron emission is likely to
contribute to the X-rays, in addition to inverse Compton up-scattering,
providing a natural explanation for these correlations and the turnover in the

physiological studies. STDP depends on the precise temporal relationship of
pre- and post-synaptic spikes. Many authors have indicated that a precise
balance between long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of
STDP is significant for a stable learning. However, a situation in which the
balance is maintained precisely is inconceivable in the brain. Using a method
of the statistical neurodynamics, we show robust retrieval properties of
spatio-temporal patterns in an associative memory model against the imbalance
between LTP and LTD. When the fluctuation of LTD is assumed to obey a Gaussian
distribution with mean 0 and variance $\delta^2$, the storage capacity takes a
finite value even at large $\delta$. This means that the balance between LTP
and LTD of STDP need not to be maintained precisely, but must be maintained on
average. Furthermore, we found that a basin of attraction becomes smaller as
$\delta$ increases while an initial critical overlap remains unchanged.

from sigma_{+/-} that corresponds to the tightly tethered dipolar dimer model,
to R_c --> infinity, that corresponds to the Stillinger-Lovett description of
the free ion system. The coexistence curve and critical point parameters are
obtained as a function of R_c by grand canonical Monte Carlo techniques. Our
results show that this dependence is smooth but non-monotonic and converges
asymptotically towards the free ion case for relatively small values of R_c.
This fact allows us to describe the gas-liquid transition in the free ion model
as a transition between two dimerized fluid phases. The role of the unpaired

two phases show three states: two being homogeneous states corresponding to
each phase, and a third state which consists of a mix between the two phases
(phase coexistence).
  Although the gas-liquid analogy to traffic models has been widely discussed,
no traffic-related model ever displayed a completely understood stochastic
version of that transition. Having a stochastic model is however important to
understand the potentially probabilistic nature of the transition. Most
importantly, if indeed 2-phase models describe certain aspects correctly, then
this leads to predictions for breakdown probabilities. Alternatively, if
1-phase models describe these aspects better, then there is no
breakdown.Interestingly, such 1-phase models can still allow for jam formation
on small scales, which may give the impression of having a 2-phase dynamics.

direction is known for constant error and randomized communication complexity.
We first study a one-sided version of this bound and obtain that its value lies
between the MA- and AM-complexities of the considered function. Hence the lower
bound actually works for a (communication complexity) class between MA cap
co-MA and AM cap co-AM. We also show that the MA-complexity of the disjointness
problem is Omega(sqrt(n)). Following this we consider the conjecture that the
lower bound method is polynomially tight for randomized communication
complexity. First we disprove a distributional version of this conjecture. Then
we give a combinatorial characterization of the value of the lower bound
method, in which the optimization over all distributions is absent. This
characterization is done by what we call a uniform threshold cover. We also
study relaxations of this notion, namely approximate majority covers and
majority covers, and compare these three notions in power, exhibiting
exponential separations. Each of these covers captures a lower bound method

symmetry, of the brane-world cosmological models. The equations describing the
temporal, radial, and angular dependence of the perturbations are derived by
taking into account the effects of both scalar and tensor parts of the dark
energy term on the brane. The time decay of the initial rotation is
investigated for several types of equation of state of the ultra-high density
cosmological matter. For an expanding Universe, rotation always decays in the
case of the perfect dragging, for which the angular velocity of the matter on
the brane equals the rotation metric tensor. For non-perfect dragging, the
behavior of the rotation is strongly equation of state dependent. For some
classes of dense matter, like the stiff causal or the Chaplygin gas, the
angular velocity of the matter on the brane is an increasing function of time.
For other types of the ultra-dense matter, like the Hagedorn fluid, rotation is
smoothed out by the expansion of the Universe. Therefore the study of dynamics
of rotational perturbations of brane world models, as well as in general
relativity, could provide some insights on the physical properties and equation
of state of the cosmological fluid filling the very early Universe.

  34:1564-1609,2003",,,"hep-th gr-qc",,"  This is a critical review of inert properties of classical relativistic point
objects. The objects are classified as Galilean and non-Galilean. Three types
of non-Galilean objects are considered: spinning, rigid, and dressed particles.
In the absence of external forces, such particles are capable of executing not
only uniform motions along straight lines but also Zitterbewegungs,
self-accelerations, self-decelerations, and uniformly accelerated motions. A
free non-Galilean object possesses the four-velocity and the four-momentum
which are in general not collinear, therefore, its inert properties are
specified by two, rather than one, invariant quantities. It is shown that a
spinning particle need not be a non-Galilean object. The necessity of a rigid
mechanics for the construction of a consistent classical electrodynamics in
spacetimes of dimension D+1 is justified for D+1>4. The problem of how much the
form of fundamental laws of physics orders four dimensions of our world is
revised together with its solution suggested by Ehrenfest. The present analysis
made it apparent that the notion of the ``back-reaction'' does not reflect the
heart of the matter in classical field theories with point-like sources, the
notion of ``dressed'' particles proves more appropriate.

have not only answered the fixed point question for sufficiently large p but
have also rigorously estimated the number of such pairs given certain
conditions on g and h. We attempt to give heuristics for similar estimates
given other conditions on g and h and also in the case of two-cycles. These
heuristics are well-supported by the data we have collected, and seem suitable
for conversion into rigorous estimates in the future.

governed by the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. In this paper the stationary
solutions of this equation have been systematically presented. The phase-plane
method, qualitative analysis, and mechanical interpretation of the differential
equations are widely used. It is well known that TE waves can be guided by the
single interface between two semi-infinite media, providing that one of the
media has a self-focusing (Kerr type) nonlinearity. This special solution is
called a spatial soliton. In this paper our interests are not restricted to the
soliton solutions. In the context of the nonlinear substrate and cladding we
have found solutions which could be useful to describe also the incident light
in nonlinear medium. This result is the main point of the paper. Some of the
presented stationary solutions were already used in similar optical context in
literature but we show a little wider class of solutions. In the last section
we review and illustrate some results concerning the spatial soliton solution.

Multiplier (GEM) detectors. The effects of GEM hole diameter, detector gain,
applied voltages, number of GEMs and other parameters on ion feedback are
investigated in detail. In particular, it was found that the ion feedback is
independent of the gas mixture and the pressure. In the optimized multi-GEM
structure, the ion feedback current can be suppressed down to 0.5% of the anode
current, at a drift field of 0.1 kV/cm and gain of 10^4. A simple model of ion
feedback in multi-GEM structures is suggested. The results obtained are
relevant to the performance of time projection chambers and gas
photomultipliers.

climatic records and their relevance for the evaluation of global climate
models and rare events.The persistence can be characterized, for example, by
the correlation C(s) of temperature variations separated by s days.We show
that, contrary to previous expectations, C(s) decays for large s as a power
law, C(s) ~ s^(-gamma). For continental stations, the exponent gamma is always
close to 0.7, while for stations on islands gamma is around 0.4. In contrast to
the temperature fluctuations, the fluctuations of the rainfall usually cannot
be characterized by long-term power-law correlations but rather by pronounced
short-term correlations. The universal persistence law for the temperature
fluctuations on continental stations represents an ideal (and uncomfortable)
test-bed for the state of-the-art global climate models and allows us to
evaluate their performance. In addition, the presence of long-term correlations
leads to a novel approach for evaluating the statistics of rare events.

Using an information-spectrum method, we discuss what quantum measurement we
should perform in order to attain the optimal exponent of the second error
probability under the condition that the first error probability goes to 0. As
an asymptotically optimal measurement, we propose a projection measurement
characterized by the irreducible representation theory of the special linear
group SL(H). Specially, in spin 1/2 system, it is realized by the simultaneous
measurement of the total momentum and a momentum of a specified direction. As a
byproduct, we obtain another proof of quantum Stein's lemma.

determine the optimal measurement to be carried on the detectors, in order to

involving the detector only, in multibeam experiments, with equally populated

the other two require the introduction of an ancillary quantum system, as part
of the read-out apparatus.
