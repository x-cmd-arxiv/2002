impact excitation of (e+Fe XVII) is carried out using the BPRM method in the
relativistic close coupling approximation. Two sets of eigenfunction expansions
are employed; first, up to the n = 3 complex corresponding 37 fine-structure
levels (37CC) from 21 LS terms; second, up to the n = 4 corresponding to 89
fine-structure levels (89CC) from 49 LS terms. In contrast to previous works,
the 37CC and the 89CC collision strengths exhibit considerable differences.
Denser and broader resonances due to n = 4 are present in the 89CC results both
above and {\it below} the 37 thresholds, thus significantly affecting the
collision strengths for the primary X-ray and EUV transitions within the first
37 n = 3 levels. Extensive study of other effects on the collision strengths is
also reported: (i) electric and magnetic multipole transitions E1, E2, E3 and
M1, M2, (ii) J-partial wave convergence of dipole and non-dipole transitions,
(iii) high energy behaviour compared to other approximations. Theortical
results are benchmarked against experiments to resolve longstanding
discrepancies -- collision strengths for the three prominent X-ray lines 3C, 3D
and 3E at 15.014, 15.265, and 15.456 \AA are in good agreement with two
independent measurements on Electron-Beam-Ion-Traps (EBIT). Finally, line
ratios from a collisional-radiative model using the new collisional rates are
compared with observations from stellar coronae and EBITs to illustrate
potential applications in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.

ground-based optical spectrum. The images confirm the galaxy to be extremely
small, with a maximum extent of only 300 pc, a luminosity ~ 10^-4 L*, and an
estimated mass ~ 10^7 M(sun). Its morphology is highly asymmetric, with a tail
of material on its western side that may be tidal in origin. The U-band image
shows this tail to be part of a stream of material in which stars have recently
formed. Most of the star formation in the galaxy is however concentrated in a
central, compact (d ~ 10 - 15 pc) star cluster. The outer regions of the galaxy
are significantly redder than the cluster, with V - I colors consistent with a
population dominated by K and M stars. While these results rule out earlier
speculation that POX 186 is a protogalaxy, its morphology, mass and active star
formation suggest that it represents a recent (within ~ 10^8 yr) collision
between two clumps of stars of sub-galactic size (~ 100 pc). POX 186 may thus
be a very small dwarf galaxy that, dynamically speaking, is still in the
process of formation. This interpretation is supported by the fact that it
resides in a void, so its morphology cannot be explained as the result of an
encounter with a more massive galaxy. Clumps of stars this small may represent
the building blocks required by hierarchical models of galaxy formation, and
these results also support the recent ""downsizing"" picture of galaxy formation
in which the least massive objects are the last to form.

then there is no possibility of steady rotation, and precession is inevitable.
Even if the magnetic stresses are not strong enough to prevent steady rotation,
we show that the minimum energy state is one in which the star precesses. Since
the moment of inertia tensor is inherently triaxial in a magnetic star, the
precession is periodic but not sinusoidal in time, in agreement with
observations of PSR 1828-11. However, the problem we consider is {\it not} just
precession of a triaxial body. If magnetic stresses dominate, the amplitude of
the precession is not set just by the angle between the rotational angular
velocity and any principal axis, which allows it to be small without
suppressing oscillations of timing residuals at harmonics of the precession
frequency. We argue that magnetic distortions can lead to oscillations of
timing residuals of the amplitude, period, and relative strength of harmonics
observed in PSR 1828-11 if magnetic stresses in its core are about 200 times
larger than the classical Maxwell value for its dipole field, and the stellar
distortion induced by these enhanced magnetic stresses is about 100-1000 times
larger than the deformation of the neutron star's crust. Magnetic stresses this
large can arise if the core is a Type II superconductor, or from toroidal
fields $\sim 10^{14}$ G if the core is a normal conductor. The observations of
PSR 1828-11 appear to require that the neutron star is slightly prolate.

arcseconds, reaching a maximum ellipticity of approximately 0.65 at 60 arcsec
(15 kpc). The surface brightness profile in the spectrally soft, flattened
region is shallower than that of the starlight, indicating that the emission
comes from hot gas rather than stellar sources. The flattening is so extreme
that the gas cannot be in hydrostatic equilibrium in any plausible potential. A
likely alternative is that the gas has significant rotational support. A simple
model, representing isothermal gas distributed about a particular angular
momentum, can reproduce the X-ray morphology while staying consistent with
stellar kinematics. The specific angular momentum of the gas matches that of
the stars in the most isophotally distorted outer part of the galaxy, and its
cooling time matches the time since the last major merger. We infer that the
gas was acquired in that merger, which involved a pre-existing elliptical
galaxy with a hot ISM. The hot gas carried the angular momentum of the

We calculate the strength and radial dependence of torques on disks that arise
from a misalignment between the disk and the main axis system of a flattened
dark matter halo. We find that except for in the very inner regions, the
torques are well-described by a power law of the form $\tau \propto r^{-2.5}$.
The magnitude of the torque is large enough for the entire disk to react to the
torque in less than the Hubble time. We demonstrate analytically that disks
which are originally located in the $xy$-plane and which are subjected to a
torque around the x-axis tilt around the y-axis, as also found in fully
non-linear N-body simulations. We further demonstrate that that the torque
causes the radius of a chosen particle to increase with time. Investigations of
tilting disks which treat the disk as a set of solid rings thus may
systematically overestimate the effects of the torque by a factor of two. For
torques of the form we investigate, the inner regions of the disk react to the
torque faster than the outer regions, resulting in a trailing warp. We then
study the effect of the self-gravity of the disk in such a scenario using
numerical N-body models. Self-gravity flattens out the inner regions of the
disk, but these regions are tilted with respect to their initial plane followed
by a non-flat outer region whose tilt decreases with radius. The ``warp
radius,'' which marks the end of the inner flat disk, grows throughout the disk
at a rate that depends only on the strength of the torque and the local surface
density of the disk.

\~ -7.0 +/- 0.4 mag and an initial mass of 13--22 Msun. The brightnesses of the
nearby stars are sufficient to account for the excess blue light seen from the
ground in pre-explosion observations. Therefore, the SN 1993J progenitor did
not necessarily have a blue companion, although by 2001, fainter blue stars are
seen in close proximity to the supernova. These observations do not strongly
limit the mass of a hypothetical companion. A blue dwarf star with a mass up to
30 Msun could have been orbiting the progenitor without being detected in the

supergiant atmospheres with a range of plausible helium abundances. The models

by lossless compression using general-purpose compression tools such as gzip
and bzip2. A key feature of the method is that compressed images can be
converted to FITS files simply by decompressing with gunzip or bunzip2, and
this is a significant advantage for distributing compressed files. The degree
of quantization is chosen to eliminate low-order bits that over-sample the
noise, contain no information, and are difficult or impossible to compress. The
method is lossy but gives guarantees on the maximum absolute difference, the
expected mean difference, and the expected RMS difference between the
compressed and original images; these guarantees make it suitable for use on
raw images. The method consistently compresses images to roughly 1/5 of their
original size with a quantization such that no value changes by more than 1/2
of a standard deviation in the background. This is a dramatic improvement on
lossless compression. It appears that bzip2 compresses the quantized images to

spectra as a function of inferred accretion rate from both the 1998 outburst
and from the non-outburst 1996 and 1998 data. We can fit all the spectra by a
model in which seed photons from the neutron star surface are Comptonized in a
boundary layer. The Comptonized emission illuminates the accretion disc
surface, producing an ionized, relativistically broadened reflection signature,
while the direct emission from the accretion disc can also be seen. The
evolution of the source can be explained if the main parameter driving the
spectral evolution is the average mass accretion rate, which determines the
truncation radius of the inner accretion disc. At low mass accretion rates, in
the island state, the disc truncates before reaching the neutron star surface
and the inner accretion flow/boundary layer is mostly optically thin. The disc
emission is at too low a temperature to be observed in the RXTE spectra, but
some of the seed photons from the neutron star can be seen directly through the
mostly optically thin boundary layer. At higher mass accretion rates, in the
banana state, the disc moves in and the boundary layer becomes much more
optically thick so its temperature drops. The disc can then be seen directly,
but the seed photons from the neutron star surface cannot as they are buried
beneath the increasingly optically thick boundary layer.

in radio-selected flat-spectrum quasars (FSQ) is presented. In contrast to
recent claims in the literature, we find no evidence that the black-hole masses
of radio-selected FSQ are systematically lower that those of luminous
optically-selected radio-loud quasars. The black-hole masses of the FSQ are
estimated via the virial black-hole mass estimator which utilizes the
line-width of the H$\beta$ emission line as a tracer of the central
gravitational potential. By correcting for the inevitable effects of
inclination, incurred due to the FSQ being viewed close to the line of sight,
we find that the black-hole masses of the FSQ with intrinsically powerful radio
jets are confined, virtually exclusively, to M_bh > 10^8 M_solar. This is in
good agreement with previous studies of optically selected FSQ and
steep-spectrum radio-loud quasars.
  Finally, following the application of a realistic Doppler boosting
correction, we find that the FSQ occupy a wide range in intrinsic radio
luminosity, and that many sources would be more accurately classified as
radio-intermediate or radio-quiet quasars. This range in radio luminosity
suggests that the FSQ are fully consistent with an upper boundary on radio
power of the form L_5GHz \propto M_bh^2.5.

different from standard Laplacian growth patterns of viscous fingering. An

self-force correctly in a specified gauge, it is necessary to find out a gauge
transformation that connects these two gauges. This is called the gauge
problem. As a direct approach to solve the gauge problem, we formulate a method

As an exciting application we present a test of the Maldacena conjecture. We
test the conjecture by evaluating the correlator of the stress-energy tensor in
the strong coupling field theory and comparing to the string theory prediction
of its behavior as a function of the distance. Our numerical results support
the Maldacena conjecture and are within 10-15% of the predicted results.

density of the dark matter. This remarkable phenomenon takes place naturally,
irrespective of the gravitino mass and the reheating temperature of inflation,

most attractive candidate for the origin of the observed baryon asymmetry in

so called 'hard science', like physics or materials science. The example
problem, simulation of ferromagnetic resonance spectra in amorphous wire,
serves as an evidence of their power, even in their simplest, easy to
understand, forms. The spectra, simulated for realistic values of anisotropy
constants, show amazingly rich variety of their forms, probably never suspected
by experimentalists. The method delivers guaranteed values of resonance fields
for any orientation of the sample in the external magnetic field, not just for
specific, 'highly symmetric', analytical cases; no resonance field is ever
missed. The experimental data, to be published elsewhere, are in excellent
concordance with numerical findings.

Schrodinger equation. In analog with the three-dimensional case, the resulting
interaction is referred to as the Fermi pseudo-potential. The dominant feature
of this one-dimensional problem comes from the fact that the real line becomes
disconnected when one point is removed. The general interaction at one point is
found to be the sum of three terms, the well-known delta-function potential and
two Fermi pseudo-potentials, one odd under space reflection and the other even.
The odd one gives the proper interpretation for the delta'(x) potential, while
the even one is unexpected and more interesting. Among the many applications of
these Fermi pseudo-potentials, the simplest one is described. It consists of a
superposition of the delta-function potential and the even pseudo-potential
applied to two-channel scattering. This simplest application leads to a model
of the quantum memory, an essential component of any quantum computer.
