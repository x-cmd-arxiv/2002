J2123-058 to measure the rotational broadening of the binary companion's
stellar absorption lines and determined that the companion's projected
rotational velocity is vsini = 121 (+21)(-29) km/s. This value is considerably
larger than the measurements of vsini obtained previously for three other
neutron star systems where the values are between 34 and 65 km/s. The larger
value is likely due to the combination of high binary inclination and short (6
hr) orbital period for XTE J2123-058. Along with previously measured
parameters, the rotational broadening measurement allowed us to determine the
binary parameters, including the ratio of the neutron star mass to the
companion mass, q = M_1/M_2 = 2.7 (+1.3)(-0.9), the neutron star mass, M_1 =
1.46 (+0.30)(-0.39) solar masses, and the companion mass, M_2 = 0.53
(+0.28)(-0.39) solar masses, assuming a Roche lobe filling companion
synchronously rotating with the binary orbit. These values are consistent with
a previous measurement where the H alpha emission line was used to determine
the semiamplitude of the neutron star's radial velocity curve (K_1). It is a
significant result that the two methods give consistent values. We also report
the first measurement of the XTE J2123-058 companion's radius. Assuming
synchronous rotation, we obtain R_2 = 0.62 (+0.11)(-0.15) solar radii, which is
in-line with that expected for a late K-type star on or close to the main
sequence. Finally, we report the first precise spectroscopic determination of
the binary orbital period (P_orb = 21442.3 +/- 1.8 seconds).

intracluster gas. The discovery of remarkably regular ``cold fronts'', or
contact discontinuities, in merging clusters showed that gas dynamic
instabilities at the boundaries between the moving gases are often suppressed,
most likely by specially structured magnetic fields.
  Cold fronts are not limited to mergers -- Chandra observed them in the cores
of more than 2/3 of the cooling flow clusters, where they often divide the cool
central and the hotter ambient gas phases. The natural state of the low-entropy
central gas in clusters thus appears to be to slosh subsonically in the central
potential well, with several interesting implications. Hydrostatic equilibrium
is not reached and the hydrostatic total mass estimates cannot be valid at
small radii (r<100 kpc). The kinetic energy dissipated by the sloshing gas may
be sufficient to compensate for radiative cooling. In the absence of a recent
merger, the cause of such sloshing is unclear. It might be related to the
mechanical energy generated by the central AGN, evidence of which (the bubbles)
is also observed by Chandra in a large fraction of the cooling flow clusters.
  Heat conduction across cold fronts is suppressed completely. In the bulk of
the gas, it is reduced by a factor of ~10 or more relative to the classic
value, as shown by merger temperature maps. A spatial correlation between the
gas temperature maps and the radio halo maps is observed in several mergers,
which may provide clues for the relativistic particle acceleration mechanisms.

stars in the Galactic bulge can be measured to a few percent accuracy. The
method combines ground-based photometry of caustic-crossing bulge microlensing
events, with a handful of precise astrometric measurements of the lensed star
during the event, to measure the angular radius of the source, theta_*. Dense
photometric coverage of one caustic crossing yields the crossing timescale dt.
Less frequent coverage of the entire event yields the Einstein timescale t_E
and the angle phi of source trajectory with respect to the caustic. The
photometric light curve solution predicts the motion of the source centroid up
to an orientation on the sky and overall scale. A few precise astrometric
measurements therefore yield theta_E, the angular Einstein ring radius. Then
the angular radius of the source is obtained by theta_*=theta_E(dt/t_E)
sin(phi). We argue that theta_* should be measurable to a few percent accuracy
for Galactic bulge giant stars using ground-based photometry from a network of
small (1m-class) telescopes, combined with astrometric observations with a
precision of ~10 microarcsec to measure theta_E. We find that a factor of ~50
times fewer photons are required to measure theta_E to a given precision for
binary-lens events than single-lens events. Adopting parameters appropriate to
the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM), ~7 min of SIM time is required to
measure theta_E to ~5% accuracy for giant sources in the bulge. For
main-sequence sources, theta_E can be measured to ~15% accuracy in ~1.4 hours.
With 10 hrs of SIM time, it should be possible to measure theta_* to ~5% for
\~80 giant stars, or to 15% for ~7 main sequence stars. A byproduct of such a
campaign is a significant sample of precise binary-lens mass measurements.

Psaltis, Belloni & van der Klis (1999) for black hole (BH), neutron star (NS)
systems and then extended by Mauche (2002) to white dwarf (WD) binaries. We
argue that the observed correlation is a natural consequence of the Keplerian
disk flow adjustment to the innermost sub-Keplerian boundary conditions near
the central object. In the framework of the transition layer model the high
frequency is related to the Keplerian frequency at the outer (adjustment)
radius and the low frequency is related to the magnetoacoustic oscillation (MA)
frequency. Using a relation between the MA frequency the magnetic and gas
pressure and the density and the hydrostatic equilibrium condition in the disk
we infer a linear correlation the Keplerian frequency and the MA frequency. We
estimate the magnetic field strength near the TL outer radius for BHs NSs and
WDs. The fact that the observed high-low frequency correlation over five orders
of magnitude is valid for BHs, NSs, and down to WDs strongly rules out
relativistic models for QPO phenomena. We come to the conclusion that the QPOs
observations indicate the adjustment of the geometrically thin disk to
sub-Keplerian motion near the central object. This effect is a common feature
for a wide class of systems, starting from white dwarf binaries up to black
hole binaries.

within the Ly-alpha line. The observed H2 line ratios within these sequences
imply significant line opacity, so we use a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code
to model the line ratios, correcting for opacity effects. We find the observed
line ratios can best be reproduced by assuming that the H2 is fluoresced in a
layer between the observer and Mira B with a temperature and column density of
T=3600 K and log N(H2)=17.3, respectively. The strengths of H2 absorption
features within the Ly-alpha line are roughly consistent with this temperature
and column. We use the total flux fluoresced within the 13 sequences to infer
the Ly-alpha profile seen by the H2. In order to explain differences between
the shape of this and the observed profile, we have to assume that the observed
profile suffers additional interstellar (or circumstellar) H I Ly-alpha
absorption with a column density of about log N(H I)=20.35. We also have to
assume that the observed profile is about a factor of 2.5 lower in flux than
the profile seen by the H2, and a couple possible explanations for this
behavior are presented. Several lines of evidence lead us to tentatively
attribute the fluoresced emission to H2 that is heated in a photodissociation
front within Mira A's wind a few AU from Mira B, although it is possible that
interaction between the winds of Mira A and B may also play a role in heating
the H2. We estimate a Mira B mass loss rate of 5e-13 solar masses per year and
a terminal velocity of 250 km/s, based on wind absorption features in the Mg II
h & k lines. We note, however, that the wind is variable and IUE Mg II spectra
suggest significantly higher mass loss rates during the IUE era.

galactic bulges as predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation in
which the spheroidal components of galaxies are formed by mergers. In bright
ellipticals, the number of events that can eject a central supermassive binary
black hole is large. Central binaries must therefore merge in less than a
Hubble time -- otherwise there will be too much scatter in the M-sigma relation
and too many off-center galactic nuclei. We propose that binary black holes are
able to merge during the major gas accretion events that trigger QSO activity
in galaxies. If this is the case, less than 10 percent of faint ellipticals and
40 percent of bright ellipticals are predicted to harbour binary black holes
with near equal masses at their centres. This binary may be ejected away from
the centre of the galaxy or even into intergalactic space in up to 20 percent
of the most luminous ellipticals. The number of low mass black holes that can
interact with the central object is predicted to be a strong function of galaxy
luminosity. In most faint ellipticals, no black holes fall into the centre of
the galaxy after the last major gas accretion event, but in the most luminous
ellipticals, an average of 10 low mass black holes interact with the central
supermassive object after this time. It is expected that stars will be ejected
from galaxy cores as these low mass-ratio binaries harden. Multiple black holes
in galactic bulges thus provide a natural explanation for the strong systematic
trends in the observed central density profiles of ellipticals as a function of

Numerical calculations for GaAs QWs clarify the different contributions of each

broadening. Interface roughness scattering contributes about an order of
magnitude more to linewidth than to transport broadening, because the
contribution from the intrasubband scattering in the first excited subband is
much larger than that in the ground subband. On the other hand, LO phonon
scattering (at room temperature) and ionized impurity scattering contribute
much less to linewidth than to transport broadening. LA phonon scattering makes
comparable contributions to linewidth and transport broadening, and so does
alloy disorder scattering. The combination of these contributions with
significantly different characteristics makes the absolute values of linewidth

composition, is changed. Our numerical calculations can quantitatively explain

be easily tuned by application of low magnetic fields (< 1 T). The effect is
persistent after the field is turned off, thus the field remains imprinted in
the actual value of f and can be recovered through transport measurements. This
effect is due both to the existence of a true phase separated equilibrium state

excellent agreement with independent electrical transport and single-particle

from the pairing interaction mediated mainly by undamped acoustic plasmons in a
quasi-one-dimensional electronic system.

the tensor product with twisted group rings. This gives an algebraic

constant, g, starting from the vacuum-to-pion correlation function of the
interpolating fields of two nucleons and taking its matrix element with respect
to nucleon spinors. The new approach with the projected correlation function is
advantageous because even in the chiral limit the dispersion integral can be
parametrized with well-defined physical parameters. Another advantage of the
new approach is that unwanted pole contribution is projected out. Calculating
the Wilson coefficients of the operator product expansion of the correlation
function up to O(M_B^{-4}) and O(m_pi) where M_B and m_pi are the Borel mass
and the pion mass, respectively, we construct new QCD sum rules for the pi NN
coupling constant from the projected correlation function with consistently
including O(m_pi) corrections. By numerically analyzing the obtained four sum
rules we identified the most prominent one. After roughly estimating errors we
obtaind, g=10 +/- 3, as a result of this sum rule, which is in reasonable
agreement with the empirical value. It is also found that the O(m_pi)
correction is about 5%.

  22nd-27th,2002",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum cryptography, quantum computer project, space-time quantization
program and recent computer experiments reported by Accardi and his
collaborators show the importance and actuality of the discussion of the
completeness of quantum mechanics (QM) started by Einstein more than 70 years
ago. Many years ago we pointed out that the violation of Bell's inequalities is
neither a proof of completeness of QM nor an indication of the violation of
Einsteinian causality. We also indicated how and in what sense a completeness
of QM might be tested with the help of statistical nonparametric purity tests.
In this paper we review and refine our arguments. We also point out that the
statistical predictions of QM for two-particle correlation experiments do not
give any deterministic prediction for a single pair. After beam is separated we
obtain two beams moving in opposite directions. If the coincidence is reported
it is only after the beams had interacted with corresponding measuring devices
and two particles had been detected. This fact has implications for quantum
cryptography. Namely a series of the measurements performed on the beam by Bob
and converted into a string of bits (secret key) will in general differ, due to
lack of strict anti-correlations, from a secret key found by Alice using the
same procedure.

such a way that one can recover any bit x_i from a corrupted codeword by
querying only a few bits of that word. We use a quantum argument to prove that
LDCs with 2 classical queries need exponential length: m=2^{Omega(n)}.
Previously this was known only for linear codes (Goldreich et al. 02). Our
proof shows that a 2-query LDC can be decoded with only 1 quantum query, and
then proves an exponential lower bound for such 1-query locally
quantum-decodable codes. We also show that q quantum queries allow more
succinct LDCs than the best known LDCs with q classical queries. Finally, we
give new classical lower bounds and quantum upper bounds for the setting of
private information retrieval. In particular, we exhibit a quantum 2-server PIR
scheme with O(n^{3/10}) qubits of communication, improving upon the O(n^{1/3})
bits of communication of the best known classical 2-server PIR.

stemming from the unique definition of all singular integrals in 1 - epsilon

calculations in 1- epsilon dimensions where the limit epsilon --> 0 is taken at
