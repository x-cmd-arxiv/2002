  to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Under the assumptions that molecular clouds are nearly spatially and
temporally isothermal and that the density peaks (``cores'') within them are
formed by turbulent fluctuations, we argue that cores cannot reach a
hydrostatic (or magneto-static) state as a consequence of their formation
process. In the non-magnetic case, stabilization requires a Bonnor-Ebert
truncation at a finite radius, which is not feasible for a single-temperature
flow, unless it amounts to a shock, which is clearly a dynamical feature.
Instead, in this case, cores must be dynamical entities that can either be
pushed into collapse, or else ``rebound'' towards the mean pressure and density
as the parent cloud. Nevertheless, rebounding cores are delayed in their
re-expansion by their own self-gravity. We give a crude estimate for the
re-expansion time as a function of the closeness of the final compression state
to the threshold of instability, finding typical values $\sim 1$ Myr, i.e., of
the order of a few free-fall times. Our results support the notion that not all
cores observed in molecular clouds need to be on route to forming stars, but
that instead a class of ``failed cores'' should exist, which must eventually
re-expand and disperse, and which can be identified with observed starless
cores. In the magnetic case, recent observational and theoretical work suggests
that all cores are critical or supercritical, and are thus qualitatively
equivalent to the non-magnetic case. Our results support the notion that the
entire star formation process is dynamical, with no intermediate hydrostatic
stages.

and underdense probability functions, distributions of nearest neighbour
distances and void sizes and compute the density profiles of voids. These
results are contrasted with the expectations for dark matter (and the
difference examined in terms of the galaxy/dark matter biasing relation) and
are compared to analytic predictions and observational data where available.
The predicted void probability functions are consistent with those measured
from the Center for Astrophysics redshift surveys given the rather large
uncertainties in this relatively small (for studies of voids) observational
sample. The size of the observational sample is too small to probe the bias
between galaxies and dark matter that we predict. We also examine the predicted
properties of galaxies living within voids and contrast these with the general
galaxy population. Our predictions are aimed at forthcoming large galaxy
redshift surveys which should for the first time provide statistically accurate
measures of the void population.

elliptical galaxies can be used to derive important properties of their dark
and luminous matter. The central velocity dispersion sigma_0, appearing in
(e.g.) the Fundamental Plane, is linked to photometric, dynamical and
geometrical properties of (luminous and dark) matter. We find that, inside the
effective radius R_e, the matter traced by the light must largely dominate over
the dark matter (DM), in order to keep the ellipticals close enough to the FP.
This recalls analogous findings for spiral galaxies.
  In particular we also find that cuspy DM distributions, as predicted by
numerical simulations in Lambda CDM cosmology, are unable to explain the very
existence of the FP; in fact, according to this theory, the structural
properties of dark and luminous matter are so interwoven that a curved surface
is predicted in the log-space (sigma_0, R_e, L), rather than a plane. In order
to agree with the FP, CDM halos must have concentrations parameters in the
range of 5-9 (i.e. values significantly lower than the current predictions).
  Assuming a more heuristic approach and allowing for cored DM halos, we find
that the small intrinsic scatter of the FP yields to i) an average value for
the dark-to-light-traced mass ratio inside the length-scale of light R_e of
about 0.3, ii) a mass-to-light ratio of the matter traced by the light
increasing with spheroid luminosity as L^(0.2) in Gunn-r band, with a value of
5.3 at L = 2.7 x 10^{10} L_{sol}.

extend the universality to include non-polynomial potentials. The new

gaps. The eigenvalues see a brick-wall potential at the origin. This would
correspond to sharp edges in a real mesoscopic system or a reflecting boundary.

theoretical and empirical estimates of this entropy. We apply this criterion to

conjunction with the usual ``abundance'' criterion requiring that present
neutralino relic density complies with $0.2<\Omega_{{\tilde\chi^1_0}} < 0.4$

better fitting occurs for the B-ino than for the Higgsino channels, so that the
former seems to be a favored channel along the mass range of $155 \hbox{GeV} <
m_{{\tilde\chi^1_0}} < 230 \hbox{GeV}$. These results are consistent with
neutralino annihilation patterns that emerge from recent theoretical analysis

a rigorous and automatic result of the full, i.e. nonperturbative, nonabelian
nature of the color interaction in quantum chromodynamics. This makes it in
general impossible to describe the color field as a collection of elementary
quanta (gluons). Neither can a quark be an elementary quantum of the quark
field, as the color field of which it is the source is itself a source, making
isolated noninteracting quarks, crucial for a physical particle interpretation,
impossible. In geometrical language, the impossibility of quarks and gluons as
physical elementary particles arises due to the fact that the color Yang-Mills
space does not have a constant trivial curvature.
  In QCD, the particles ``gluons'' and ``quarks'' are merely artifacts of an
approximation method (the perturbative expansion) and are simply absent in the
exact theory. This also coincides with the empirical, experimental evidence.

D-brane with a tachyon decaying inhomogeneously by using a field theoretical
description. It is shown that (i) light-cones governing open strings are
narrower than those governing closed strings and will eventually collapse
inward in all directions except at kinks, where the tachyon remains at the top
of its potential; and that (ii) light-cones governing open strings at a kink
will be narrowed only in the direction perpendicular to the kink surface. It is
also shown that (iii) future-directed light-cones governing open strings near a
kink are tilted towards the kink, compared with those governing closed strings.
The result (i) implies that open strings except at kinks are redshifted,
compared with closed strings, and will eventually cease to be dynamical. On the
other hand, the result (ii) shows that open strings on a kink surface can move
freely along the kink surface and are dynamical but do not feel the existence
of the spatial dimension perpendicular to the kink surface. The result (iii)
indicates that open strings near a kink have tendency to move towards the kink.
Hence, the light-cone structure vividly illustrates how open strings behave
during the dynamical formation of a kink. We also discuss about a possibility
that the early universe has a network of various dimensional D-branes,
black-branes and tachyon matter. A problem associated with the network and a
possible solution to the problem are discussed.

model with infinite-volume extra dimensions. The solution is based on a
nonlinear generally covariant theory of a metastable graviton that leads to a
large-distance modification of gravity.
  From the extra-dimensional standpoint the problem is solved due to the fact
that the four-dimensional vacuum energy curves mostly the extra space. The
four-dimensional curvature is small, being inversely proportional to a positive
power of the vacuum energy. The effects of infinite-volume extra dimensions are
seen by a brane-world observer as nonlocal operators.
  From the four-dimensional perspective the problem is solved because the
zero-mode graviton is extremely weakly coupled to localized four-dimensional
sources. The observable gravity is mediated not by zero mode but, instead, by a
metastable graviton with a lifetime of the order of the present-day Hubble
scale. Therefore, laws of gravity are modified in the infrared above the Hubble
scale. Large wave-length sources, such as the vacuum energy, feel only the
zero-mode interaction and, as a result, curve space very mildly. Shorter
wave-length sources interact predominantly via exchange of the metastable
graviton. Because of this, all standard properties of early cosmology,
including inflation, are intact.

when the speed of propagation is equal to the speed of light. The work extends
the shock matching theory of Smoller and Temple, which characterizes solutions
of the Einstein equations when the spacetime metric is only Lipschitz
continuous across a hypersurface, to the lightlike case. After a brief
introduction to general relativity, we develop the extension of a shock
matching theory after introducing a previously known generalization of the
second fundamental form by Barrabes and Israel. In the development of the
theory we demonstrate that the matching of the generalized second fundamental
form alone is not a sufficient condition for conservation conditions to hold
across the interface. We then use this theory to construct a new exact solution
of the Einstein equations that can be interpreted as an outgoing spherical
shock wave that propagates at the speed of light. The solution is constructed
by matching a Friedman Robertson Walker (FRW) metric, which is a geometric
model for the universe, to a Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) metric, which
models a static isothermal spacetime. The sound speeds, on each side of the
shock, are constant and sub-luminous. Furthermore, the pressure and density are
smaller at the leading edge of the shock, which is consistent with the Lax
entropy condition in classical gas dynamics. However, the shock speed is
greater than all the characteristic speeds. The solution also yields a
surprising result in that the solution is not equal to the limit of previously
known subluminous solutions as they tend to the speed of light.

neural responses to natural stimuli, which are non-Gaussian and exhibit strong
correlations. We have in mind a model in which neurons are selective for a
small number of stimulus dimensions out of the high dimensional stimulus space,
but within this subspace the responses can be arbitrarily nonlinear. Existing
analysis methods are based on correlation functions between stimuli and
responses, but these methods are guaranteed to work only in the case of
Gaussian stimulus ensembles. As an alternative to correlation functions, we
maximize the mutual information between the neural responses and projections of
the stimulus onto low dimensional subspaces. The procedure can be done
iteratively by increasing the dimensionality of this subspace. Those dimensions
that allow the recovery of all of the information between spikes and the full
unprojected stimuli describe the relevant subspace. If the dimensionality of
the relevant subspace indeed is small, it becomes feasible to map out the
neuron's input-output function even under fully natural stimulus conditions.
These ideas are illustrated in simulations on model visual neurons responding
to natural scenes.

interpretation is reconsidered from the modern point of view of quantum
stochastics and information. It is argued that in the orthodox quantum
mechanics there is no place for quantum phenomenology such as events. The
development of quantum measurement theory, initiated by von Neumann, and Bell's
conceptual critics of hidden variable theories indicated a possibility for
resolution of this crisis. This can be done by divorcing the algebra of the
dynamical generators and an extended algebra of the potential (quantum) and the
actual (classical) observables. The latter, called beables, form the center of
the algebra of all observables, as the only visible (macroscopic) observables
must be compatible with any hidden (microscopic) observable.
  It is shown that within this approach quantum causality can be rehabilitated
within event enhanced quantum mechanics (eventum mechanics) in the form of a
superselection rule for compatibility of the consistent histories with the
statistically predictable future. The application of this rule in the form of
the nondemolition principle leads to the statistical inference of the von
Neumann projection postulate, and also to the more general quantum information
dynamics for instantaneous events, spontaneous localizations (i.e. quantum
jumps), and state diffusions (i.e. continuous trajectories). This gives a
dynamical solution, in the form of a Dirac boundary value problem and reduced
filtering equations, of the notorious decoherence and measurement problems
which was tackled unsuccessfully by many famous mathematicians and physicists
starting with von Neumann, Schroedinger and Bohr.

operator in an open quantum system. An expression for the rate of change of the
Wigner function as a sum of integrals is one of the forms of the Weyl
representation for this equation. The semiclassical description of the Wigner
function in terms of chords, each with its classically defined amplitude and
phase, is thus inserted in the integrals, which leads to an explicit
differential equation for the Wigner function. All the Lindblad operators are
assumed to be represented by smooth phase space functions corresponding to
classical variables. In the case that these are real, representing hermitian
operators, the semiclassical Lindblad equation can be integrated. There results
a simple extension of the unitary evolution of the semiclassical Wigner
function, which does not affect the phase of each chord contribution, while
dampening its amplitude. This decreases exponentially, as governed by the time
integral of the square difference of the Lindblad functions along the classical
trajectories of both tips of each chord. The decay of the amplitudes is shown
to imply diffusion in energy for initial states that are nearly pure.
Projecting the Wigner function onto an orthogonal position or momentum basis,
the dampening of long chords emerges as the exponential decay of off-diagonal
elements of the density matrix.
