likely to intercept low column density neutral hydrogen with log N(HI) >~ 13.0.
The ubiquity of detections implies a covering factor of ~ 100% for low N(HI)
gas around galaxies within 200 h-1 kpc. We discuss the difficulty in trying to
associate individual absorption components with the selected galaxies and their
neighbors, but show that by degrading our STIS data to lower resolutions, we
are able to reproduce the anti-correlation of Lya equivalent width and impact
parameter found at higher redshift. We also show that the equivalent width and
column density of Lya complexes (when individual components are summed over ~
1000 km/s) correlate well with a simple estimate of the volume density of
galaxies brighter than M(B) = -17.5 at the same redshift as a Lya complex. We
do not reject the hypothesis that the selected galaxies are directly

the LBV AG Carinae. AG Carinae resides in a region which is very rich in
molecular gas with complex motions. We find evidence of a slow outflow of
molecular gas, expanding at ~ 7 km/s. This emission appears spatially
unresolved. We argue that it is spatially localised, rather than extended, and
possibly associated with the immediate circumstellar region of AG Carinae. Does
it originate from a circumstellar envelope, similar to carbon stars, or from a
circumstellar disk? The option of the circumstellar disk is preferable because
it is consistent with additional independent indications for the existence of
wind asymmetries in close proximity to the central star, found from
spectropolarimetry and analysis of the UV and optical line profiles, and it
provides the conditions of density and shielding necessary for the survival of
the CO molecules in proximity to such a hot star (Teff ~ 14000 K - 20000 K). In
the assumption that the CO emission originated when AG Carinae was in an
evolved state, we derive a lower limit to the mass of molecular gas of 2.8
solar masses. This is smaller, but still comparable with the mass of ionized
gas present in the circumstellar environment (4.2 solar masses), with the
implication that the molecular gas fraction can contribute significantly to the
overall mass lost from the central star in its post main sequence evolution.

both directions. When two oppositely directed waves collide, they distort each
other, without changing their respective energies. In weak MHD turbulence, a
given wave suffers many collisions before cascading. ""Imbalance"" means that
more energy is going in one direction than the other. In general, MHD
turbulence is imbalanced. A number of complications arise for the imbalanced
cascade that are unimportant for the balanced one.
  We solve weak MHD turbulence that is imbalanced. Of crucial importance is
that the energies going in both directions are forced to equalize at the
dissipation scale. We call this the ""pinning"" of the energy spectra. It affects
the entire inertial range.
  Weak MHD turbulence is particularly interesting because perturbation theory
is applicable. Hence it can be described with a simple kinetic equation.
Galtier et al. (2000) derived this kinetic equation. We present a simpler, more
physical derivation, based on the picture of colliding wavepackets. In the
process, we clarify the role of the zero-frequency mode. We also explain why
Goldreich & Sridhar claimed that perturbation theory is inapplicable, and why
this claim is wrong. (Our ""weak"" is equivalent to Goldreich & Sridhar's
""intermediate."")
  We perform numerical simulations of the kinetic equation to verify our
claims. We construct simplified model equations that illustrate the main
effects. Finally, we show that a large magnetic Prandtl number does not have a
significant effect, and that hyperviscosity leads to a pronounced bottleneck

ionization-loss-flattened distribution of either sub-relativistic protons or
mildly-relativistic electrons. The strong shock of the SNR RX J1713.7-3946,
which presumably interacts with the molecular cloud, as evidenced by
observations of CO-lines, seems to be a natural site of acceleration of such
sub- or mildly-relativistic nonthermal particles. However, the observed X-ray
luminosity of 1.7 10^35 erg/s (for 6 kpc distance) requires that a huge kinetic
energy of about 10^50 erg be released in the form of nonthermal particles to
illuminate the cloud. The shock-acceleration at RX J1713.7-3946 can barely
satisfy this energetic requirement, unless (i) the source is located much
closer than 6 kpc and/or (ii) the mechanical energy of the explosion
essentially exceeds 10^51 erg. Another possibility would be that an essential
part of the ""lost"" energy is somehow converted to plasma waves, which return
this energy to nonthermal particles through their turbulent reacceleration on
plasma waves. Irrespective of mechanisms responsible for production of
high-energy particles, the flat X-ray emission seems to be a signature of a new
striking energetic phenomenon in molecular clouds.

30kpc. For a sample of 22 SNe Ia at <z> = 0.6, 70% are found in spiral galaxies

maps for two host galaxies and find that both show a non-uniform colour

attributed to the presence of, and variation in dust extinction in these

low. This suggests that the range of host galaxy extinctions of SNe Ia at z~0.6

dispersion is found to remain constant at large radii, rather than decrease

the acceleration at which the effect of dark matter becomes relevant in

has been analysed within a one-particle approximation, by considering a wire
piece as an independent scatterer and solving the scattering problem with the
impedance boundary condition. A new integro-differential equation for the
current distribution in a wire is obtained, which is valid for the surface
impedance matrix of a general form. In the vicinity of the antenna resonance,
the dispersion behaviour of the effective permittivity can depend strongly on a
dc external magnetic field applied to the whole composite sample, experiencing
a transformation from a resonant spectrum to a relaxation one. If the
resonance-like dispersion behaviour is realised, the real part of the effective
permittivity can be made negative past the resonance for sufficiently small
wire-inclusion concentrations (well below the percolation threshold). Applying
a dc external magnetic field, the negative peak of the real part of effective
permittivity continuously decreases as the dispersion tends to become of a
relaxation type. The magnetic field required to cause these changes in the
effective permittivity is of the order of the anisotropy field, that is, in the
range of few Oe for Co-based microwires. The field dependence of the effective
permittivity arises from a high sensitivity of the ac surface impedance of a
ferromagnetic wire to a magnetic field (known as the magneto-impedance (MI)
effect). This work demonstrates a possibility of using the MI effect to design
field-controlled composites and band-gap structures. Another range of
applications is related to tuneable waveguides where the composite material is

approximation (GGA) to calculate: (i) the zero temperature equation of state
(EOS) of Ta for bcc, fcc, and hcp crystal structures for pressures up to ~500
GPa. (ii) Elastic constants. (iii) We use a mixed-basis pseudopotential code to
calculate volume relaxed vacancy formation energy also as a function of
pressure. In developing the Ta FF we also use previous QM calculations of: (iv)
the equation of state for the A15 structure. (v) the surface energy bcc (100).
(vi) energetics for shear twinning of the bcc crystal. We find that
withappropriate parameters an embedded atom model force field (denoted as qEAM
FF) is able to reproduce all this QM data. Thus, the same FF describes with
good accuracy the bcc, fcc, hcp and A15 phases of Ta for pressures from ~ -10
GPa to \~ 500 GPa, while also describing the vacancy, surface energy, and shear
transformations. The ability of this single FF to describe such a range of
systems with a variety of coordinations suggests that it would be accurate for
describing defects such as dislocations, grain boundaries, etc.

such finite temperature properties as the melting curve up to 300 GPa; we
obtain a zero pressure melting temperature of T_{melt}=3150 +/- 50 K in good
agreement with experiment (3213-3287 K). We also report on the thermal

minimized with the Landau-level expansion method using up to 3000 Landau
levels. This system can sustain various exotic vortices by either (i) shifting
vortex cores among different components or (ii) filling in cores with
components not used in the bulk. In addition, the phase near the upper critical
angular velocity Omega_{c2} is neither the A nor B phases, but the polar state
with the smallest superfluid density as already shown by Schopohl. Thus,
multiple phases are anticipated to exist in the p-Omega plane. Six different
phases are found in the present calculation performed over 0.0001 Omega_{c2} <=
Omega <= Omega_{c2}, where Omega_{c2} is of order (1- T/T_c) times 10^{7}

bounded composite materials is developed. The method is essentially based on
the renormalisation of the dielectric matrix parameters to account for the
surface polarisation and the displacement currents at the interfaces. This
makes it possible the use of the effective medium theory developed for
unbounded materials, where the spatially-dependent local dielectric constant
and magnetic permeability are introduced. A detailed mathematical analysis is
given for a dielectric layer having conducting fibres with in-plane positions.
The surface effects are most essential at microwave frequencies in
correspondence to the resonance excitation of fibres. In thin layers (having a
thickness of the transition layer), the effective dielectric constant has a
dispersion region at much higher frequencies compared to those for unbounded
materials, exhibiting a strong dependence on the layer thickness. For the
geometry considered, the effective magnetic permeability differs slightly from
unity and corresponds to the renormalised matrix parameter. The magnetic effect
is due entirely to the existence of the surface displacement currents.

that the quasi-liquid becomes unstable above the critical supersaturation

unstable quasi-liquid layer continues growing indefinitely. We interpret this
behavior as corresponding to continuous production and overflow onto
neighboring faces in a real system. We hypothesize that the unstable growth of
snow crystals originates from the edges and vertices, and it is due to the
overflow of quasi-liquid from the edges and vertices onto the neighboring

E >> G^{-1/2}, using the gravitons, whose transverse momenta are cut at the
Planck scale, as partons. For this purpose we represent the gravitational
shock-wave accompanying the fast particle in terms of such partons and take
into account the higher order multiperipheral-like contributions. We argue that
the internal part of this shock plane contains the ``black'' disk of radius
R(E) ~ E^{1/2} filled by such hard partons with the Planck density. When two
fast particles collide the hard graviton production comes from the region of
intersection of their black disks. The corresponding value of inclusive
cross-section at the given rapidity and the impact parameter is proportional to
the area of this region. The final state with such hard gravitons is unstable
relative to the long range gravitational repulsion, and this leads to the
creation of the multiperipheral chain of black holes at later stages of the
reaction. We discuss various details of this picture including higher order
corrections and there connection to a purely classical approach; we also
consider briefly possible changes when additional hidden dimensions are
present.

given by a single superfield that describes the quantum states of a
12-dimensional supersymmetric particle. The particle has super phase space
(X,P,Theta) with (10,2) signature and 32 fermions. The worldline action is
constructed as a generalization of the supersymmetric particle action in
Two-Time Physics. SU(2,2|4) is a linearly realized global supersymmetry of the
2T action. The action is invariant under the gauge symmetries Sp(2,R),
SO(4,2),SO(6), and fermionic kappa. These gauge symmetries insure unitarity and
causality while allowing the reduction of the 12-dimensional super phase space
to the correct super phase space for AdS(5)xS(5) or M(4)xR(6) with 16 fermions
and one time, or other dually related one time spaces. One of the predictions
of this formulation is that all of the SU(2,2|4) representations that describe
Kaluza-Klein towers in AdS(5)xS(5) or M(4)xR(6) supergravity universally have
vanishing eigenvalues for all the Casimir operators. This prediction has been
verified directly in AdS(5)xS(5) supergravity. This suggests that the
supergravity spectrum supports a hidden (10,2) structure. A possible duality
between AdS(5)xS(5) and M(4)xR(6) supergravities is also indicated.

developed based on the properties of an example stimulus ensemble. An extensive
set of echoes (84 800) from four different foliages was transcribed into a
spike code using a parsimonious model (linear filtering, half-wave
rectification, thresholding). The spike code is assumed to consist of time
differences (interspike intervals) between threshold crossings. Among the
elementary interspike intervals flanked by exceedances of adjacent thresholds,
a few intervals triggered by disjoint half-cycles of the carrier oscillation
stand out in terms of resolvability, visibility across resolution scales and a
simple stochastic structure (uncorrelatedness). They are therefore argued to be
a stochastic analogue to edges in vision. A three-dimensional feature vector
representing these interspike intervals sustained a reliable target
classification performance (0.06% classification error) in a sequential
probability ratio test, which models sequential processing of echo trains by
biological sonar systems. The dimensions of the representation are the first
moments of duration and amplitude location of these interspike intervals as
well as their number. All three quantities are readily reconciled with known
principles of neural signal representation, since they correspond to the center
of gravity of excitation on a neural map and the total amount of excitation.

magneto-impedance (MI) effect in amorphous wires in terms of the surface
impedance tensor. Physical concepts of MI and problems of significant practical
importance are discussed using the results obtained. The theoretical analysis
is based on employing the asymptotic-series expansion method of solving the
Maxwell equations for a ferromagnetic wire with an ac permeability tensor of a
general form associated with magnetisation rotation. The magnetic
structure-dependent impedance tensor is calculated for any frequency and
external magnetic field, and is not restricted to the case when only strong
skin-effect is present. This approach allows us to develop a rigorous
quantitative analysis of MI characteristics in wires, depending on the type of
magnetic anisotropy, the magnitude of dc bias current, and an excitation
method. The theoretical model has been tested by comparing the obtained results
with experiment. For the sake of an adequate comparison, the full impedance
tensor is measured in CoFeSiB and CoSiB amorphous wires having a
circumferential and helical anisotropy, respectively, by determining the S21
parameter. In cases, when the rotational dynamics is responsible for the
impedance behaviour, there is a reasonable agreement between the experimental
and theoretical results. Such effects as the ac biased asymmetrical MI in wires
with a circumferential anisotropy, the transformation in MI behaviour caused by
a dc current (from that having a symmetric hysteresis to an asymmetric
anhysteretic one) in wires with a helical anisotropy are discussed.

to build scalable quantum computers, it appears that simulation of quantum
computation will be at least as critical as circuit simulation in classical
VLSI design. However, since the work of Richard Feynman in the early 1980s
little progress was made in practical quantum simulation. Most researchers
focused on polynomial-time simulation of restricted types of quantum circuits
that fall short of the full power of quantum computation. Simulating quantum
computing devices and useful quantum algorithms on classical hardware now
requires excessive computational resources, making many important simulation
tasks infeasible. In this work we propose a new technique for gate-level
simulation of quantum circuits which greatly reduces the difficulty and cost of
such simulations. The proposed technique is implemented in a simulation tool
called the Quantum Information Decision Diagram (QuIDD) and evaluated by
simulating Grover's quantum search algorithm. The back-end of our package,
QuIDD Pro, is based on Binary Decision Diagrams, well-known for their ability
to efficiently represent many seemingly intractable combinatorial structures.
This reliance on a well-established area of research allows us to take
advantage of existing software for BDD manipulation and achieve unparalleled
empirical results for quantum simulation.

groups of patients to take or not to take it, respectively. It is well-known
that the causal effect cannot be identified if not all patients comply. This
holds even when the non-compliers can be identified afterwards since latent
factors like patient's personality can influence both his decision and his
physical response. However, one can still give bounds on the effectiveness of
the drug depending on the rate of compliance. Remarkably, the proofs of these
bounds given in the literature rely on models that represent all relevant
latent factors (including noise) by hidden classical variables. In strong
analogy to the violation of Bell's inequality, some of these bounds fail if
patient's behavior is influenced by latent quantum processes (e.g. in his
nervous system). Quantum effects could fake an increase of the recovery rate by
about 13% although the drug would hurt as many patients as it would help if
everyone took it. The other bounds are true even in the quantum case.

describes the rapid evolution of a superposition of macroscopically

for a physical resolution to the so-called ""measurement problem."" Such models
have experimentally testable differences from standard quantum theory. The most
well developed such model at present is the Continuous Spontaneous Localization
(CSL) model in which a fluctuating classical field interacts with particles to
cause collapse. One ""side effect"" of this interaction is that the field imparts
momentum to particles, causing a small blob of matter to undergo random walk.
Here we explore this in order to supply predictions which could be
experimentally tested. We examine the translational diffusion of a sphere and a
disc, and the rotational diffusion of a disc, according to CSL. For example, we
find that a disc of radius 2 cdot 10^{-5} cm and thickness 0.5 cdot 10^{-5} cm
diffuses through 2 pi rad in about 70sec (this assumes the ""standard"" CSL
parameter values). The comparable rms diffusion of standard quantum theory is
smaller than this by a factor 10^-3. At the reported pressure of < 5
cdot10^{-17} Torr, achieved at 4.2^{circ} K, the mean time between air molecule
collisions with the disc is approximately 45min (and the diffusion caused by
photon collisons is utterly negligible). This is ample time for observation of
the putative CSL diffusion over a wide range of parameters.

performed, and the paper closes with some thoughts on this subject
