seven-month mission will use a 50-cm telescope and four-channel imager to
survey the sky from a circular orbit above the Earth. Expected sensitivities
will be half a million times that of COBE/DIRBE at 3.5 and 4.7 um and a
thousand times that of IRAS at 12 and 23 um. NGSS will be particularly
sensitive to brown dwarfs cooler than those presently known. Deep absorption in
the methane fundamental band at 3.3 um and a predicted 5-um overluminosity will
produce uniquely red 3.5-to-4.7 um colors for such objects. For a limiting
volume of 25 pc, NGSS will completely inventory the Solar Neighborhood for
brown dwarfs as cool as Gl 229B. At 10 pc, the census will be complete to 500
K. Assuming a field mass function with alpha = 1, there could be one or more
brown dwarfs warmer than 150 K lying closer to the Sun than Proxima Centauri
and detectable primarily at NGSS wavelengths. NGSS will enable estimates of the
brown dwarf mass and luminosity functions to very cool temperatures and will
provide both astrometric references and science targets for NGST.

using power-law initial spectra. The nonlinear evolution of the matter power
spectra is compared with the predictions of existing analytic scaling formulae
based on the work of Hamilton et al. The scaling approach has assumed that
highly nonlinear structures obey `stable clustering' and are frozen in proper
coordinates. Our results show that, when transformed under the self-similarity
scaling, the scale-free spectra define a nonlinear locus that is clearly
shallower than would be required under stable clustering. Furthermore, the
small-scale nonlinear power increases as both the power-spectrum index n and
the density parameter Omega decrease, and this evolution is not well accounted
for by the previous scaling formulae. This breakdown of stable clustering can
be understood as resulting from the modification of dark-matter haloes by
continuing mergers. These effects are naturally included in the analytic `halo
model' for nonlinear structure; using this approach we are able to fit both our
scale-free results and also our previous CDM data. This approach is more
accurate than the commonly-used Peacock--Dodds formula and should be applicable
to more general power spectra. Code to evaluate nonlinear power spectra using
this method is available from

were incorporated into a modified version of the ZEUS-MP code. The simulations
followed not only the active phase of the radio source, but also the long term
behaviour for up to 2 Gyr after the jets of the radio source were switched off.
We find as expected that the radio source has a significant effect on the
cooling flow while it is active, however we also find that the effects of the
radio source on the cluster are long-lived. A buoyancy driven convective flow
is established as the remnants of the radio source rise through the cluster
dragging material from the cluster core. Although the central Mpc of the
cluster reverts to having a cooling flow, this asymmetric convective flow is
able to remove the cool gas accumulating at the cluster core and indeed there
is a net outflow persisting for timescales of about an order of magnitude
longer than the time for which the source is active or longer. The convective
flow may also provide a mechanism to enhance the metallicity of the cluster gas
at large cluster radii.

emission from a parsec-scale counterjet. Previous VLBI images at 1.6 GHz have
set a lower limit for the jet/counterjet brightness ratio near the core at
about 80:1, which is larger than expected given the evidence that the radio
axis is fairly close to the plane of the sky. A possible explanation is that
the inner few pc of the counterjet is hidden by free-free absorption by ionized
gas associated with an accretion disk or torus. This would be consistent with
the nearly edge-on appearance of the arcsecond-scale dust disk seen in the
center of NGC 6251 by HST. We detect counterjet emission close to the core at
1.6 GHz, but not at the higher frequencies. Given that the optical depth of
free-free absorption falls off more rapidly with increasing frequency than the
optically thin synchrotron emission from a typical radio jet, this result
implies that the absence of a detectable parsec-scale counterjet at high
frequencies is not due to free-free absorption unless the density of ionized
gas is extremely high and we have misidentified the core at 1.6 GHz. The most
likely alternative is a large jet/counterjet brightness ratio caused by
relativistic beaming, which in turn requires the inner radio axis to be closer
to our line of sight than the orientation of the HST dust disk would suggest.

source. We identify this source as the afterglow of GRB 020405. Subsequent
observations by other groups found varying polarized flux and established a
redshift of 0.690 to the host galaxy. Motivated by the low redshift we
triggered observations with WFPC2 on-board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
Modeling the early ground-based data with a jet model, we find a clear red
excess over the decaying optical lightcurves that is present between day 10 and
day 141 (the last HST epoch). This `bump' has the spectral and temporal
features expected of an underlying supernova (SN). In particular, the red color
of the putative SN is similar to that of the SN associated with GRB 011121, at

show that high-velocity OVI is very common, having equivalent width >65 mAA in
50% of the sightlines and >30 mAA in 70% of the high-quality sightlines. The
high-velocity OVI absorption has velocities relative to the LSR of

However, there have been few attempts to model these features quantitatively.
Here, we describe a new, hybrid Monte Carlo/Sobolev code, which allows us to
synthesize the complete spectrum of a disk-dominated, mass-losing CV.
  The line profiles we calculate for C IV resemble those calculated by previous

exhibit not only the well-known resonance lines of O VI, N V, Si IV and C IV,

been seen in the far ultraviolet spectra of CVs obtained with HUT, FUSE, and

far, due to their high temperature and low density. One of the few ways to
detect this matter is to look for its UV absorption signature on the light from

Hard X-ray emission is correlated fairly well with the edges of regions of
radio emission, suggesting that these are the locations of shock waves at which
both short-lived X-ray emitting electrons, and longer-lived radio-emitting
electrons, are accelerated. Soft X-rays are spatially well-correlated with
optical emission from nonradiative shocks, which are almost certainly portions
of the outer blast wave. These soft X-rays are well fit with simple thermal
plane-shock models. Harder X-rays show Fe K alpha emission and are well
described with a similar soft thermal component, but a much stronger
synchrotron continuum dominating above 2 keV, and a strong Fe K alpha line.
Quantitative analysis of this line and the surrounding continuum shows that it
cannot be produced by thermal emission from a cosmic-abundance plasma; the
ionization time is too short, as shown both by the low centroid energy (6.4
keV) and the absence of oxygen lines below 1 keV. Instead, a model of a plane
shock into Fe-rich ejecta, with a synchrotron continuum, provides a natural
explanation. This requires that reverse shocks into ejecta be accelerating
electrons to energies of order 50 TeV. We show that maximum energies of this
order can be produced by radiation-limited diffusive shock acceleration at the
reverse shocks.

is a star as luminous as the cluster turnoff stars, but with a lower Teff (a
larger radius) which we model with a star of initial mass compatible with the
masses evolving in the cluster (~0.85 Msun). This star has suffered Roche lobe
overflow while evolving off the main sequence, spinning up the neutron star to
the present period of 3.65 ms. There are evidences that at present, Roche lobe
overflow is still going on. Indeed Roche lobe deformation of the mass losing
component is necessary to be compatible with the optical light curve. The
presence of matter around the system is also consistent with the long lasting
irregular radio eclipses seen in the system. We propose that this system is
presently in a phase of `radio-ejection' mass loss. The radio-ejection phase
can be initiated only if the system is subject to intermittency in the mass
transfer during the spin-up phase. In fact, when the system is detached the
pulsar radio emission is not quenched, and may be able to prevent further mass
accretion due to the action of the pulsar pressure at the inner Lagrangian
point.

to the topology of the ionized regions. If reionization proceeded from high to
low density regions then the cross-correlation will be negative, while if voids
were ionized first then we expect a positive correlation and a relatively small
number of long neutral segments. We test the sensitivity of these statistics
for reionization by stars in high redshift galaxies. The flux of ionizing
radiation emitted from stars is estimated by identifying galaxies in an N-body
simulation using a semi-analytic galaxy formation model. The spatial
distribution of ionized gas is traced in various models for the propagation of

another galaxy. This major merger causes spheroid formation of the host galaxy.
Our model can reproduce not only general form of the galaxy luminosity
functions in the local Universe but also the observed relation between a
supermassive black hole mass and a spheroid luminosity, the present black hole
mass function and the quasar luminosity functions at different redshifts. Using
this model, we predict the mean number of quasars per halo, bias parameter of

that the spatial distribution of galaxies is different from that of quasars.

most quasars seem to reside in more varied environments than at a lower

  F.Jansen & TBD, 2002, ESA SP-488 (in press)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We propose a new approach for studying the neutron star/supernova remnant
associations, based on the idea that the supernova remnants (SNRs) can be
products of an off-centered supernova (SN) explosion in a preexisting bubble
created by the wind of a moving massive star. A cavity SN explosion of a moving
star results in a considerable offset of the neutron star (NS) birth-place from
the geometrical center of the SNR. Therefore: a) the high transverse velocities
inferred for a number of NSs through their association with SNRs can be
reduced; b) the proper motion vector of a NS should not necessarily point away
from the geometrical center of the associated SNR. Taking into account these
two facts allow us to enlarge the circle of possible NS/SNR associations, and
could significantly affect the results of previous studies of associations. The
possibilities of our approach are illustrated with some examples. We also show
that the concept of an off-centered cavity SN explosion could be used to
explain the peculiar structures of a number of SNRs and for searches for
stellar remnants possibly associated with them.

in the southwest protrusion of the supernova remnant G 315.4-2.30 (MSH 14-63,

was motivated by a hypothesis that G 315.4-2.30 is the result of an
off-centered cavity supernova explosion of a moving massive star, which ended
its evolution just near the edge of the main-sequence wind-driven bubble. This
hypothesis implies that the southwest protrusion in G 315.4-2.30 is the
remainder of a pre-existing bow shock-like structure created by the interaction
of the supernova progenitor's wind with the interstellar medium and that the
actual location of the supernova blast center is near the center of this
hemispherical structure. We have discovered two point X-ray sources in the
""proper"" place. One of the sources has an optical counterpart with the
photographic magnitude $13.38\pm0.40$, while the spectrum of the source can be
fitted with an optically thin plasma model. We interpret this source as a
foreground active star of late spectral type. The second source has no optical
counterpart to a limiting magnitude $\sim 21$. The spectrum of this source can
be fitted almost equally well with several simple models (power law: photon
index $=1.87$; two-temperature blackbody: $kT_1 =0.11$ keV, $R_1 =2.34 $ km and
$kT_2 =0.71$ keV, $R_2 =0.06$ km; blackbody plus power law: $kT =0.07$ keV,
photon index $=2.3$). We interpret this source as a candidate stellar remnant
(neutron star), while the photon index and non-thermal luminosity of the source
(almost the same as those of the Vela pulsar and the recently discovered pulsar
PSR J 0205+6449 in the supernova remnant 3C 58) suggest that it can be a young

gravitationally heated to ~10^6 K and therefore emitting in the soft X-rays. We
have detected diffuse soft X-ray structures in a high Galactic latitude ROSAT
field after point source subtraction and correction for Galactic absorption.
These diffuse structures have an X-ray energy distribution that is much softer
than expected from clusters, groups or unresolved emission from AGNs, but are
consistent with that expected from a diffuse warm intergalactic medium. To
discriminate between a Galactic or extragalactic nature of the diffuse gas we
have correlated the soft X--map with multiband optical images in this field. We
have found a significant overdensity of galaxies in correspondence with the
strongest diffuse X-ray structure. The photometric redshift distribution of the
galaxies over the X-ray peak has an excess over field galaxies at z~0.45. This
result strongly suggests that the diffuse X-ray flux is due to extragalactic
emission by warm gas associated with an overdense galaxy region at z~0.45.

using a Monte Carlo code. The dominant opacity contribution for nu_mu and

destruction of neutrino pairs, notably nucleon bremsstrahlung, the e^+ e^- pair
annihilation process and nu_e-bar nu_e -> nu_{mu,tau} nu_{mu,tau}-bar, recoil
and weak magnetism in elastic nucleon scattering, elastic scattering on
electrons and positrons and elastic scattering on electron neutrinos and
anti-neutrinos. The least important processes are neutrino-neutrino scattering
and e^+ e^- annihilation. The formation of the spectra and fluxes of nu_mu is
dominated by the nucleonic processes, i.e. bremsstrahlung and elastic
scattering with recoil, but also nu_e nu_e-bar annihilation and nu_mu e^\pm
scattering contribute significantly. When all processes are included, the
spectral shape of the emitted neutrino flux is always ``pinched,'' i.e. the
width of the spectrum is smaller than that of a thermal spectrum with the same
average energy. In all of our cases we find that the average nu_mu-bar energy
exceeds the average nu_e-bar energy by only a small amount, 10% being a typical
number. Weak magnetism effects cause the opacity of nu_mu to differ slightly
from that of nu_mu-bar, translating into differences of the luminosities and
average energies of a few percent. Depending on the density, temperature, and
composition profile, the flavor-dependent luminosities L_{nu_e}$, L_{nu_e-bar},

to reality. I comment on how we might make the transition. We already have some
serious tests of gravity physics on the length and time scales of cosmology.
The evidence for consistency with general relativity theory is still rough, but
impressive, considering the enormous extrapolation from the empirical basis,
and these probes of gravity physics will be considerably improved by work in
progress on the cosmological tests. The CDM model has some impressive
observational successes too, and some challenges, not least of which is that
the model is based on a wonderfully optimistic view of the simplicity of
physics in the dark sector. I present as a cautionary example a model for dark
matter and dark energy that biases interpretations of cosmological observations
that assume the CDM model. In short, cosmology has become an empirically rich
subject with a well-motivated standard model, but it needs work to be

electrons and elementary magnetic cells appears in such a way that the
resulting local polarization and magnetization break the local relativistic
crystalline symmetry. Therefore, Goldstone bosons, also associated to toroidal
moments, are created and, as a consequence, corresponding toroidal phases in
crystals. The list of the Shubnikov groups compatible with this kind of phases
is given and possible consequences in superconductor theory in magnetoelectric
crystals are examined.

the breaking of the one-cell relativistic crystalline symmetry (RCS) associated
to any given crystal into which non-trivial magnetoelectric coupling effects
(ME) exist. Indeed, in this kind of crystals, any interaction between a charge
carrier and an elementary magnetic cell can breaks the RCS of this previous
given cell by varying, in the simplest case, the continuous defining parameters
of the initial RCS. This breaking can be associated to a change of the initial
Galilean proper frame of any given carrier to an ""effective"" one, into which
the RCS of the interacting cell is kept. We can speak of a kind of ""inverse""
kineto-magnetoelectric effect. The magnetic groups compatible with such process
have been computed. Moreover, one can notice that the TM's break the P and T
symmetries but not the PT one as in anyons theories. This breaking creates
so-called Nambu-Goldstone bosons generating ""effective"" magnetic monopoles.
These consequences allow us to claim, first, that anyons are charge carriers
associated with ""effective"" magnetic monopoles, both with TM's, and second,
that ME can be highly considered in superconductors theory.

close to one. As for the substitutional disorder, scattering on random
Jahn-Teller distortions of MnO6 octahedra is chosen. We emphasize an intimate
correlation between the carrier concentration and resistivity value of metallic

a canted A-phase for both in-plane and out-of-plane current directions. A
contact between two manganite phases is considered and structure of the
transition region near the contact is discussed. Numerical calculations show
charge re-distribution near the contact and a large screening length of the
order of five inter-atomic distances. We employed our results to interpret data
obtained in recent experiments on La0.4Sr0.6MnO3/La0.55Sr0.45MnO3

the polymer osmotic pressure is independent of polymer molecular weight (the
des Cloizeaux semi-dilute regime of bulk polymer solutions). The condition that
attached polymers behave as semi-dilute bulk solutions offers a rigorous

in type-II superconductors are developed based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
equations for vortex-lattice states. As the pair potential grows through the
superconducting transition, each degenerate Landau level in the normal state
splits into quasiparticle bands in the magnetic Brillouin zone. This brings
Landau-level broadening, which in turn leads to the extra dHvA oscillation
damping in the vortex state. We perform extensive numerical calculations for
three-dimensional systems with various gap structures. It is thereby shown that
(i) this Landau-level broadening is directly connected with the average gap at
H=0 along each Fermi-surface orbit perpendicular to the field H; (ii) the extra
dHvA oscillation attenuation is caused by the broadening around each extremal
orbit. These results imply that the dHvA experiment can be a unique probe to
detect band- and/or angle-dependent gap amplitudes. We derive an analytic
expression for the extra damping based on the second-order perturbation with
respect to the pair potential for the Luttinger-Ward thermodynamic potential.
This formula reproduces all our numerical results excellently, and is used to
estimate band-specific gap amplitudes from available data on NbSe_2, Nb_3Sn,
and YNi_2B_2C. The obtained value for YNi_2B_2C is fairly different from the
one through a specific-heat measurement, indicating presence of gap anisotropy

spins in solids, but it is believed to have little impact on the crystal
structure. This common perception has been challenged recently by ferromagnetic
shape-memory alloys, where the spin-lattice coupling is so strong that
crystallographic axes even in a fixed sample are forced to rotate, following
the direction of moments. One would, however, least expect any structural
change to be induced in antiferromagnets where spins are antiparallel and give
no net moment. Here we report on such unexpected magnetic shape-memory effects
that take place ironically in one of the best-studied 2D antiferromagnets,
La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO). We find that lightly-doped LSCO crystals tend to align
their b axis along the magnetic field, and if the crystal orientation is fixed,
this alignment occurs through the generation and motion of crystallographic
twin boundaries. Both resistivity and magnetic susceptibility exhibit curious
switching and memory effects induced by the crystal-axes rotation; moreover,
clear kinks moving over the crystal surfaces allow one to watch the crystal
rearrangement directly with a microscope or even bare eyes.

on the assumption of coexistence of confined and deconfined phases in a finite

a partition function (PF) with the exact color-singletness requirement. A
problem arises in the limit of small QGP volumes when using the usual
color-singlet partition function (CSPF) derived in the saddle point
approximation. To avoid the problem, we have then proposed a method for
calculating a suitable CSPF, which allows us to accurately calculate physical
quantities describing well the DPT at finite volumes. We show that in the limit
of infinite volume, these thermodynamic quantities exhibit a discontinuity at a
critical point Tc(infinity) (or muc(infinity)). In a finite size system, all
singularities are smoothed out over a broadened critical region, shifted from
the critical point position in the thermodynamic limit. The first derivatives
of these thermodynamic quantities show delta function singularities at the
critical point in the thermodynamic limit, while in a finite volume, these
delta singularities are smeared into finite peaks of widths deltaT(V) (or
deltamu(V)), with the maxima of the peaks occuring at pseudo-critical points

criticality of these maxima as well as of the width of the transition region

exponents characterizing the DPT. Our results are in good agreement with those

revealed already typical ingredients of threshold studies, which were
superseded by more complete meson production investigations at the nucleon beam
facilities TRIUMF, LAMPF, PSI, LEAR and SATURNE. Currently, with the advent of
the new cooler rings as IUCF, CELSIUS and COSY the field is entering a new

well defined combination of initial and exit channels. Deviations from

requires specific assumptions regarding the errors in the hadronic light by
light (LbL) correction and in the hadronic vacuum polarization correction.
Under the assumption that the analysis on LbL correction of Knecht and Nyffeler
and the revised analysis of Hayakawa and Kinoshita are valid the new BNL result
implies a deviation between experiment and the standard model of 1.6 sigma -2.6
sigma depending on the estimate of the hadronic vacuum polarization correction.
We revisit the g_mu - 2 constraint for mSUGRA and its implications for the

collisions at AGS energies (2 -- 8 A cdot GeV) in a microscopic relativistic
transport model that includes all baryon resonances up to a mass of 2 GeV as
well as string degrees of freedom for the higher hadronic excitations. In order
to explore the sensitivity of the various differential flows to the nuclear
equation of state (EoS) we use three different parameterizations of the scalar-
and vector mean-fields, i.e. NL2 (soft), NL23 (medium) and NL3 (hard), with
their momentum dependence fitted to the experimental Schrodinger equivalent
potential (at normal nuclear matter density rho_0) up to kinetic energies of 1
GeV. We calculate the excitation function of sideward and elliptic flow within
these parameter sets for Au+Au collisions and compare with the recent data from
the E895 Collaboration as a function of rapidity, impact parameter and
transverse momentum, respectively. We find that the best description of the
differential data is provided by a rather 'stiff' EoS at 2 A cdot GeV (NL3)
while at higher bombarding energies (4--8 A cdot GeV) a 'medium' EoS leads to
the lowest chi^2 with respect to the data. However, the differences in the
transverse and elliptic flows (from the different parameter sets) become of
minor significance at 4--8 A cdot GeV. We attribute this insensitivity to a
similar reduction of the vector potential in all models and to the dominance of
string degrees of freedom at these bombarding energies.

  over sounding runs","17 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.plasm-ph physics.ao-ph",,"  This paper offers a model for incoherent scatter signal spectra without
averaging the received signal over sounding runs (realizations). The model is
based on the existent theory of radio waves single scattering from the medium
dielectric permittivity irregularities, and on the existing kinetic theory of
the plasma thermal irregularities. The proposed model is obtained for the case
of monostatic sounding. The model shows that the main contribution to the
received signal is made by ion-acoustic waves caused by certain spatial
harmonics of the ions number phase density. The model explains the width and
form of the signal spectrum by macroscopic characteristics of the medium, and
its fine 'peaked' structure by characteristics of the ions number phase
density. The notion of the weight volume is introduced to define the domain of
wave vectors and velocities in the spatial spectrum of the ions number phase
density which makes the main contribution to the formation of the scattered
signal. This weight volume depends on the antenna pattern, the form of the
sounding signal, and on the time window of spectral processing, as well as on
ionospheric plasma macroscopic parameters: electron and ion temperatures, ion
composition, and the drift velocity. Within the context of additional
assumption about the ions number phase density, the proposed model was tested
by the data from the Irkutsk incoherent scatter radar. The test showed a good
fit of the model to experiment.

what kind of transport is modelled. ExB turbulence under drift ordering has

magnetic flux diffusion if it is electrostatic. The ExB velocity is also
related to the Poynting energy flux. Under quasineutral dynamics, electric
fields are not caused by transport of electric charge but by the requirement
that the total current is divergence free. Consequences for well constructed
computational transport models are discussed in the context of a general mean
field analysis, which also yields several anomalous transfer mechanisms not

superluminal signals, and 3) the theory becomes logically inconsistent. If such
a theory admits autonomous evolving states, the space-like collapse must be
instantaneous. Time-like separation does not allow such conclusions. We also

  Processing","Quantum Info. Proc. vol. 1, no. 5, Oct. 2002, pp. 397-408",,,"quant-ph",,"  In a previous study (quant-ph/9911058), several remarkably simple exact
results were found, in certain specialized m-dimensional scenarios (m<5), for
the a priori probability that a pair of qubits is unentangled/separable. The
measure used was the volume element of the Bures metric (identically one-fourth
the statistical distinguishability [SD] metric). Here, making use of a
newly-developed (Euler angle) parameterization of the 4 x 4 density matrices
(math-ph/0202002), we extend the analysis to the complete 15-dimensional convex
set (C) of arbitrarily paired qubits -- the total SD volume of which is known
to be \pi^8 / 1680 = \pi^8 / (2^4 3 5 7) = 5.64794. Using advanced quasi-Monte
Carlo procedures (scrambled Halton sequences) for numerical integration in this
high-dimensional space, we approximately (5.64851) reproduce that value, while
obtaining an estimate of .416302 for the SD volume of separable states. We
conjecture that this is but an approximation to \pi^6 /2310 = \pi^6 / (2 3 5 7
11) = .416186. The ratio of the two volumes, 8 / (11 \pi^2) = .0736881, would
then constitute the exact Bures/SD probability of separability. The SD area of
the 14-dimensional boundary of C is 142 \pi^7 / 12285 = 142 \pi^7 /(3^3 5 7 13)

consistency criterion for histories of quantum events. It is shown that
``strange'' weak values for projection operators (such as values less than
zero) always correspond to inconsistent families of histories. It is argued
that using the ABL rule to obtain probabilities for counterfactual measurements
corresponding to those strange weak values gives inconsistent results. This
problem is shown to be remedied by using the conditional weight, or
pseudo-probability, obtained from the multiple-time application of Luders'
Rule. It is argued that an assumption of reverse causality (a form of time
symmetry) implies that weak values obtain, in a restricted sense, at the time
of the weak measurement as well as at the time of post-selection. Finally, it
is argued that weak values are more appropriately characterised as
multiple-time amplitudes than expectation values, and as such can have little
to say about counterfactual questions.

interaction of the anomalous magnetic dipole moment (MDM) with certain
configurations of electric field. Naively one would not expect an AC effect for
a scalar particle for which no anomalous MDM can be defined in the usual sense.
In this letter we study the AC effect in supersymmetric systems. In this
framework there is the possibility of deducing the AC effect of a scalar
particle from the corresponding effect for a spinor particle. In 3+1 dimensions
such a connection is not possible because the anomalous MDM is zero if
supersymmetry is an exact symmetry. However, in 2+1 dimensions it is possible
to have an anomalous MDM even with exact supersymmetry.
  Having demonstrated the relationship between the spinor and the scalar MDM,
we proceed to show that the scalar AC effect is uniquely defined. We then
compute the anomalous MDM at the one loop level, showing how the scalar form
arises in 2+1 dimensions from the coupling of the scalar to spinors. This model
shows how an AC effect for a scalar can be generated for non-supersymmetric
theories, and we construct such a model to illustrate the mechanism.
