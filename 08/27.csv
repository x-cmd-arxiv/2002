accretion disk launching trans-Alfvenic jets. These simulations, performed in a
2.5 dimensional time-dependent polytropic resistive MHD framework, model a
resistive accretion disk threaded by an initial vertical magnetic field. The
resistivity is only important inside the disk, and is prescribed as eta =
alpha_m V_AH exp(-2Z^2/H^2), where V_A stands for Alfven speed, H is the disk
scale height and the coefficient alpha_m is smaller than unity. By performing
the simulations over several tens of dynamical disk timescales, we show that
the launching of a collimated outflow occurs self-consistently and the ejection
of matter is continuous and quasi-stationary. These are the first ever
simulations of resistive accretion disks launching non-transient ideal MHD
jets. Roughly 15% of accreted mass is persistently ejected. This outflow is
safely characterized as a jet since the flow becomes super-fastmagnetosonic,
well-collimated and reaches a quasi-stationary state. We present a complete
illustration and explanation of the `accretion-ejection' mechanism that leads
to jet formation from a magnetized accretion disk. In particular, the magnetic
torque inside the disk brakes the matter azimuthally and allows for accretion,
while it is responsible for an effective magneto-centrifugal acceleration in
the jet. As such, the magnetic field channels the disk angular momentum and
powers the jet acceleration and collimation. The jet originates from the inner
disk region where equipartition between thermal and magnetic forces is
achieved. A hollow, super-fastmagnetosonic shell of dense material is the
natural outcome of the inwards advection of a primordial field.

complete sample of 40 Sc galaxies within 30 Mpc that are optically classified
as star-forming objects, in order to determine whether weak AGNs might be
present. Only three nuclear radio sources were detected, in NGC 864, NGC 4123,
and NGC 4535. These galaxies have peak 6-cm radio powers of 10^{20} W/Hz at
arcsecond resolution, while upper limits of the non-detected galaxies typically
range from 10^{18.4} to 10^{20} W/Hz. The three nuclear radio sources all are
resolved and appear to have diffuse morphologies, with linear sizes of ~300 pc.
This strongly indicates that circumnuclear star formation has been detected in
these three H II galaxies. Comparison with previous 20-cm VLA results for the
detected galaxies shows that the extended nuclear radio emission has a flat
spectrum in two objects, and almost certainly is generated by thermal emission
from gas ionized by young stars in the centers of those galaxies. The 6-cm
radio powers are comparable to predictions for thermal emission that are based
on the nuclear H-alpha luminosities, and imply nuclear star formation rates of
0.08-0.8 solar masses/yr, while the low-resolution NRAO VLA Sky Survey implies
galaxy-wide star formation rates of 0.3-1.0 solar masses/yr in stars above 5
solar masses. Although the presence of active nuclei powered by massive black
holes cannot be definitively ruled out, the present results suggest that they
are likely to be rare in these late-type galaxies with H II spectra.

of transitions from Fe XVIII-XXIV and Ni XIX-XX in absorption; however, the

measured the unabsorbed peak flux of 81 bursts in public data from the Rossi
X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The distribution of peak fluxes was bimodal: 66
bursts exhibited photospheric radius expansion and were distributed about a
mean bolometric flux of 9.2e-8 erg/cm^2/s, while the remaining (non-radius
expansion) bursts reached 4.5e-8 erg/cm^2/s, on average. The peak fluxes of the
radius-expansion bursts were not constant, exhibiting a standard deviation of
9.4% and a total variation of 46%. These bursts showed significant correlations
between their peak flux and the X-ray colors of the persistent emission
immediately prior to the burst. We also found evidence for quasi-periodic
variation of the peak fluxes of radius-expansion bursts, with a time scale of
approximately 40 d. The persistent flux observed with RXTE/ASM over 5.8 yr
exhibited quasi-periodic variability on a similar time scale. We suggest that
these variations may have a common origin in reflection from a warped accretion
disk. Once the systematic variation of the peak burst fluxes is subtracted, the
residual scatter is only approximately 3%, roughly consistent with the
measurement uncertainties. The narrowness of this distribution strongly
suggests that i) the radiation from the neutron star atmosphere during
radius-expansion episodes is nearly spherically symmetric, and ii) the
radius-expansion bursts reach a common peak flux which may be interpreted as a
standard candle intensity.Adopting the minimum peak flux for the
radius-expansion bursts as the Eddington flux limit, we derive a distance for
the source of 4.4-4.8 kpc.

cosmological expansion (FRW metric) with $\Lambda>0$ for a general linear

vacuum and quintessence is allowed, as well.
  Four closed-form solutions (flat universe with any $w$, and $w=1/3$, $-1/3,
-2/3$) are given, in a proper compact representation. Various estimates of the
expansion are presented in a general case when no closed-form solutions are
available. For the open universe a simple relation between solutions with
different parameters is established: it turns out that a solution with some $w$
and (properly scaled) $\Lambda$ is expressed algebraically via another solution
with special different values of these parameters.
  The expansion becomes exponential at large times, and the amplitude at the
exponent depends on the parameters. We study this dependence in detail,
deriving various representations for the amplitude in terms of integrals and
series. The closed-form solutions serve as benchmarks, and the solution
transformation property noted above serves as a useful tool. Among the results
obtained, one is that for the open universe with relatively small cosmological
constant the amplitude is independent of the equation of state. Also, estimates
of the cosmic age through the observable ratio $\Omega_\Lambda/\Omega_M$ and
parameter $w$ are given; when inverted, they provide an estimate of $w$, i. e.,
the state equation, through the known $\Omega_\Lambda/\Omega_M$ and age of the

activity of its 1-Myr-old pre-main sequence population and stellar parameters.
We find that median X-ray luminosities of low mass stars (M/M_sun < 3) increase
with increasing mass and decreasing stellar age. Brown dwarfs (0.03 < M/M_sun <
0.08) follow the same trend with mass. From M~0.1 to M~0.5M_sun, median
L_X/L_bol values increase by about half an order of magnitude and then remain
constant at ~10^-3.5 for the mass range from 0.5 to 3.0 M/M_sun. In these same
two mass ranges, L_X/L_bol remains roughly constant with age, until it drops by
more than two orders of magnitudes at the epoch when ~2-4M_sun stars are
expected to become fully radiative.
  We find a dependence of L_X and L_X/L_bol on circumstellar accretion
indicators and suggest three possible hypotheses for its origin. In spite of
improved X-ray and rotational data, correlations between activity indicators
and rotation remain elusive for these stars, possibly indicating that stars for
which rotational periods have been measured have reached some saturation level.
  Our study of X-ray activity vs. stellar mass leads us to propose that the few
HRC X-ray sources not associated with any optical/infrared counterpart trace a

cataclysmic variables, and this is increasing on a 10^7 yr timescale. Its UV
spectrum shows very strong carbon depletion vs nitrogen and its secondary mass
indicates a star far from the zero-age main sequence. We show that these
properties strongly suggest that AE Aqr has descended from a supersoft X-ray
binary. We calculate the evolution of systems descending through this channel,
and show that many of them end as AM CVn systems. The short spindown timescale
of AE Aqr requires a high birthrate for such systems, implying that a
substantial fraction of cataclysmic variables must have formed in this way. A
simple estimate suggests that this fraction could be of order one-third of
current CVs. We emphasize the importance of measurements of the C/N abundance
ratio in CVs, particularly via the CIV1550 / NV1238 ratio, in determining how
large the observed fraction is.

compute the spatio-temporal stress fluctuations induced by every earthquake
precursor and estimate, through an appropriate wavelet transform, the

representative multi-particle unjamming motions. We have implemented this
algorithm and applied it to ordered lattices as well as random packings of

states at the Fermi level in the intercalated crystals. On closer examination
it has, however, turned out to be unlikely that this is the mechanism behind
the increase in Tc. An alternative explanation of the enhanced transition
temperatures assumes that the conduction electrons not only couple to the
vibrational modes of the C60-molecule, but also to the modes of the

find that, assuming the ideal bulk structure of the intercalated crystal, both
a coupling due to hybridization of the molecular levels, and a coupling via

They are the actual equilibrium field configurations. We present a topological
classification of these solutions. In contrast, previously proposed non-soliton
configurations (""isolated fluxons"", ""triangular Josephson-vortex lattices"",
etc.) are absolutely unstable and unobservable: They are nothing but saddle
points of the Gibbs free-energy functional and are not even stationary points
of the Helmholtz free-energy functional (obtained from the former by a Legendre
transformation). (Physically, non-soliton configurations violate conservation
laws for the current and the flux.) The obtained results allow us to explain
dynamic stability of vortex planes, noticed in numerical simulations, and to
provide a unified interpretation of the available experimental data. We hope
that the paper will stimulate interest in the subject of specialists in
different fields of physics and in applied mathematics.

around kinks has on equilibrium step edge fluctuations is explored using
scaling arguments and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. When mass transport is
through step edge diffusion, the time correlation function of the step
fluctuations behaves as C(t) = A(T) t^{1/4}. At low temperatures the prefactor
A(T) shows Arrhenius behavior with an activation energy (E_{det} + 3 epsilon)/4
if E_{kr} < epsilon and (E_{det} + E_{kr} + 2 epsilon)/4 if E_{kr} > epsilon,
where epsilon is the kink energy and E_{det} is the barrier for detachment of a
step adatom from a kink. We point out that the assumption of an Einstein
relation for step edge diffusion has lead to an incorrect interpretation of
step fluctuation experiments, and explain why such a relation does not hold.
The theory is applied to experimental results on Pt(111) and Cu(100).

space-time evolution of secondary electron cascades in diamond. These cascades
follow the impact of a single primary electron at energies between 0.5-12 keV,
representing the usual range for photoelectrons. The calculations describe the
secondary ionizations caused by these electrons, the three-dimensional
evolution of the electron cloud, and monitor the equivalent instantaneous
temperature of the free-electron gas as the system cools during expansion. The
dissipation of the impact energy proceeds predominantly through the production
of secondary electrons whose energies are comparable to the binding energies of
the valence (40-50 eV) and the core electrons (300 eV) in accordance with
experiments and the models of interactions. The electron cloud generated by a
12 keV electron is strongly anisotropic in the early phases of the cascade (t
<= 1 fs). At later times, the sample is dominated by low energy electrons, and
these are scattered more isotropically by atoms in the sample. The results show
that the emission of secondary electrons approaches saturation within about 100
fs, following the primary impact. At an impact energy of 12 keV, the total
number of electrons liberated in the sample is <= 400 at 1000 fs. The results
provide an understanding of ionizations by photoelectrons, and extend earlier
models on low-energy electron cascades (E=0.25 keV, [ziaja,ziaja2]) to the
higher energy regime of the photoelectrons.

belief is not justified in general. It is put to rest here in the context of
the general framework for alpha variability [J. D. Bekenstein, Phys. Rev. D 25,
1527 (1982)] in which the exponent of a scalar field plays the role of the
permittivity and inverse permeability of the vacuum. The coupling of particles
to the scalar field is necessarily such that the anomalous force acting on a
charged particle by virtue of its mass's dependence on the scalar field is
cancelled by terms modifying the usual Coulomb force. As a consequence a
particle's acceleration in external fields depends only on its charge to mass
ratio, in accordance with the principle. And the center of mass acceleration of
a composite object can be proved to be independent of the object's internal
constitution, as the weak equivalence principle requires. Likewise the widely
employed assumption that the Coulomb energy of matter is the principal source
of the scalar field proves wrong; Coulomb energy effectively cancels out in the
continuum description of the scalar field's dynamics. This cancellation
resolves a cosmological conundrum: with Coulomb energy as source of the scalar
field, the framework would predict a decrease of alpha with cosmological
expansion, whereas an increase is claimed to be observed. Because of the said
cancellation, magnetic energy of cosmological baryonic matter is the main
source of the scalar field. Consequently the expansion is accompanied by an
increase in alpha; for reasonable values of the framework's sole parameter,
this occurs at a rate consistent with the observers' claims.

an extension of the Polynomial Hybrid Monte Carlo (PHMC) algorithm to KS
fermions. The fractional power of the KS fermion operator is approximated with
a Hermitian Chebyshev polynomial, with which we can construct an algorithm for
any number of flavors. The error which arises from the approximation is
corrected by the Kennedy-Kuti noisy Metropolis test. Numerical simulations are
performed for the two-flavor case for several lattice parameters in order to
confirm the validity and the practical feasibility of the algorithm. In
particular tests on a 16^4 lattice with a quark mass corresponding to

scale physics. Thus, by exploiting the generic properties that a semiclassical
state of the compound system fermions plus gravity should have, an effective
dynamics of spin-1/2 particles is obtained within the framework of loop quantum
gravity. Namely, at length scales much larger than Planck length and below the
wave length of the fermion, the spin-1/2 dynamics in flat spacetime includes
Planck scale corrections. In particular we obtain modified dispersion relations
in vacuo for fermions. These corrections yield a time of arrival delay of the
spin 1/2 particles with respect to a light signal and, in the case of
neutrinos, a novel flavor oscillation. To detect these effects the
corresponding particles must be highly energetic and should travel long
distances. Hence Neutrino Bursts accompanying Gamma Ray Bursts or ultra high
energy cosmic rays could be considered. Remarkably, future neutrino telescopes
may be capable to test such effects. This paper provides a detailed account of
the calculations and elaborates on results previously reported in a Letter.
These are further amended by introducing a real parameter Upsilon aimed at
encoding our lack of knowledge of scaling properties of the gravitational

the propagation of ultra high energy cosmic rays. In this article we take the
loop quantum gravity approach. We shall provide some techniques to establish

field theory, and has been proposed by Brunetti, Guido and Longo and by
Schroer. It endows the single particle Hilbert space with a family of real
subspaces indexed by the space-time regions, with certain specific properties
reflecting the principles of locality and covariance. We show by construction
that such a localization structure exists also in the case of massive anyons in
d=2+1, i.e. for particles with positive mass and with arbitrary spin s in the
reals. The construction is completely intrinsic to the corresponding ray
representation of the (proper orthochronous) Poincare group. Our result is of
particular interest since there are no free fields for anyons, which would fix
a localization structure in a straightforward way. We present explicit formulas
for the real subspaces, expected to turn out useful for the construction of a
quantum field theory for anyons. In accord with well-known results, only
localization in string-like, instead of point-like or bounded, regions is
achieved. We also prove a single-particle PCT theorem, exhibiting a PCT
operator which acts geometrically correctly on the family of real subspaces.

formation time (FFT) required by the hit hadron to reach its asymptotic form is
introduced by a Feynman diagram approach and by explicitly taking into account
the dependence of the ejected nucleon on its virtuality. The approach has been
applied both at x_{Bj} ~= 1, as well as in the so called cumulative region i.e.
at x_{Bj} > 1. Numerical calculations show that the effects of the FFT almost
completely cancel the contribution from rescattering processes. In the

Image (MAXI) onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Since low energy
protons release their energy mainly at the charge transfer channel, resulting a
decrease of the charge transfer efficiency, we thus focused on the low energy
protons in our experiments. A 171 keV to 3.91 MeV proton beam was irradiated to
a given device. We measured the degradation of the charge transfer inefficiency
(CTI) as a function of incremental fluence. A 292 keV proton beam degraded the
CTI most seriously. Taking into account the proton energy dependence of the
CTI, we confirmed that the transfer channel has the lowest radiation tolerance.
We have also developed the different device architectures to reduce the
radiation damage in orbit. Among them, the ``notch'' CCD, in which the buried
channel implant concentration is increased, resulting in a deeper potential
well than outside, has three times higher radiation tolerance than that of the
normal CCD. We then estimated the charge transfer inefficiency of the CCD in
the orbit of ISS, considering the proton energy spectrum. The CTI value is
estimated to be 1.1e-5 per each transfer after two years of mission life in the
worse case analysis if the highest radiation-tolerant device is employed. This
value is well within the acceptable limit and we have confirmed the high
radiation-tolerance of CCDs for the MAXI mission.

the conditions of the KEK ATF extraction line, the intensity of SR exceeds that
