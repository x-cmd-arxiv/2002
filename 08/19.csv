millisecond pulsars are investigated. The majority of binary millisecond
pulsars are found to descend from systems in which the most massive component
undergoes a common-envelope phase prior to the supernova explosion leading to
the birth of the neutron star.
  The orbital period distribution of simulated samples of wide binary
millisecond pulsars is compared with the observed distribution of Galactic
binary millisecond pulsars for a variety of parameters describing the formation
and evolution of binaries. The distribution functions typically show a
short-period peak below 10 days and a long-period peak around 100 days. The
observed distribution is best reproduced by models with highly non-conservative
mass transfer, common-envelope efficiencies equal to or larger than unity, a
critical mass ratio for the delayed dynamical instability larger than 3, and no
or moderate supernova kicks at the birth of the neutron star. Few systems are
found with orbital periods longer than 200 days, irrespective of the accretion
efficiency of neutron stars. This occurs as a result of the upper limit on the
initial orbital periods beyond which the binary avoids the common-envelope
phase prior to the supernova explosion of the primary.

the global velocity field, the spatially extended diffuse gaseous component

rotation curve based on the heliocentric radial velocities of the global Halpha
spatial distribution. Our results for NGC 4449 show that the optical velocity
field has a decreasing value in radial velocity along the optical bar from NE
to SW. The DIG component that permeates the entire galaxy was analysed (up to a
limiting surface brightness of ~ 3.165x10^-5 ergs cm$^-2 s^-1 steradian^-1). We
find that the diffuse gas component presents peculiar kinematical features such
as abrupt velocity gradients and highly supersonic velocity dispersions
(sigma~4 times the values of the nearest HII regions) but that its kinematical
and dynamical influence is important on both global and local scales. The
optical rotation curve of this nearby irregular shows that the NE sector
rotates like a solid body (V_rot~40 km s^-1 at R=2 kpc). For the SW side, our
results are not conclusive; the behavior of the gas at those locations is
chaotic. We conclude that the origin of such complex kinematics and dynamics is
undoubtedly related to the aftermath of an interaction experienced by this
galaxy in the past (abridged).

that the subpulse drift is not aliased but directly reflects the actual motion
of the subbeams. The carousel-rotation time must then be over 200 seconds,
which is much longer than theoretically predicted.
  The drift pattern after nulls differs from the normal one, and using the
absence of aliasing we determine the underlying changes in the subbeam-carousel
geometry. We show that after nulls, the subbeam carousel is smaller, suggesting
that we look deeper in the pulsar magnetosphere than we do normally. The many
striking similarities with emission at higher frequencies, thought to be
emitted lower too, confirm this. The emission-height change as well as the
striking increase in carousel-rotation time can be explained by a post-null
decrease in the polar gap height. This offers a glimpse of the circumstances
needed to make the pulsar turn off so dramatically.

SED-type: (1) Early-type galaxies, defined as redder than a present-day

than the complex and erratic running light curves that are normally used. For
most GRBs the slope of the cumulative light curve (S) is approximately constant
over a large fraction of the burst. The bursts are modelled as relaxation
systems that continuously accumulate energy in the reservoir and
discontinuously release it. The slope is a measure of the cumulative power
output of the central engine. A plot of S versus peak flux in 64ms (P64ms)
shows a very good correlation over a wide range for both short and long GRBs.
No relationship was found between S and GRBs with known redshift. The standard
slope (S'), which is representative of the power output per unit time, is
correlated separately with P64ms for both sub-classes indicating more powerful
outbursts for the short GRBs. S' is also anticorrelated with GRB duration.
These results imply that GRBs are powered by accretion into a black hole.

Baldwin Effect is detected for almost all emission lines from OVI1034 to

higher luminosity. The slope of the Baldwin Effect also increases with the
ionization energy needed to create the individual lines. In contrast to this
general trend, the NV1240 equivalent width is nearly independent of continuum
luminosity and remains nearly constant. The overall line behaviors are
consistent with softer UV continuum shapes and perhaps increasing gas

approximately linear way with time t for most bursts. In 19 out of 398 GRBs
with T90 > 2s, the cumulative light curve was found to increase with time as
\~t^2 implying a linear increase in the running light curve. The non-linear
sections last for a substantial fraction of the GRB duration, have a large
proportion of the cumulative count and many resolved pulses that usually end
with the highest pulse in the burst. The reverse behaviour was found in 11 GRBs
where the running light curve decreased with time and some bursts are good
mirror images of the increases. These GRBs are among the spectrally hardest
bursts observed by BATSE. The most likely interpretation is that these effects
are signatures of black holes that are either being spun up or down in the
accretion process. In the spin up case, the increasing Kerr parameter of the
black hole allows additional rotational and accretion energy to become
available for extraction. The process is reversed if the black hole is spun
down by magnetic field torques. The luminosity changes in GRBs are consistent
with the predictions of the BZ process and neutrino annihilation and thus
provide the link to spinning black holes. GRBs provide a new window for
studying the general relativistic effects of Kerr black holes.

oscillating sign-changing momentum dependence of the Fourier component V(p) of
the interaction potential. The collective many-body effects of renormalization

starting from a bare Hamiltonian ${\cal H}= {\cal H}_0 +{\cal H}_1$ with an
unperturbed part ${\cal H}_0$ and a perturbation ${\cal H}_1$,we define an
effective Hamiltonian which has a band-diagonal shape with respect to the
eigenbasis of ${\cal H}_0$. This means that all transition matrix elements are
suppressed which have energy differences larger than a given cutoff $\lambda$
that is smaller than the cutoff $\Lambda$ of the original Hamiltonian. This
property resembles a recent flow equation approach on the basis of continuous
unitary transformations. For demonstration of the method we discuss an exact
solvable model, as well as the Anderson-lattice model where the well-known
quasiparticle behavior of heavy fermions is derived.

decreases exponentially as the stress increases. We also determine the
avalanche size distribution during such failure and find a power law decay. We
compare this fatigue behavior with that obtained phenomenologically for the
nucleation of Griffith cracks. Next we study numerically the fatigue behavior
of random fiber bundles having simple distributions of individual fiber
strengths, at stress less than the bundle's strength (beyond which it fails
instantly). The average failure time is again seen to decrease exponentially as
the stress increases and the avalanche size distribution shows similar power

further, that, when one ignores optical losses, a signal-recycled Sagnac

performance, for the same circulating light power, as the Michelson speed-meter
interferometer recently invented and studied by P. Purdue and the author. The
influence of optical losses is not studied, but it is plausible that they be
fairly unimportant for the Sagnac, as for other speed meters. With squeezed
vacuum (squeeze factor $e^{-2R} = 0.1$) injected into its dark port, the
recycled Sagnac can beat the SQL by a factor $ \sqrt{10} \simeq 3$ over the
frequency band $10 {\rm Hz} \alt f \alt 150 {\rm Hz}$ using the same
circulating power $I_c\sim 820$ kW as is used by the (quantum limited)

the introduction of non-perturbative effects, linked to the size of the pion,

higher-twist terms become negligible for Q^2 larger than ~2 GeV^2, that quarks

as a generating function for as positive so negative flows in the AKNS

integrable equations. In particular, it is shown that stimulated Raman
scattering equations generate the hierarchy of flows which include the
Heisenberg model equations. This observation reveals some new relationships
between known integrable equations and permits one to construct their new
physically important combinations. Reductions of the AKNS hierarchy to ones
with complex conjugate and real dependent variables are also discussed and the
corresponding generating functions of positive and negative flows are found.
