sizes and number density of galaxies across the sky. This paper advocates the
use of these effects in wide field surveys to map large-scale structure and the
profiles of galaxy and cluster sized halos. The magnitude of the size variation
as a function of angular scale is computed and the signal-to-noise is estimated
for different survey parameters. Forthcoming surveys, especially well designed
space-based imaging surveys, will have high signal-to-noise on scales of about
0.1 arcminute to several degrees. Thus the clustering of matter could be
measured on spatial scales of about 50 Kpc to 100 Mpc. The signal-to-noise is
dominated by sample variance rather than shot-noise due to the finite number
density of galaxies, hence the accuracy of the measurements will be limited
primarily by survey area, sampling strategy and possible systematics. Methods
based on magnification are compared with the use of shape distortions and the
contrasts and complementarities are discussed. Future work needed to plan
survey strategy and interpret measurements based on magnification is outlined.

gravitationally-lensed quasars, in which the quasars are selected by flux in
more than one wavelength band. To illustrate the principle, we consider the
case of two-band selection, in which the fluxes in the two bands are
uncorrelated, perfectly correlated, or correlated with scatter. For
uncorrelated fluxes, we show that the previously-held result - that the bias is
the product of the single-band biases - is generally false. We demonstrate some
important properties of the multi-band magnification bias using model
luminosity functions inspired by observed correlations among X-ray, optical,
infrared and radio fluxes of quasars. In particular, the bias need not be an
increasing function of each flux, and the bias can be extremely large for
non-linear correlations. The latter fact may account for the high lensing rates
found in some X-ray/optical and infrared/radio selected samples.

Kompaneets equation in several significant ways. By using an inverse
differential operator this equation allows treatment of problems for which the
radiation field varies rapidly on the scale of the width of the Compton kernel.
This inverse operator method describes, among other effects, the thermal
Doppler broadening of spectral lines and continuum edges, and automatically
incorporates the process of Compton heating/cooling. It is well adapted for
inclusion into a numerical iterative solution of radiative transfer problems.
The equivalent kernel of the new method is shown to be a positive function and
with reasonable accuracy near the intitial frequency, unlike the Kompaneets
kernel, which is singular and not wholly positive. It is shown that iterates of
the inverse operator kernel can be easily calculated numerically, and a simple
summation formula over these iterates is derived that can be efficiently used
to compute Comptonized spectra. It is shown that the new method can be used for

and evolution of dark matter halos that result from the gravitational
instability and fragmentation of cosmological pancakes. Such halos resemble
those formed by hierarchical clustering in a CDM universe and serve as a
convenient test-bed model for studying halo dynamics. Our halos are in
approximate virial equilibrium and roughly isothermal, as in CDM simulations.
Their density profiles agree quite well with the fit to N-body results for CDM
halos by Navarro, Frenk, & White (NFW). This test-bed model enables us to study
the evolution of individual halos. The masses of our halos evolve in three
stages: an initial collapse, continuous infall, and a final stage in which
infall tapers off as a result of finite mass supply. In the continuous infall
stage, halo mass grows at the rate expected for self-similar spherical infall,
with M(a) proportional to the scale factor a. After the end of initial collapse
at a=a_0, the concentration parameter grows linearly with a, c(a)~4a/a_0. The
virial ratio 2T/|W| just after virialization is about 1.35, as predicted by the
truncated isothermal sphere model and consistent with the value expected for a
virialized halo in which mass infall contributes an effective surface pressure.
Thereafter, the virial ratio evolves towards the value expected for an isolated
halo, 2T/|W|~1. This mass accretion history and evolution of concentration
parameter are very similar to those reported recently in N-body simulations of
CDM. We therefore conclude that the fundamental properties of halo formation
and evolution are generic to the formation of cosmological halos by
gravitational instability and are not limited to hierarchical collapse
scenarios or even to Gaussian-random-noise initial conditions.

effects of the variation in the gas velocity as a function of distance from the
midplane. It is shown that the dust component of disks accretes slower than the
gas component. At high altitude from the disk midplane, the gas rotates faster
than particles because of the inward pressure gradient force, and its drag
force causes particles to move outward in the radial direction. Viscous torque
induces the gas within a scale height from the disk midplane to flow outward,
carrying small (size < 100 micron at 10 AU) particles with it. Only particles
at intermediate altitude or with sufficiently large sizes (> 1 mm at 10 AU)
move inward. When the particles' radial velocities are averaged over the entire
vertical direction, particles have a net inward flux. At large distances from
the central star, particles migrate inward with a velocity much faster than the
gas accretion velocity. However, their inward velocity is reduced below that of
the gas in the inner regions of the disk. The rate of velocity decrease is a
function of the particles' size. While larger particles retain fast accretion
velocity until they approach closer to the star, 10 micron particles have
slower velocity than the gas in the most part of the disk (r < 100 AU). This
differential migration of particles causes the size fractionation. Dust disks
composed mostly of small particles (size < 10 micron) accrete slower than gas
disks, resulting in the increase in the dust-gas ratio during the gas accretion

  There is observational evidence for a galactic wind on much larger scales,
presumably from the same central source which produced the bipolar shell seen

nuclear explosion (1-30 x 10^55 erg) roughly 15 Myr ago. We demonstrate that an
open-ended bipolar wind (~10^55 erg), when viewed in near-field projection,
provides the most natural explanation for the observed loop structure. The
ROSAT 1.5 keV diffuse x-ray map over the inner 45 deg provides compelling
evidence for this interpretation. Since the faint bipolar emission would be
very difficult to detect beyond the Galaxy, the phenomenon of large-scale
galactic winds may be far more common than has been observed to date.

spatially diffuse manner, at least 10 Myr in the past. Within the last few
million years, new stars have been produced at an accelerating rate, almost
exclusively within a confined group of striated cloud filaments. The gas both
inside and around the filaments appears to be in force balance. Thus, the
appearance of the filaments is due to global, quasi-static contraction of the
parent cloud material. Gravity drives this contraction and shock dissipation
mediates it, but the internal motion of the gas does not appear to be
turbulent. The accelerating nature of recent star formation means that the
condensation of cloud cores is a threshold phenomenon, requiring a minimum
background density. Other, nearby cloud regions, including Lupus and
Chamaeleon, contain some locales that have attained this density, and others
that have not. In the latter, we find extensive and sometimes massive molecular
gas that is still devoid of young stars.

to account for the observed properties of the low luminosity, high temperature

Self-similar CDAFs also have steeper poloidal density gradients and
temperatures close to the virial temperature. All these characteristics make
CDAFs more capable of producing polar outflows driven by Compton heating as
compared to other classical accretion disks. We investigate the conditions for
producing such outflows in CDAFs and look for the mass accretion rate, or,
equally, the luminosity of CDAFs for which such outflows will exist. When the
electron temperature saturates around 10^11 K at the inner region, polar
outflows are probable for 8x10^-7 <~ L/L_E <~ 4x10^-5, where L_E is the

The luminosity range for which outflow solutions exist is narrower for lower

significantly reduced. In the present work we have used the latest state of the

actual solar line shape, realistic redistribution function, Doppler and
aberration effects. This work presents the methodology of the radiative
transfer code and the first results of the comparison of the model predictions
with the Pioneer 10 data. Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations were
carried out for five neutral hydrogen- plasma models and compared with Pioneer

ionization ratio is between 0.2 and 0.5 and that the VLISM neutral hydrogen
density is less than 0.25 cm^{-3}. The present calculation suggests that the
Pioneer 10 photometer derived intensities (Rayleighs) need to be increased by a
factor of 2. If this model- derived calibration is used then the difference
between Pioneer 10 and Voyager 2 intensity values is reduced to about 2.2. The

  Proceedings are available as MPE-Report 278",,,"MPE-Report 278","astro-ph",,"  We present the outline of a new model for the coherent radio emission of
pulsars that succeeds in reproducing the energetics and brightness temperatures
of the observed radio emission from the observationally deduced distances of
50-100 pulsar radii above the neutron star in a narrow region.
  The restrictions imposed by energy conservation, plasma dynamics of the
coherent radiation process and propagation effects are used to apply the action
of a plasma process like coherent inverse Compton scattering (CICS) (see
Benford, 1992). In accordance with our findings (Kunzl et al. 1998a) this
process requires Lorentz factors of about 10 which are lower than in most other
radio emission models. This implies that no significant pair production can
take place near the surface and we expect charge densities close to the
Goldreich-Julian value (Goldreich & Julian (1969)).
  To fulfill the energetic and electrodynamic constraints the model requires
constant re-acceleration in dissipation regions which can be interpreted as a
voltage drop similar to that in a resistive current circuit built of a battery,
connecting copper wires and a resistive load.
  Using the emission heights for PSR 0329+54 published by Mitra and Rankin
(2002) and the spectral data from Malofeev et al. (1994) we find that a
constant depth of the dissipation region of about 2 r_NS can account for the
observed luminosities and spectral behavior.
  The extremely high peak fluxes in the substructures of single pulses can be
explained by beaming effects as discussed in Kunzl et al. (1998b).

we compare spectral fits of the averaged pulsar wind nebulae (PWN) emission to

suggest an empirical relationship between the bulk averaged photon indices for
the PWNe and the pulsar cores; Gamma_{PWN} = 0.8 times Gamma_{Core} + 0.8. The
photon indices of PWNe are found to fall in the range of 1.3 < Gamma_{PWN} <

radiation is interpreted in terms of inverse Compton scattering on nonlinear
density fluctuations. CICS is the longitudinal version of a laboratory free

nature involving extremely high energy densities. Moreover, it is out of
equilibrium on a fastly expanding dynamical geometry. We complement here the
1999 Chalonge Lectures on out of equilibrium fields in self-consistent
inflationary dynamics [astro-ph/0006446] investigating inflation driven by the
evolution of highly excited quantum states. These states are characterized by a
non-perturbatively large number of quanta in a band of momenta and with zero or
nonzero expectation value of the inflaton scalar field. They represent the
situation in which initially a non-perturbatively large energy density is
localized in a band of high energy quantum modes and are coined tsunami-waves.
The self- consistent evolution of this quantum state and the scale factor is
studied analytically and numerically. It is shown that the time evolution of
these quantum states lead to two consecutive stages of inflation under
conditions that are the quantum analogue of slow-roll. The evolution of the
scale factor during the first stage has new features that are characteristic of
the quantum state. During this initial stage the quantum fluctuations in the
highly excited band build up an effective homogeneous condensate with a
non-perturbatively large amplitude as a consequence of the large number of
quanta.The second stage of inflation is similar to the usual classical chaotic
scenario but driven by this effective condensate.The excited quantum modes are
superhorizon in the first stage and do not affect the power spectrum of scalar
perturbations.Thus, this tsunami quantum state provides a field theoretical
justification for chaotic scenarios driven by a classical homogeneous scalar
field of large amplitude.

theoretical expression in Samadi & Goupil (2001). The result is compared with
solar seismic data. Assuming, as it is usually done, a gaussian model for the
frequency (nu) component chi_k(nu) of the model of turbulence, it is found that
the computed P(nu) is underestimated compared with the solar seismic data by a
factor ~ 2.5. A frequency analysis of the solar simulation shows that the
gaussian model indeed does not correctly model chi_k(nu) in the frequency range
where the acoustic energy injected into the solar p-modes is important (nu ~ 2
- 4 mHz). One must consider an additional non-gaussian component for chi_k(nu)
to reproduce its behavior. Computed values of P obtained with this non-gaussian
component reproduce better the solar seismic observations. This non-gaussian
component leads to a Reynolds stress contribution of the same order than the
one arising from the advection of the turbulent fluctuations of entropy by the

large spread of the UV-V color in the range 2 to 5. The spread in UV-V is
accompanied by a spread in B-V that is mainly attributed to the range of
morphological types and luminosities. A large fraction of the objects have red
colors, UV-V = 4 +-0.4, corresponding to a weak UV-upturn as observed with IUE.
If the current interpretation for the UV emission from early-type galaxies is
applicable to our sample, the PAGB (Post-Asymptotic Giant Branch) tracks are
the most common evolution path for the low-mass stars responsible for the UV
emission. A small number of very blue (UV-V < 1.4) objects have been found that
can be reasonably interpreted as harbouring some low level of star formation.
In contrast with a previous sample based on IUE observations, no correlation is
found between the UV-V color and the Mg_2 spectral line index; possible
explanations are reviewed. The potential of a more extended UV survey like
GALEX is briefly presented.

offers the possibility of qualitatively new states of matter whose nature has
yet to be fully understood. Here we have discovered how novel composite spin
degrees of freedom can emerge from frustrated interactions in the cubic spinel
ZnCr2O4. Upon cooling, groups of six spins self-organize into weakly
interacting antiferromagnetic loops whose directors, defined as the unique
direction along which the spins are aligned parallel or antiparallel, govern
all low temperature dynamics. The experimental evidence comes from a
measurement of the magnetic form factor by inelastic neutron scattering. While
the data bears no resemblance to the atomic form factor for chromium, they are
perfectly consistent with the form factor for hexagonal spin loop directors.
The hexagon directors are to a first approximation decoupled from each other

One of the promising methods to study spectral functions is the method of
equations of motion. The latter can deal systematically with the local
constraints and projected fermion operators inherent for strongly correlated
electrons. In the evaluation of the self energy the decoupling of spin and
single-particle fluctuations is performed. In an undoped antiferromagnet the
method reproduces the selfconsistent Born approximation (SCBA). For finite
doping the approximation evolves into a paramagnon contribution which retains
large incoherent contribution in the hole part. On the other hand, the
contribution of longer-range spin fluctuations is essential for the emergence
of the pseudogap. The latter shows up at low doping in the effective truncation
of the large Fermi surface, reduced electron density of states and at the same
time reduced quasiparticle density of states at the Fermi level.

the shear banding instability using a two-fluid Johnson-Segalman model. We
perform a linear stability analysis for coupled fluctuations in shear rate,
micellar strain and concentration about an initially homogeneous state. First
we calculate the ``spinodal'' onset of instability in sweeps along the
intrinsic constitutive curve. For startup ``quenches'' into the unstable
region, the instability usually occurs before the intrinsic constitutive curve
can be attained so we analyse the fluctuations with respect to the homogeneous
startup flow to find the selected length and time scales at which inhomogeneity
first emerges. In the uncoupled limit, fluctuations in shear rate and micellar
strain are independent of those in concentration, and are unstable when the
intrinsic constitutive curve has negative slope; but no length scale is
selected. When coupled to concentration, this instability is enhanced at short
length scales; a length scale is selected, as seen experimentally. The unstable
region is then broadened. Far from an underlying (zero-shear) demixing
instability, the broadening is slight and the instability is still dominated by
shear rate and micellar strain. Close to demixing, instability sets in at very
low shear rate, where it is demixing triggered by flow.

chiral symmetry restoration known from lattice simulations. The thermodynamic
potential is a function of the Polyakov loop and chiral condensate expectation
values. The gluonic sector uses a successful model for pure (SU(N_c)) gauge
theories in which the Polyakov loop eigenvalues are the fundamental order
parameters for deconfinement. The quark sector is given by a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
model in which a constant background (A_0) field couples the chiral condensate
to the Polyakov loop. We consider the case of (N_f = 2) in detail. For two
massless quarks, we find a second order chiral phase transition. Confinement
effects push the transition to higher temperatures, but the entropy associated
with the gluonic sector acts in the opposite direction. For light mass quarks,
only a rapid crossover occurs. For sufficiently heavy quarks, a first order
deconfinement transition emerges. This simplest model has one adjustable
parameter, which can be set from the chiral transition temperature for light
quarks. It predicts all thermodynamic quantities as well as the behavior of the
chiral condensate and the Polyakov loop over a wide range of temperatures.

production resulting from spinodal instabilities during phase transitions out

drive the phase transition lead to strong non-equilibrium charge and current
fluctuations which generate electromagnetic fields. We present a formulation
based on the non-equilibrium Schwinger-Dyson equations that leads to an exact
expression for the spectrum of electromagnetic fields valid for general
theories and cosmological backgrounds and whose main ingredient is the
transverse photon polarization out of equilibrium. This formulation includes
the dissipative effects of the conductivity in the medium. As a prelude to
cosmology we study magnetogenesis in Minkowski space-time in a theory of N
charged scalar fields to lowest order in the gauge coupling and to leading
order in the large N within two scenarios of cosmological relevance. The
long-wavelength power spectrum for electric and magnetic fields at the end of
the phase transition is obtained explicitly.
  It follows that equipartition between electric and magnetic fields does not
hold out of equilibrium. In the case of a transition from a high temperature
phase, the conductivity of the medium severely hinders the generation of
magnetic fields, however the magnetic fields generated are correlated on scales
of the order of the domain size, which is much larger than the magnetic
diffusion length. Implications of the results to cosmological phase transitions
driven by spinodal unstabilities are discussed.

three-branes, originating in 11 dimensions from M five-branes, are modelled as
kink solutions of a bulk scalar field theory. It is shown that the vacua of
this defect model correspond to a class of topologically distinct M-theory
compactifications. Topology change can then be analysed by studying the time
evolution of the defect model. In the context of a four-dimensional effective
theory, we study in detail the simplest such process, that is the time
evolution of a kink and its collision with a boundary. We find that the kink is
generically absorbed by the boundary thereby changing the boundary charge. This
opens up the possibility of exploring the relation between more complicated
defect configurations and the topology of brane-world models.

  with a figure are added, submitted to Annals of Mathematics",,,,"hep-th math-ph math.GM math.MP",,"  A proof of the Riemann's hypothesis (RH) about the non-trivial zeros of the
Riemann zeta-function is presented. It is based on the construction of an
infinite family of operators D^{(k,l)} in one dimension, and their respective
eigenfunctions \psi_s (t), parameterized by continuous real indexes k and l.
Orthogonality of the eigenfunctions is connected to the zeros of the Riemann
zeta-function. Due to the fundamental Gauss-Jacobi relation and the Riemann
fundamental relation Z (s') = Z (1-s'), one can show that there is a direct
concatenation among the following symmetries, t goes to 1/t, s goes to \beta -
s (\beta a real), and s' goes to 1 - s', which establishes a one-to-one
correspondence between the label s of one orthogonal state to a unique vacuum
state, and a zero s' of the \zeta. It is shown that the RH is a direct
consequence of these symmetries, by arguing in particular that an exclusion of
a continuum of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function results in the discrete
set of the zeros located at the points s_n = 1/2 + i \lambda_n in the complex
plane.

background. In the non-rotating case they can be obtained as the limiting
geometry of dilaton black holes. The rotating solutions (possibly endowed with
a NUT parameter) are constructed using a generating technique based on the
Sp(4,R) duality of the EMDA system. In a certain limit (with no event horizon
present) our rotating solutions coincide with supersymmetric
Israel-Wilson-Perjes type dilaton-axion solutions. In presence of an event
horizon supersymmetry is broken. The temperature of the static black holes is
constant, and their mass does not depend on it, so the heat capacity is zero.
We investigate geodesics and wave propagation in these spacetimes and find
superradiance in the rotating case. Because of the non-asymptotically flat
nature of the geometry, certain modes are reflected from infinity, in
particular, all superradiant modes are confined. This leads to classical
instability of the rotating solutions. The non-rotating linear dilaton black
holes are shown to be stable under spherical perturbations.

2-body central force. The equations for the 1-body Wigner distribution
functions are written in a general manner, and the places where quantum
mechanical effects can play a role are identified. One that may not have been
considered previously concerns the momentum associated with the magnetic field
gradient, which is proportional to the time integral of the gradient. Its
relative magnitude compared with the important momenta in the problem is a
significant parameter, and if their ratio is not small some non-classical
effects contribute to the solution.
  Assuming the field gradient is sufficiently small, and a number of other
inequalities are satisfied involving the mean wavelength, range of the force,
and the mean separation between particles, we solve the integro- partial
differential equations for the Wigner functions to second order in the strength
of the gradient. When the same reasoning is applied to a different problem with
no field gradient, but having instead a gradient to the z-component of
polarization, the connection with the diffusion coefficient is established, and
we find agreement with the classical result for the rate of decrease of the
transverse component of magnetization.

overlooked the possibility of time dependence in local hidden variables, hence
the theorem has not been proven true. Moreover they present what is claimed to
be a local realistic model of the EPR correlations. If this is true then Bell's
theorem is not just unproven, but false. We refute both claims. Firstly we
explain why time is not an issue in Bell's theorem, and secondly show that
their hidden variables model violates Einstein separability. Hess and Philipp
have overlooked the freedom of the experimenter to choose settings of a
measurement apparatus at will: any setting could be in force during the same
time period.

allows one to generate free-running single photon pulses on demand. Most
properties of the emitted photons are well defined, provided spontaneous
emission processes do not contribute. Therefore, electronic excitation of the
atom must not occur, which is assured for a system adiabatically following a
dark state during the photon-generation process. We experimentally investigate
the conditions that must be met for adiabatic following in a time-of-flight
driven system, with atoms passing through a cavity and a pump beam oriented
transverse to the cavity axis. From our results, we infer the optimal intensity
and relative pump-beam position with respect to the cavity axis.

  computation","17 pages, 5 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We apply a quantum adiabatic evolution algorithm to a combinatorial
optimization problem where the cost function depends entirely on the of the
number of unit bits in a n-bit string (Hamming weight). The solution of the
optimization problem is encoded as a ground state of the problem Hamiltonian
H_p for the z-projection of a total spin-n/2. We show that tunneling barriers
for the total spin can be completely suppressed during the algorithm if the
initial Hamiltonian has its ground state extended in the space of the
z-projections of the spin. This suppression takes place even if the cost
function has deep and well separated local minima. We provide an intuitive
picture for this effect and show that it guarantees the polynomial complexity
of the algorithm in a very broad class of cost functions. We suggest a simple
example of the Hamiltonian for the adiabatic evolution: H(tau) = (1-tau) hat
S_{x}^{2} + tau H_p, with parameter tau slowly varying in time between 0 and 1.
We use WKB analysis for the large spin to estimate the minimum energy gap
between the two lowest adiabatic eigenvalues of H(tau).

successive individual photons. This single photoelectron transistor (SPT)
operating at the lambda = 1.3 mu m tele-communication band, was demonstrated by
using a windowed-gate double-quantum-well InGaAs/InAlAs/InP heterostructure

engineering allows selection rules that would convert a photon's polarization
