programme of upgrades aimed at improving its intrinsic optical performance.
This resulted in images with a FWHM of 0.""17 at 2.2 um in September 1998. To
understand and maintain the improvements to the delivered image quality since
the completion of the upgrades programme, we have regularly monitored the
overall atmospheric seeing, as measured by radial displacements of subaperture
images (i.e. seeing-generated focus fluctuations), and the delivered image
diameters. The latter have been measured and recorded automatically since the
beginning of 2001 whenever the facility imager UFTI (UKIRT Fast Track Imager)
has been in use.
  In this paper we report the results of these measurements. We investigate the
relation between the delivered image diameter and the RMS atmospheric seeing
(as measured by focus fluctuations, mentioned above). We find that the best
seeing occurs in the second half of the night, generally after 2am HST and that
the best seeing occurs in the summer between the months of July and September.
We also find that the relationship between Zrms and delivered image diameter is
uncertain. As a result Zrms frequently predicts a larger FWHM than that
measured in the images.
  Finally, we show that there is no correlation between near-infrared seeing
measured at UKIRT and sub-mm seeing measured at the Caltech Submillimetre
Observatory (CSO).

inefficiently-radiating accretion flow in a global magnetic field are examined,
based on the analytic solution obtained recently by one of the present authors.
The results exhibit the steepening of the negative slope appearing in the
intermediate frequency range of bremsstrahlung spectrum and the decrease in the
luminosity ratio of thermal synchrotron to bremsstrahlung, in accordance with
the increasing wind strength. Both effects are due to a suppressed mass
accretion rate in the inner disk, caused by a mass loss in terms of wind.
  In order to demonstrate the reliability of this model, Sagittarius A^* (Sgr
A^*) and the nucleus of M 31, both of which have been resolved in an X-ray band
by Chandra, are taken up as the best candidates for the broadband spectral
fittings. Although the observed X-ray data are reproduced for these objects by
both of the inverse-Compton and the bremsstrahlung fittings, some evidence of
preference for the latter are recognized. The wind effects are clearly seen in
the latter fitting case, in which we can conclude that a widely extending
accretion disk is present in each nucleus, with no or only weak wind in Sgr A^*
and with a considerably strong wind in the nuclear region of M 31. Especially
in Sgr A^*, the inferred mass accretion rates are much smaller than the Bondi
rate whose estimate has become reliable due to Chandra. This fact strongly
suggests that the accretion in this object does not proceed like Bondi's
prediction, though its extent almost reaches the Bondi radius.

simulations. It has been long believed that the orbit suffers circularization
due to the dynamical friction from the galactic halo during orbital decay. This
circularization was confirmed by numerous simulations where dynamical friction
is added as external force. However, some of the resent N-body simulations
demonstrated that circularization is much slower than expected from approximate
calculations. We found that the dominant reason for this discrepancy is the
assumption that Coulomb logarithm log Lambda is constant, which has been used
in practically all recent calculations. Since the size of the satellite is
relatively large, accurate determination of the outer cutoff radius is crucial
to obtain good estimate for the dynamical friction. An excellent agreement
between $N$-body simulations and approximate calculations was observed when the
outer cutoff radius is taken to be the distance of the satellite to the center
of the galaxy. When satellite is at the perigalacticon, the distance to the
center is smaller and therefore log Lambda becomes smaller. As a result, the
dynamical friction becomes less effective.
  We apply our result to the Large Magellanic Cloud. We found that the expected
lifetime of the LMC is twice as long as that would be predicted with previous
calculations. Previous study predicts that the LMC will merge into the Milky
Way after 7 G years, while we found that the merging will take place after 14 G
years from now. Our result suggests that generally satellites formed around a
galaxy have longer lifetime than previous estimates.

massive X-ray binaries in the Galaxy, are composed of Be stars and neutron
stars (X-ray pulsars) on wide (orbital periods 17-263 d), usually eccentric
(eccentricities 0.1-0.9) orbits. The systems contain two quasi-Keplerian (ratio
of radial to orbital velocity components less than 0.01) discs: decretion disc
around Be star and accretion disc around neutron star. Both discs are
temporary: decretion disc disperses and refills on time scales of years
(dynamical evolution of the disc, formerly known as the ""activity of a Be
star""), while accretion disc disperses and refills on time scales of weeks to
months (which is related to the orbital motion on an eccentric orbit and, on
some occasions, also to the major instabilities of the other disc). Accretion
disc might be absent over a longer period of time (years), if the other disc is
very weak or absent. The X-ray emission of Be/X-ray binaries has distinctly
transient nature and is controlled by the centrifugal gate mechanism, which, in
turn, is operated both by the periastron passages (Type I bursts) and by the
dynamical evolution of the decretion disc (both types of bursts). The X-ray
pulsars in these systems rotate at equilibrium periods (with the possible
exception of the slowest pulsars). Be/X-ray binaries are excellent laboratories
for investigation of both the evolutionary processes in the two discs and of
the evolution of the neutron star rotation.

risk averse i.e. unwilling to participate and rather rely on small but fixed
earnings. This results in a rock-scissors-paper type cyclic dominance of the
three strategies. The players are located either on square lattices or random
regular graphs with the same connectivity. Occasionally, every player
reassesses its strategy by sampling the payoffs in its neighborhood. The loner
strategy efficiently prevents successful spreading of selfish, defective
behavior and avoids deadlocks in states of mutual defection. On square
lattices, Monte Carlo simulations reveal self-organizing patterns driven by the
cyclic dominance, whereas on random regular graphs different types of
oscillatory behavior are observed: the temptation to defect determines whether
damped, periodic or increasing oscillations occur. These results are compared
to predictions by pair approximation. Although pair approximation is incapable
of distinguishing the two scenarios because of the equal connectivity, the

powers of a small variable is addressed by deriving a novel type of
approximants. The derivation is based on the self-similar approximation theory,
which presents the passage from one approximant to another as the motion
realized by a dynamical system with the property of group self-similarity. The
derived approximants, because of their form, are named the self-similar factor
approximants. These complement the obtained earlier self-similar exponential
approximants and self-similar root approximants. The specific feature of the
self-similar factor approximants is that their control functions, providing
convergence of the computational algorithm, are completely defined from the
accuracy-through-order conditions. These approximants contain the Pade
approximants as a particular case, and in some limit they can be reduced to the
self-similar exponential approximants previously introduced by two of us. It is
proved that the self-similar factor approximants are able to reproduce exactly
a wide class of functions which include a variety of transcendental functions.
For other functions, not pertaining to this exactly reproducible class, the
factor approximants provide very accurate approximations, whose accuracy
surpasses significantly that of the most accurate Pade approximants. This is
illustrated by a number of examples showing the generality and accuracy of the
factor approximants even when conventional techniques meet serious
difficulties.

point of view the understanding of the mechanism generating chaos is essential,

tools of chaos theory in our study, the main characteristics of chaotic
dynamics are revealed. The dynamics of packet loss events is studied by a
simple symbolic description. The cellular structure of the phase space of
congestion windows is shown. This implies periodic behavior for large time
scales. Chaotic behavior in short time scales and periodicity for larger times
makes it necessary to develop models that account for both. Thus a simple model
that describes the congestion window dynamics according to fluid equations, but
handles the packet loss events separately is introduced. This model can
reproduce the basic features observed in realistic packet level simulations.

provide explainable and statistically valid design conclusions. The research
issue is to define statistically meaningful aggregation of data in a manner

symmetric spacetime, without any reference to the field equations and just
assuming that the light ray follows the geodesics equation. We prove that the

parameter is reached. We apply this general formalism to Schwarzschild,

bundles themselves and to then explore the natural geometry of the extensions.

background current with a periodic component. The tracer dynamics is found to
be typically chaotic in a mixing region and regular in far upstream and
downstream regions of the flow. Chaotic advection of tracers is proven to be of
a homoclinic nature with transversal intersections of stable and unstable
manifolds of the saddle point. In spite of simplicity of the flow, chaotic
trajectories are very complicated alternatively sticking nearby boundaries of
the vortex core and islands of regular motion and wandering in the mixing
region. The boundaries act as dynamical traps for advected particles with a
broad distribution of trapping times. This implies the appearance of
fractal-like scattering function: dependence of the trapping time on initial
positions of the tracers. It is confirmed numerically by computing a trapping
map and trapping time distribution which is found to be initially Poissonian
with a crossover to a power law at the PDF tail. The mechanism of generating
the fractal is shown to resemble that of the Cantor set with the Hausdorff

dynamical system is chaotic or nonchaotic. (This is an alternative to the usual
approach of computing the largest Lyapunov exponent.) Our method is a 0-1 test
for chaos (the output is a 0 signifying nonchaotic or a 1 signifying chaotic)
and is independent of the dimension of the dynamical system. Moreover, the
underlying equations need not be known. The test works equally well for
continuous and discrete time. We give examples for an ordinary differential
equation, a partial differential equation and for a map.

correlations which are of genuine classical origin, and which appear in the
spectra of actions of the classical periodic orbits of the corresponding
classical systems. We review this duality and the semiclassical theory which
brings it about. The conjecture that the quantum spectral statistics are
described in terms of Random Matrix Theory, leads to the proposition that the
classical two-point correlation function is given also in terms of a universal
function. We study in detail the spectrum of actions of the Baker map, and use
it to illustrate the steps needed to reveal the classical correlations, their
origin and their relation to symbolic dynamics.

low background gas pressure p < 5 10^-11 mbar and low relative excitation to

have to be included in the lifetime extrapolation. Together with a careful
analysis of residual loss mechanisms in the MOT a lifetime determination to

interpretive implication: the Universe must have an irreducible fundamental
level, which determines the properties of matter at higher levels of
organization. We show that the main parameters of any fundamental model must be
theory-independent. They cannot be predicted, because they cannot have internal
causes. However, it is possible to describe them in the language of classical
mechanics. We invoke philosophical reasons in favor of a specific model, which
treats particles as sources of real waves. Experimental considerations for
gravitational, electromagnetic, and quantum phenomena are outlined.

denote by j the total angular momentum of the corresponding two-particle system

  In two spatial dimensions, the spin statistics connection holds if and only

the analogous relation cannot hold as it stands, but restricting it to an
appropriately chosen subspace of the state space yields a sufficient and

states it is shown that the rate can be improved such that it approaches the
