number of groups. Automated classification and parameterization work best when
applied to a homogeneous data set, and thus these techniques primarily have
been developed for and applied to large surveys. While most ongoing large
spectroscopic surveys target extragalactic objects, many stellar spectra have
been and will be obtained. We briefly summarize past work on automated
classification and parameterization, with emphasis on the work done in our
group. Accurate automated classification in the spectral type domain and
parameterization in the temperature domain have been relatively easy. Automated
parameterization in the metallicity domain, formally outside the MK system, has
also been effective. Due to the subtle effects on the spectrum, automated
classification in the luminosity domain has been somewhat more difficult, but
still successful. In order to extend the use of automated techniques beyond a
few surveys, we present our current efforts at building a web-based automated
stellar spectroscopic classification and parameterization machine. Our proposed
machinery would provide users with MK classifications as well as the
astrophysical parameters of effective temperature, surface gravity, mean
abundance, abundance anomalies, and microturbulence.

nature and hence the signature of a hot ISM in both galaxies. However, the
diffuse component accounts for only ~ 10% of the total X-ray luminosity of the
system (2 x 10^40 erg/s, 0.5 - 8 keV), which arises predominantly in a handful
of the brightest discrete sources. This diffuse emission fraction is unusually
low for a galaxy pair that has many characteristics that would lead it to be
classified as a starburst system, possibly as a consequence of the small
gravitational potential well of the system. The discrete source population, on
the other hand, is similar to that observed in other starburst systems,
possessing a flat luminosity function slope of ~ -0.6 and a total of six
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX). Five of the ULX are identified as probable
black hole X-ray binary systems, and the sixth (which is coincident with a
radio continuum source) is identified as an X-ray luminous supernova remnant.
The ULX all lie in star-formation regions, providing further evidence of the
link between the ULX phenomenon and active star formation. Importantly, this
shows that even in star forming regions, the ULX population is dominated by
accreting systems. We discuss the implications of this work for physical models

two quasars (3C263 and 3C351) and one radio galaxy (3C330). X-ray emission from

source.
  We model the hotspots' synchrotron spectra using VLA, BIMA and HST data. In
3C263 and 3C330, the hotspots' X-ray emission is at a level consistent with
being synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission, with a hotspot magnetic field
close to the equipartition value. In the two hotspots of 3C351, however, an SSC
origin for the X-rays would require the magnetic field strength to be an order
of magnitude below the equipartition value in our models: in addition, there
are offsets between the radio, optical and X-ray emission from the secondary
hotspot which are hard to explain in a simple SSC model. We discuss the
emission mechanisms that may be responsible for these observations.
  On our preferred model, the X-ray emission from the radio lobes of the three
sources is due to inverse-Compton scattering of the microwave background
radiation. If this is the case, the magnetic field strengths in the lobes are
typically about a factor 2 below the equipartition values, assuming uniform
lobe electron and magnetic field distributions.
  We detect extended X-ray emission, which we attribute to a cluster/group
environment, around 3C263 and 3C330. This detection allows us to show that the
lobes are close to pressure balance with their surroundings, as long as no
non-radiating particles contribute to the internal pressure of the lobes.

numerically at zero temperature, using samples up to size $64^4$, to test

thermodynamic limit. As the magnetization exponent $\beta$ is more easily
distinguishable from zero in four dimensions than in three dimensions, these
results provide a useful test of conventional scaling theories. Results are
presented for the critical behavior of the heat capacity, magnetization, and
stiffness. The fractal dimensions of the domain walls at criticality are
estimated. A notable difference from three dimensions is the structure of the
spin domains: frozen spins of both signs percolate at a disorder magnitude less
than the value at the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition. Hence, in the
vicinity of the transition, there are two percolating clusters of opposite
spins that are fixed under any boundary conditions. This structure changes the
interpretation of the domain walls for the four dimensional case. The scaling
of the effect of boundary conditions on the interior spin configuration is
found to be consistent with the domain wall dimension. There is no evidence of
a glassy phase: there appears to be a single transition from two ferromagnetic
states to a single paramagnetic state, as in three dimensions. The slowing down
of the ground state algorithm is also used to study this model and the links
between combinatorial optimization and critical behavior.

the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of individual or small numbers of
molecules. Our purpose in this chapter is to provide an intuitive explanation
for the observed I-V characteristics using simple models to illustrate the
basic physics. In contrast to the MOSFET, whose I-V is largely dominated by
classical electrostatics, the I-V characteristics of molecules is determined by
a more interesting interplay between nineteenth century physics
(electrostatics) and twentieth century physics (quantum transport) and it is
important to do justice to both aspects.
  We start with a qualitative discussion of the main factors affecting the I-V
characteristics of molecular conductors, using a simple toy model to illustrate
their role. Including the effects of: (1) Shift in the energy level due to
charging effects and (2) broadening of the energy levels due to the coupling to
the two contacts we obtain realistic I-V plots, even though the toy model
assumes that conduction takes place independently through individual molecular
levels. In general, however, the full non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)
formalism is needed. Here, we describe the NEGF formalism as a generalized
version of the one-level model. This formalism provides a convenient framework
for describing quantum transport and can be used in conjunction with ab initio
or semi-empirical Hamiltonians. A simple semi-empirical model for a gold wire
serves to illustrate the full NEGF formalism. This example is particularly
instructive because it shows the lowest possible ""Resistance of a 'Molecule'""
per channel.

relatively large number of long rods in the system strongly influences the
phase behaviour: the isotropic cloud curve, which defines the where a nematic
phase first occurs as density is increased, exhibits a kink; at this point the
properties of the coexisting nematic shadow phase change discontinuously. A
narrow three-phase isotropic-nematic-nematic coexistence region exists near the
kink in the cloud curve, even though the length distribution is unimodal. A
theoretical derivation of the isotropic cloud curve and nematic shadow curve,
in the limit of large cutoff, is also given. The two curves are shown to
collapse onto each other in the limit. The coexisting isotropic and nematic
phases are essentially identical, the only difference being that the nematic

characteristic of electron flow through individual modes of the QPC, as well as
well-defined branches at longer distances. The addition of a prism formed by a
triangular gate bends electron paths as the electron density is reduced under
the prism by an applied gate voltage. Under the conditions of the experiment,
electron-electron scattering is the dominant inelastic process. By observing
how the amplitude of backscattered electrons in images of electron flow
decreases with added electron energy, we are able to determine the average
length and time necessary for inelastic scattering. A dc voltage Vo applied
across the QPC accelerates electrons so that their energy is greater than the
Fermi energy before inelastic scattering occurs. The signal is observed to
decrease in amplitude and eventually disappear at distances from the QPC that
decrease progressively as Vo is increased.

  Are there experimental consequences, e.g., superconducting transducers
  between electromagnetic and gravitational radiation?","54 pages, 4 figures, Wheeler Symposium/Chapter",,,,"gr-qc",,"  One of the conceptual tensions between quantum mechanics (QM) and general
relativity (GR) arises from the clash between the spatial nonseparability of
entangled states in QM, and the complete spatial separability of all physical
systems in GR, i.e., between the nonlocality implied by the superposition
principle, and the locality implied by the equivalence principle. Experimental
consequences of this conceptual tension will be explored for macroscopically
coherent quantum fluids, such as superconductors, superfluids, and atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), subjected to tidal and Lense-Thirring fields
arising from gravitational radiation. A Meissner-like effect is predicted, in
which the Lense-Thirring field is expelled from the bulk of a quantum fluid.
Superconductors are predicted to be macroscopic quantum gravitational antennas
and transducers, which can directly convert upon reflection a beam of
quadrupolar electromagnetic radiation into gravitational radiation, and vice
versa, and thus serve as both sources and receivers of gravitational waves. An
estimate of the transducer conversion efficiency on the order of unity comes
out of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for an extreme type II, dissipationless
superconductor with minimal coupling to weak gravitational and electromagnetic
radiation fields, whose frequency is smaller than the BCS gap frequency, thus
satisfying the quantum adiabatic theorem. The concept of ``the impedance of
free space for gravitational plane waves'' is introduced, and leads to a
natural impedance-matching process, in which the two kinds of radiation fields
are impedance-matched to each other around a hundred coherence lengths beneath
the surface of the superconductor. A simple, Hertz-like experiment has been
performed to test these ideas, and preliminary results will be reported.

theory, it may be properly said that supersymmetry does not improve ultraviolet
properties but rather it is well accommodated in theories with good ultraviolet
properties.

oscillates, only around 34% of the initial solar neutrinos arrive at the Earth
as electron neutrinos and b) the conversion is mainly into active neutrinos,
however a non e, mu, tau component is allowed: the fraction of oscillation into
non-mu-tau neutrinos is found to be cos^2(alpha) = 0.08^{+0.20}_{-0.40}. This
residual flux could include sterile neutrinos and/or the antineutrinos of the
active flavors.
  KamLAND is potentially sensitive to antineutrinos derived from solar ^8 B
neutrinos. In case of negative results, we find that KamLAND could put strict
limits on the flux of solar antineutrinos, Phi(^8 B) < 1.0 times 10^4 cm^{-2}
s^{-1}, more than one order of magnitude smaller than existing limits, and on
their appearance probability P < 0.20-0.15% (95% CL) after 1-3 years of
operation. Assuming a concrete model for antineutrino production by spin-flavor
precession, this upper bound implies an upper limit on the product of the
intrinsic neutrino magnetic moment and the value of the solar magnetic field mu
B < 10^{-21} MeV (95% CL). For B ~ 10-100 kG, we would have mu <
10^{-11}-10^{-12} mu_B (95% CL).
  In the opposite case, if spin-flavor precession is indeed at work even at a
non-leading rate, the additional flux of antineutrinos could strongly distort
the signal spectrum seen at KamLAND at energies above 4-5 MeV and their
contribution should properly be taken into account.

the corrections to the tree-level gauge couplings. As we pointed out
previously, we show that the large logarithms that appear in the AdS one-loop
calculation can be obtained within the confines of an effective field theory,
by running the Planck brane correlator from a high UV matching scale down to
the TeV scale. This result exactly reproduces our previous calculation, which
was based on AdS/CFT duality. We also calculate the effects of scalar fields
satisfying non-trivial boundary conditions (relevant for orbifold breaking of
bulk symmetries) on the running of gauge couplings.

indicates that the RR F7-brane content of the solution plays the role of
keeping the brane and the antibrane from annihilating each other completely
since the two-brane configuration structure still persists in the vanishing
inter-brane distance limit of the supergravity solution. In terms of the
stringy description, we interpret this as representing that the RR F7-brane
``delays'' the brane-antibrane annihilation process but only until this
non-supersymmetric and hence unstable F7-brane itself decays. Then next, the
behavior of the supergravity solutions representing F1-bar{F1} and NS5-bar{NS5}
again for vanishing inter-brane separation reveals that as they approach, these
``NS''-charged brane and antibrane always collide and annihilate irrespective
of the presence or the absence of the NSNS F6-brane. And we have essentially
attributed this to the absence of (open) stringy description of the instability
in the ``NS''-charged case. This interpretation may provide a resolution to the
contrasting features between the instability of ``R''-charged brane-antibrane
systems and that of `NS''-charged ones. Certainly, however, it poses another
puzzle that in the ``NS''-charged case, the quantum entity, that should take
over the semi-classical instability as the inter-brane distance gets smaller,
is missing. This is rather an embarrassing state of affair that needs to be

number of a graph. Such a lower bound was first introduced by Lov\'asz in 1978,
in his famous proof of the \emph{Kneser conjecture} via Algebraic Topology.
This conjecture stated that the \emph{Kneser graph} $\KG_{m,n}$, the graph with
all $k$-element subsets of $\{1,2,...,n\}$ as vertices and all pairs of
disjoint sets as edges, has chromatic number $n-2k+2$. Several other proofs
have since been published (by B\'ar\'any, Schrijver, Dolnikov, Sarkaria, Kriz,
Greene, and others), all of them based on some version of the Borsuk--Ulam
theorem, but otherwise quite different. Each can be extended to yield some
lower bound on the chromatic number of an arbitrary graph. (Indeed, we observe
that \emph{every} finite graph may be represented as a generalized Kneser
graph, to which the above bounds apply.)
  We show that these bounds are almost linearly ordered by strength, the
strongest one being essentially Lov\'asz' original bound in terms of a
neighborhood complex. We also present and compare various definitions of a
\emph{box complex} of a graph (developing ideas of Alon, Frankl, and Lov\'asz
and of \kriz). A suitable box complex is equivalent to Lov\'asz' complex, but
the construction is simpler and functorial, mapping graphs with homomorphisms
to $\Z_2$-spaces with $\Z_2$-maps.

there are many more edges and 2-faces than there are vertices and facets, while
complexity C(P) := (f_{03}-20)/(f_0+f_3-10) is large if every facet has many
vertices, and every vertex is in many facets. Recent results suggest that these
parameters might allow one to differentiate between the cones of f- or

objects), -- strongly regular CW 3-spheres (topological objects), -- convex

microstructure. The latter, on average, drains kinetic energy to feed the
dynamics of the microstructure. The cross-over scale between the two

C66 (2002) 044304","10.1103/PhysRevC.66.044304",,"nucl-th",,"  The isoscalar E1 and E2 resonances in the proton-rich nuclei ^{48,49}Ni and
the {f_{7/2}3^-} multiplet in ^{49}Ni have been calculated taking into account
the single-particle continuum exactly. The analogous calculations for the
mirror nuclei ^{48}Ca and ^{49}Sc are presented. The models used are the
continuum RPA for ^{48}Ni, ^{48}Ca and the Odd RPA for ^{49}Ni, ^{49}Sc, the
latter has been developed recently and describes both single-particle and
collective excitations of an odd nucleus on a common basis. In all four nuclei
we obtained a distinct splitting of the isoscalar E1 resonance into 1 h-bar
omega and 3 h-bar omega peaks at about 11 MeV and 30 MeV, respectively. The
main part of the isoscalar E1 EWSR is exhausted by the 3 h-bar omega
resonances. The 1 h-bar omega resonances exhaust about 35% of this EWSR in
^{48,49}Ni and about 22% in ^{48}Ca and ^{49}Sc. All seven {f_{7/2}3^-}
multiplet members in ^{49}Ni are calculated to be in the (6-8) MeV energy
region and have noticeable escape widths.

the beta-plane equation linearized about Rossby waves. Base flows consisting of
one to three Rossby wave are considered analytically using continued fractions
and the method of multiple scales, while base flow with more than three Rossby
waves are studied numerically. It is demonstrated that the mechanism for
instability changes from inflectional to triad resonance at an O(1) transition
Rhines number Rh, independent of the Reynolds number. For a single Rossby wave
base flow, the critical Reynolds number Re^c for instability is found in
various limits. In the limits Rh --> infinity and k --> 0, the classical value
Re^c = sqrt(2) is recovered. For Rh --> 0 and all orientations of the Rossby
wave except zonal and meridional, the base flow is unstable for all Reynolds
numbers; a zonal Rossby wave is stable, while a meridional Rossby wave has
critical Reynolds number Re^c = sqrt(2). For more isotropic base flows
consisting of many Rossby waves (up to forty), the most unstable mode is purely
zonal for 2 <= Rh < infinity and is nearly zonal for Rh = 1/2, where the
transition Rhines number is again O(1), independent of the Reynolds number and
consistent with a change in the mechanism for instability from inflectional to
triad resonance.

receptive field properties is well established. Cortical feedback to the
thalamus is, in turn, the anatomically dominant input to relay cells, yet its
influence on thalamic processing has been difficult to interpret. For an
understanding of complex sensory processing, detailed concepts of the
corticothalamic interplay need yet to be established. To study
corticogeniculate processing in a model, we draw on various physiological and
anatomical data concerning the intrinsic dynamics of geniculate relay neurons,
the cortical influence on relay modes, lagged and nonlagged neurons, and the
structure of visual cortical receptive fields. In extensive computer
simulations we elaborate the novel hypothesis that the visual cortex controls
via feedback the temporal response properties of geniculate relay cells in a
way that alters the tuning of cortical cells for speed.

requiring arbitrarily strong, impulsive control actions. This is accomplished
by designing continuous decoupling propagators according to Eulerian paths in
the decoupling group for the system. Such Eulerian decoupling schemes offer two
important advantages over their impulsive counterparts: they are able to
enforce the same dynamical symmetrization but with more realistic control
resources and, at the same time, they are intrinsically tolerant against a
large class of systematic implementation errors.

Suppose two parties choose one of M two-outcome measurements and exchange 1 bit

complete set of inequalities for the joint correlation observable for M = 3. We
find that correlations produced by quantum theory satisfy both of these sets of

quantum correlations in both of these scenarios.

distinguishability of bipartite quantum states. It is shown that the operators
to reliably distinguish states need only rounds of projective measurements and
classical comunication. We also present a necessary condition of
distinguishability of bipartite quantum states which is simple and general.
With this condition one can get many cases of indistinguishability. The
conclusions may be useful in understanding the essence of nonlocality and
calculating the distillable entanglement and the bound of distillable

reasonable physical assumptions, carrying out such measurements at
quarter-period intervals is enough to demonstrate coherent oscillations of one
or two qubits between the relevant measurement basis states. One can thus infer
from such measurements alone that an approximately equal superposition of two
measurement basis states has been created in a coherent oscillation experiment.
Similarly, one can infer that a near maximally entangled state of two qubits
has been created in an experiment involving a putative SWAP gate. These results
apply even if the relevant quantum systems are only approximate qubits. We
discuss applications to fundamental quantum physics experiments and quantum
information processing investigations.
