near the Galactic plane, using data from the 2MASS survey. The first method is
based on the isolation of the red clump giant population in the color-magnitude
diagrams and the inversion of its star counts to obtain directly the density
distribution along the line of sight. The second method fits the parameters of
a disc model to the star counts in 820 regions. Results from both independent
methods are consistent with each other. The qualitative conclusions are that
the disc is well fitted by an exponential distribution in both the
galactocentric distance and height. There is not an abrupt cut-off in the
stellar disc (at least within R<15 kpc). There is a strong flare (i.e. an
increase of scale-height towards the outer Galaxy) which begins well inside the
solar circle, and hence there is a decrease of the scale-height towards the
inner Galaxy. Another notable feature is the existence of a warp in the old
stellar population whose amplitude is coincident with the amplitude of the gas
warp.
  It is shown for low latitude stars (mean height: |z|~300 pc) in the outer
disc (galactocentric radius R>6 kpc) that: the scale-height in the solar circle
is h_z(R_sun)=3.6e-2 R_sun, the scale-length of the surface density is h_R=0.42
R_sun and the scale-length of the space density in the plane (i.e. including
the effect of the flare) is H=0.25 R_sun. The variation of the scale-height due
to the flare follows roughly a law h_z(R) =~ h_z(R_sun) exp
[(R-R_\odot)/([12-0.6R(kpc)] kpc)] (for R<~15 kpc; R_sun=7.9 kpc). The warp
moves the mean position of the disc to a height z_w=1.2e-3 R(kpc)^5.25
sin(phi+(5 deg.)) pc (for R<~13 kpc; R_sun=7.9 kpc).

decreasing the value of Ho. Finally, if the Cepheids have a metallicity

images of the young planetary nebula GL 618. This object is a compact, bipolar
nebula that is currently undergoing the transition from asymptotic giant branch
star to planetary nebula. Our images confirm the presence of at least three
highly collimated outflows emanating from the central regions of GL 618. We
also detect H-alpha emission close to the central dust lane and in an extended
scattered light halo. The three outflows are occurring simultaneously in this
object, as opposed to being the result of a precessing jet. We derive an
inclination for the brightest outflow in the East lobe of 39 degrees. This
differs from the previous estimate of 45 degrees. In addition, our results
indicate that the outflows seen in GL 618 are probably not coplanar. Line
strengths derived from the narrow-band images indicate a shock velocity in the
range of 40 - 100 km/s. Based on the shock velocity we estimate that the age of
the outflows is less than 500 years. The outflows seen in the optical images of
GL 618 are related to features seen in near-IR, CO and CS maps of this object.
This relationship indicates that the outflows are playing a major role in the
morphological evolution of this young planetary nebula, interacting with and
shaping the neutral envelope surrounding GL 618. We discuss the implications of
these jets and their interaction with the neutral envelope in the context of
current models of planetary nebula formation.

visible universe. Our approach is based on a dynamical ``Cosmological
Constant'' and the starting point is that a decaying vacuum produces matter. As
we point out, such a dynamical Lambda is not incompatible with the general
requirements of general relativity. By assuming inflation and big bang
nucleosynthesis we can solve for the present fractional densities of matter
Omega_{m,0} and vacuum Omega_{Lambda, 0} in terms of only one parameter which
we call the vacuum domination crossing redshift, z_c. We put constraints on z_c
to obtain a universe that is presently vacuum dominated and with characteristic
densities consistent with observations. The model points to the possible
existence of newly formed dark matter in the inter-cluster voids. We argue that
some of this matter could be accreting onto clusters through the latter's long
range gravitational potentials. If so, then cluster dark matter halos may not
manifest clear cut-offs in their radial density profiles. Furthermore, if a
substantial amount of this newly produced matter has already drained onto the
clusters, then the CMB power spectrum may favor lower dark matter density
values than is currently observed bound in the clusters. A final feature of our
approach relates to the combined effect of the matter production by a decaying
vacuum and the different rates at which matter and the vacuum will dilute with
the scale factor. Such combination may create conditions for a universe in
which the vacuum and matter densities dilute and evolve towards comparable
amplitudes. In this sense the model offers a natural and conceptually simple
explanation to the Coincidence Problem.

lines are typically blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity by a few
hundred km s^{-1}, and they often appear kinematically consistent with UV

complex profiles with multiple kinematic components present as well as filling
of the absorption lines by emission-line photons. A key remaining uncertainty
is the characteristic radial location of the outflowing gas; only after this
quantity is determined will it be possible to calculate reliably the amount of

subtype M0 in the NGC6522 Baade's Window clear field has been investigated to
establish some general properties of cool Bulge stars. Photometric information
has been obtained from the MACHO database to search for variability and, where
possible, to determine periods. Near- and mid-IR magnitudes have been extracted
from DENIS and ISOGAL. 46 semi-regular variables and 2 irregulars were found a
mongst the 174. Many M5 and all stars M6 or later show variation, whereas
earlier subtypes do not. The DENIS I-J and J-K_S colours and the luminosities
of the M stars increase with M sub-class. K tends to increase with log P among
M-type SR variables. Almost all the variables were detected at 7 microns during
the ISOGAL programme. Excess radiation at 15 microns, indicative of heavy mass
loss, is associated with very high luminosity and late spectral type. The limit
of sensitivity of the ISOGAL survey was such that the non-variables were not
detected. Four probable M stars not listed by Blanco (1986), two of which are
semi-regular variables, were detected by ISOGAL. In the case of doubly-periodic
SR variables, the longer periods have K mags which place them close to the D
line of Wood (2000) in a K,log P diagram. The unusual MACHO light curve of one
particular star, Blanco 26, shows the commencement of a long-period variation
with an anomalously short and sharp event and appears to rule out a pulsational
model for this phenomenon.

the X-ray source RX J0820.9+0752 and its dramatic central cluster galaxy (CCG)
in the optical and X-ray wavebands.Unlike other cooling flow CCGs studied in
detail, this system does not contain a powerful radio source at its core, and
so provides us with an important example where we expect to see only the
processes directly due to the cooling flow itself. Chandra observations show
that the hot intracluster gas is cooling, dropping below 1.8 keV in the core.
Optical images (AAT and HST) show that the central galaxy is embedded in a
luminous line-emitting nebula that coincides spatially with an excess of X-ray
emission, and separate, off-nucleus clumps of blue continuum that form part of
a patchy structure arcing away from the main galaxy. The X-ray/H-Alpha feature
is reminiscent of a filament observed in A 1795 which is suggested to be a
cooling wake, produced by the motion of the CCG through the ICM. We present
optical spectra of the CCG and its surroundings, and find that the continuum
blobs show poperties clearly distinct from those of the surrounding nebula.
Accounting for the strong intrinsic reddening and its significant variation
over the extent of the line emitting region, we have fit the continuum spectra
of the blobs and the nucleus using stellar spectra. We found that continuum
emission from early main sequence stars can account for the blue excess light
in the blobs. Kinematical properties associate the gas in the system with a
nearby galaxy, suggesting some kind of tidal interaction between the two. We
suggest that the secondary galaxy has moved through the cooling wake produced
by the CCG, dragging some of the gas out of the wake and triggering the
starbursts found in the blobs.

the chemical composition is an important basic stellar parameter besides Teff,

faint galaxies. This cosmic shear signal depends upon the matter power
spectrum, thus providing a means to constrain cosmological parameters. It has
recently been proposed that intrinsic alignments arising at the epoch of galaxy
formation can also contribute significantly to the observed correlations, the
amplitude increasing with decreasing survey depth. Here we consider the
two-point shear correlation function, and demonstrate that photometric redshift
information can be used to suppress the intrinsic signal; at the same time
Poisson noise is increased, due to a decrease in the effective number of galaxy
pairs. The choice to apply such a redshift-depending weighting will depend on
the characteristics of the survey in question. In surveys with a mean z of
about 1, although the lensing signal dominates, the measurement error bars may
soon become smaller than the intrinsic alignment signal; hence, in order not to
be dominated by systematics, redshift information in cosmic shear statistics
will become a necessity. We discuss various aspects of this.

the desirable consequence of removing constraints of standard theorems about
the possibility of describing quantum theory with commutative variables.
Motivated by the formalism of consistent histories and keeping an analogy with
the theory of stochastic processes, we develop a (statistical) theory of
quantum processes. They are characterised by the introduction of a ""density
matrix"" on phase space paths -thus including phase information- and fully
reproduce quantum mechanical predictions. In this framework wecan write quantum
differential equations, that could be interpreted as referring to a single
system (in analogy to Langevin's equation). We describe a reconstruction
theorem by which a quantum process can yield the standard Hilbert space

generating a monoenergetic X-ray beam, continuously tunable from 20 - 85 KeV.
The immediate goal is the development of a Photoinjector producing 7 MeV, 0.5
nC, sub-picosecond electron bunches with normalized RMS emittances of
approximately 1 pi-mm-mR at repetition rates up to 60 Hz. This beam will then
be further accelerated to 60 MeV using a 1.05 m accelerating structure. This
Photoinjector is somewhat different than the traditional 1.5 cell design both
because of the number of cells and the symmetrically fed input coupler cell.
Its operating frequency is also unique. Since the cathode is non-removable,
cold-test tuning was somewhat more difficult than in other designs. We will
present results of ""bead-drop"" measurements used in tuning this structure.
Initial beam measurements are currently in progress and results will be
presented as well as results of RF conditioning to high gradients at X-band.
Details of the RF system, emittance-compensating solenoid, and cathode laser

bouncing universes for k=0, -1 and cyclic universe for k=1, even though it has
an exotic stiff matter from the charge Q. In this work we use the other of the

having only fermion-antifermion bound states. We support this claim by finding
distributional solutions with energies lower than the two mass treshold in the

theory to this model. We discuss some aspects of the scattering above the two

evaluated by recursive application of the product of a one-vector (span of the

and later extended by bilinearity. The Hestenesian 'dot' product, extending the
one-vector scalar product, is even worse having exceptions for scalars and the
need for applying grade operators at various times. Moreover, the multivector
grade is not a generic Clifford algebra concept. The situation becomes even
worse in geometric applications if a meet, join or contractions have to be
calculated.
  Starting from a naturally graded Grassmann Hopf gebra, we derive general
formulae for the products: meet and join, comeet and cojoin, left/right
contraction, left/right cocontraction, Clifford and co-Clifford products. All
these product formulae are valid for any grade and any inhomogeneous
multivector factors in Clifford algebras of any bilinear form, including
non-symmetric and degenerated forms. We derive the three well known Chevalley
formulae as a specialization of our approach and will display co-Chevalley
formulae. The Rota--Stein cliffordization is shown to be the generalization of
Chevalley deformation. Our product formulae are based on invariant theory and
are not tied to representations/matrices and are highly computationally
effective. The method is applicable to symplectic Clifford algebras too.

Gunning bundle descends under Frobenius when genus g is even. If g is odd, then
the Gunning bundle twisted by any odd degree line bundle also descends.

can be recovered modulo some actions of the group of projective transformations
of CP^3. For two projections, we show how in a generic situation, a
characteristic matrix of the two embeddings can be recovered. We also establish
the minimal number of irreducible algebraic curves required to compute this
characteristic matrix up to a finite-fold ambiguity, as a function of their
degree and genus. Then we use this matrix to recover the class of the couple of
maps and as a consequence to recover the curve. Then we consider another
problem. N projections, with known projections operators and N >> 1, are
considered as an input and we want to recover the curve. The recovery can be
done by linear computations in the dual space and in the Grassmannian of lines
in CP^3. A closely related question is also considered. Each point of a finite

a different point. The projections operators are known. We show when and how

the curve of minimal degree generated by the centers of projection. A second

model consisted of three modules: (1) an electron energy distribution function
(EEDF) module to compute the non-Maxwellian EEDF, (2) a non-local electron
kinetics module to predict the non-local electron conductivity, RF current,
electric field and power deposition profiles in the non-uniform plasma, and (3)
a heavy species transport module to solve for the ion density and velocity
profiles as well as the metastable density. Results using the non-local
electron conductivity model were compared with predictions of a local theory
(Ohm's law), under otherwise identical conditions. The RF current, electric
field, and power deposition profiles were very different, especially at 1 mTorr
for which the effective electron mean free path was larger than the skin depth.
However, the plasma density profiles were almost identical (within 10%) for the
same total power deposition in the plasma. This result suggests that, for
computing plasma density profiles, a local conductivity model (Ohm's law), with
much reduced computational expense, may be employed even in the non-local
regime.

Hamiltonians that one can construct to explain experimental data. One might
expect that a quantum theory based on a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian would violate
unitarity. However, if PT symmetry is not spontaneously broken, it is possible
to construct a previously unnoticed physical symmetry C of the Hamiltonian.
Using C, an inner product is constructed whose associated norm is positive
definite. This construction is completely general and works for any
PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. Observables exhibit CPT symmetry, and the dynamics is
governed by unitary time evolution. This work is not in conflict with
conventional quantum mechanics but is rather a complex generalisation of it.

general theory of such strength measures, based on axiomatic considerations

with applications to quantum communication complexity, quantum computational
complexity, and entanglement generation by unitary operations.

be remotely prepared with an Einstain-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state shared and a
cbit communication. We generalize this protocal into an arbitrary longitudinal
qubit on the Bloch sphere in which the azimuthal angle phi can be an arbitrary
value instead of only being zero. The generalized scheme was experimentally
realized using liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. Also,
we have experimentally demonstrated remote state measurement (RSM) on an
arbitary qubit proposed by Pati.

A 66, 052111 (2002)","10.1103/PhysRevA.66.052111",,"quant-ph",,"  It is known that in phase covariant quantum cloning the equatorial states on
the Bloch sphere can be cloned with a fidelity higher than the optimal bound
established for universal quantum cloning. We generalize this concept to
include other states on the Bloch sphere with a definite $z$ component of spin.
It is shown that once we know the $z$ component, we can always clone a state
with a fidelity higher than the universal value and that of equatorial states.
We also make a detailed study of the entanglement properties of the output
copies and show that the equatorial states are the only states which give rise
to separable density matrix for the outputs.

interference in the general case: $V_{i}^{2}+V_{12}^{2}\leq 1$ $(i=1$, $2)$,

$V_{i}$, two-particle interference visibility $V_{12}$ and the predication
$P_{i}$ of the path of a single particle. An equality
$V_{i}^{2}+V_{12}^{2}+P_{i}^{2}=1$ $(i=1$, $2)$ is achieved for any pure
two-particle source, which implies the condition of the complementarity
relation to reach the upper bound and its relation to another interferometric
complementarity between path information and interference visibility of a
single particle. Meanwhile, the relationships of the complementarities and the
entanglement $E$ of the composite system are also investigated. Using nuclear
magnetic resonance techniques, the two-particle interferometric complementarity
was experimentally tested with the ensemble-averaged spin states, including two
extreme cases and an intermediate case.

preparation events given a measurement event. This theory has been studied for
some time but mainly as an interesting concept associated with time asymmetry
in quantum mechanics. Recent interest in quantum communications and
cryptography, however, has provided retrodiction with a potential practical
application. For this purpose quantum retrodiction in open systems should be
more relevant than in closed systems isolated from the environment. In this
paper we study retrodiction in open systems and develop a general master
equation for the backward time evolution of the measured state, which can be
used for calculating preparation probabilities. We solve the master equation,
by way of example, for the driven two-level atom coupled to the electromagnetic
field.

perform a manifest covariant quantization and to implement initial correlations
to the solution of the Liouville-von Neumann equation. A perturbative expansion
in orders of the fine structure constant for the correlation functions as well
as the statistical operator is applied. The non-equilibrium state of the system
is given within generalized linear response theory. Expressions for the
susceptibility tensor, describing the plasma response, are calculated within
different approximations, like the RPA approximation or considering collisions
within the Born-approximation. In particular, the process of relativistic
inverse bremsstrahlung in a plasma is discussed.

of application for stochastic methods. The unraveling can be achieved by
allowing for trajectories with negative weight. We present results for the
quantum Brownian motion and the Redfield QMEs as test examples. The algorithm
can also unravel non-Markovian QMEs when they are in a time-local form like in
the time-convolutionless formalism.
