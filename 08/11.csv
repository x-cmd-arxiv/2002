since the latter is the origin of quantum effects in both Bohm and Hestenes
quantum formulisms and a fundamental quantum process associated with the
structure of space-time. Applying these ideas to the particular structures and
dynamics of the brain, we have developed a detailed model of quantum
consciousness. We have also carried out experiments from the perspective of our
theory to test the possibility of quantum-entangling the quantum entities
inside the brain with those of an external chemical substance. We found that
applying magnetic pulses to the brain when an anaesthetic was placed in between
caused the brain to feel the effect of said anaesthetic as if the test subject
had actually inhaled the same. We further found that drinking water exposed to
magnetic pulses, laser light or microwave when an anaesthetic was placed in
between also causes brain effects in various degrees. Additional experiments
indicate that the said brain effect is indeed the consequence of quantum
entanglement. Recently we have studied non-local effects in simple physics
systems. We have found that the pH value, temperature and gravity of a liquid
in the detecting reservoirs can be non-locally affected through manipulating
another liquid in a remote reservoir quantum-entangled with the former. In
particular, the pH value changes in the same direction as that being
manipulated; the temperature can change against that of local environment; and
the gravity can change against local gravity. We suggest that they are mediated
by quantum entanglement between nuclear and/or electron spins in treated liquid
and discuss the profound implications of these results. This paper now also
includes materials on further development of the theory and related topics.

"quant-ph/0208070","Grigori Amosov","L. Accardi, G.G. Amosov, U. Franz","KMS States on the Square of White Noise Algebra","14 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  It was shown in [AFS00] that there are only three types of irreducible
unitary representations theta of sl_2. Using the Schurmann triple one can
associate with each theta a number of representations of the square of white
noise (SWN) algebra A. However, in analogy with the Boson, Fermion and
q-deformed case, we expect that some interesting non irreducible
representations of sl_2 may result in GNS representations of KMS states
associated with some evolutions on A. In the present paper determine the
structure of the *--endomorphisms of the SWN algebra, induced by linear maps in
the 1--particle Hilbert algebra, we introduce the SWN analogue of the quasifree
evolutions and find the explicit form of the KMS states associated with some of
them.
