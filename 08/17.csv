the redshifts of the QSOs near NGC 1068, the remaining redshift is assumed to
be intrinsic. This well-studied case is the first example in which it has
finally been possible to separate the intrinsic redshift component from the
cosmological and other Doppler components. It is shown that this leads to
intrinsic redshift components that occur at exact multiples of z = 0.062 and
are defined by the relation zi = 0.062[10N - M] where N and M can have only
certain discrete values. It is also shown that the intrinsic redshifts given by
this relation and others obtained for different N and M-values, agree closely
with the redshifts found to be preferred in analyses of quasar emission-line
redshifts. It is now apparent that the peaks in the distribution of quasar
emission line redshifts also occur at pure harmonics of z = 0.062. Although
these peaks have previously been fitted by a log(1+z) relation, the above
explanation now seems more appropriate. These results indicate that the
Delta(z) = 0.062 redshift interval, long known to be present in QSO
emission-line redshifts below z = 0.6, is also present in an intrinsic
component of QSO redshifts up to z ~ 2. This appears to imply that the Delta(z)
= 0.062 redshift interval represents a fundamental redshift spacing that arises
from the very nature of the intrinsic redshifts.

low-extinction cavity in the densest parts of Arches (R < 5 arcsec), indicating
the depletion of dust due to stellar winds or photo-evaporation. We correct for
the change in extinction over the field and show that the slope of the mass
function is strongly influenced by the effects of differential extinction. We
obtain present-day mass function slopes of Gamma=-0.8 +- 0.2 in the mass range
6 < M < 65 Msun from both data sets. The spatial analysis reveals a steepening
of the mass function slope from close to zero in the cluster center to about
-1.7 +- 0.7 at R > 10 arcsec, in accordance with a Salpeter slope, Gamma=-1.35.
The bias in the mass function towards high-mass stars in the Arches center is a
strong indication for mass segregation. The dynamical and relaxation timescales
for Arches are estimated, and possible mass segregation effects are discussed
with respect to cluster formation models.

circumstellar (CS) gas around the intermediate mass, pre-main sequence star UX
Ori. The results are based on a set of 10 echelle spectra, monitoring the star
on time scales of months, days and hours. A large number of transient
blueshifted and redshifted absorption features are detected in the Balmer and
in many metallic lines. A multigaussian fit is applied to determine for each
transient absorption the velocity, v, dispersion velocity, Delta v, and the
parameter R, which provides a measure of the absorption strength of the CS gas.
The time evolution of those parameters is presented and discussed. A comparison
of intensity ratios among the transient absorptions suggests a solar-like
composition of the CS gas. This confirms previous results and excludes a very
metal-rich environment as the cause of the transient features in UX Ori. The
features can be grouped by their similar velocities into 24 groups, of which 17
are redshifted and 7 blueshifted. An analysis of the velocity of the groups
allows us to identify them as signatures of the dynamical evolution of 7 clumps
of gas, of which 4 represent accretion events and 3 outflow events. Most of the
events decelerate at a rate of tenths of ms-2, while 2 events accelerate at
approximately the same rate; one event is seen experiencing both an
acceleration and a deceleration phase and lasts for a period of few days. This
time scale seems to be the typical duration of outflowing and infalling events
in UX Ori. The dispersion velocity and the relative aborption strength of the
features do not show drastic changes during the lifetime of the events, which
suggests they are gaseous blobs preserving their geometrical and physical
identity.

simulations of PN formation using CS tracks for six stellar core masses

from the previous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolution is used as the
starting configuration. The formation of multiple shells is discussed in the
light of our models, and the density, velocity and halpha emission brightness
profiles are shown for each stellar mass considered. We have computed the
evolution of the different shells in terms of radius, expansion velocity, and
halpha peak emissivity. We find that the evolution of the main shell is
controlled by the ionization front rather than by the thermal pressure provided
by the hot bubble during the early PN stages. This effect explains why the
kinematical ages overestimate the age in young CSs. At later stages in the
evolution and for low mass progenitors the kinematical ages severely
underestimate the CS age. Large (up to 2.3 pc), low surface brightness shells
(less than 2000 times the brightness of the main shell) are formed in all of
our models (with the exception of the 5 Msun model). These PN halos contain
most of the ionized mass in PNe, which we find is greatly underestimated by the
observations because of the low surface brightness of the halos.

spatial resolution of ~8"". The ionized edges of this cloud forms the Arched
Filament HII regions which are ionized by the adjacent Arches stellar cluster.
The OVRO data were combined with single-dish data obtained at the 30-m IRAM
telescope by Serabyn & Guesten (1987). A comparison of this CS(2-1) data and
the H92alpha recombination line data of Lang, Goss & Morris (2001) reveals that
the ionized and molecular gas are physically related, but that their velocities
in this region differ by up to 35 km/s. This difference in velocity can be
understood if the gas that gave rise to the G0.07+0.04 HII region has been
fully ionized. An overall comparison of the molecular and ionized gas across
the entire -30 km/s cloud based on the single dish CS(2-1) data and the
H92alpha line data illustrates that such differences in velocity between the
ionized and molecular gas are common and that the geometrical arrangement of
these components is complicated. Much of the ionized gas resides on the near
side (to the observer) of the molecular cloud; however, in several regions,
some molecular material must lie in front of the HII region. The Arches stellar
cluster therefore appears to be located in the midst of the molecular clouds
such that some of the near-side cloud surfaces along our line of sight have not
been exposed to the ionizing radiation.

these lensing-SZ correlations, while kurtosis receives contributions from both
lensing alone and lensing-SZ correlations. We show that if the projected

best achieved initially with modest aperture telescopes of 3--4 m in diameter.

confined between walls at equilibrium and in a steady-state Poisseuille flow.
The walls consist of point particles forming a rigid face-centered cubic
lattice and the interaction of the walls with the melt atoms is modelled such
that the wall particles have only a weak bonding to those in the melt, i.e.
much weaker than the covalent bonding of a Si-O unit. We observe a pronounced
layering of the melt near the walls. This layering, as seen in the total
density profile, has a very irregular character which can be attributed to a
preferred orientational ordering of SiO4 tetrahedra near the wall. On
intermediate length scales, the structure of the melt at the walls can be well
distinguished from that of the bulk by means of the ring size distribution.
Whereas essentially no structural changes occur in the bulk under the influence
of the shear fields considered, strong structural rearrangements in the ring
size distribution are present at the walls as far as there is a slip motion.
For the sheared system, parabolic velocity profiles are found in the bulk
region as expected from hydrodynamics and the values for the shear viscosity as

based on designers' intuition. Such approach may be useful for average-case
analysis but does not cover boundary-point (worst or best-case) scenarios. To
synthesize boundary-point scenarios a more systematic approach is needed.In
this paper, we present a method for automatic synthesis of worst and best case
scenarios for protocol boundary-point evaluation.
  Our method uses a fault-oriented test generation (FOTG) algorithm for
searching the protocol and system state space to synthesize these scenarios.
The algorithm is based on a global finite state machine (FSM) model. We extend
the algorithm with timing semantics to handle end-to-end delays and address
performance criteria. We introduce the notion of a virtual LAN to represent
delays of the underlying multicast distribution tree. The algorithms used in
our method utilize implicit backward search using branch and bound techniques
and start from given target events. This aims to reduce the search complexity
drastically. As a case study, we use our method to evaluate variants of the
timer suppression mechanism, used in various multicast protocols, with respect
to two performance criteria: overhead of response messages and response time.
Simulation results for reliable multicast protocols show that our method
provides a scalable way for synthesizing worst-case scenarios automatically.
Results obtained using stress scenarios differ dramatically from those obtained
through average-case analyses. We hope for our method to serve as a model for
applying systematic scenario generation to other multicast protocols.

in large scale Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANets) which, may scale up to thousands
of nodes and may span wide geographical regions. Unlike previously proposed
schemes, our architecture avoids expensive mechanisms such as global flooding
as well as complex coordination between nodes to form a hierarchy. CARD is also
independent of any external source of information such as GPS. In our
architecture nodes within a limited number of hops from each node form the
neighborhood of that node. Resources within the neighborhood can be readily
accessed with the help of a proactive scheme within the neighborhood. For
accessing resources beyond the neighborhood, each node also maintains a few
distant nodes called contacts. Contacts help in creating a small world in the
network and provide an efficient way to query for resources beyond the
neighborhood. As the number of contacts of a node increases, the network view
(reachability) of the node increases. Paths to contacts are validated
periodically to adapt to mobility. We present mechanisms for contact selection
and maintenance that attempt to increase reachability while minimizing
overhead. Our simulation results show a clear trade-off between increase in
reachability on one hand, and contact selection and maintenance overhead on the
other. Our results suggest that CARD can be configured to provide a desirable
reachability distribution for different network sizes. Comparisons with other
schemes for resource discovery, such as flooding and bordercasting, show our
architecture to be much more efficient and scalable.

  (M&M)","12 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.NI",,"  One of the most important metrics in the design of IP mobility protocols is
the handover performance. The current Mobile IP (MIP) standard has been shown
to exhibit poor handover performance. Most other work attempts to modify MIP to
slightly improve its efficiency, while others propose complex techniques to
replace MIP. Rather than taking these approaches, we instead propose a new
architecture for providing efficient and smooth handover, while being able to
co-exist and inter-operate with other technologies. Specifically, we propose an
intra-domain multicast-based mobility architecture, where a visiting mobile is
assigned a multicast address to use while moving within a domain. Efficient
handover is achieved using standard multicast join/prune mechanisms. Two
approaches are proposed and contrasted. The first introduces the concept
proxy-based mobility, while the other uses algorithmic mapping to obtain the
multicast address of visiting mobiles. We show that the algorithmic mapping
approach has several advantages over the proxy approach, and provide mechanisms
to support it. Network simulation (using NS-2) is used to evaluate our scheme
and compare it to other routing-based micro-mobility schemes - CIP and HAWAII.
The proactive handover results show that both M&M and CIP shows low handoff
delay and packet reordering depth as compared to HAWAII. The reason for M&M's
comparable performance with CIP is that both use bi-cast in proactive handover.
The M&M, however, handles multiple border routers in a domain, where CIP fails.
We also provide a handover algorithm leveraging the proactive path setup
capability of M&M, which is expected to outperform CIP in case of reactive
handover.

commences its expansion from a quasi-singular state during which both the
Hubble parameter and the energy density and pressure remain finite while the

interferometric gravitational-wave detectors (e.g., LIGO-III and EURO), one
strategy is to monitor the relative momentum or speed of the test-mass mirrors,
rather than monitoring their relative position. A previous paper analyzed a
straightforward but impractical design for a {\it speed-meter interferometer}
that accomplishes this. This paper describes some practical variants of
speed-meter interferometers. Like the original interferometric speed meter,
these designs {\it in principle} can beat the gravitational-wave standard
quantum limit (SQL) by an arbitrarily large amount, over an arbitrarily wide
range of frequencies. These variants essentially consist of a Michelson
interferometer plus an extra ""sloshing"" cavity that sends the signal back into
the interferometer with opposite phase shift, thereby cancelling the position
information and leaving a net phase shift proportional to the relative
velocity. {\it In practice}, the sensitivity of these variants will be limited
by the maximum light power $W_{\rm circ}$ circulating in the arm cavities that
the mirrors can support and by the leakage of vacuum into the optical train at
dissipation points. In the absence of dissipation and with a squeezed vacuum of
power squeeze factor ~ 0.1 inserted into the output port so as to keep the
circulating power down, the SQL can be beat by a factor 10 in power at all
frequencies below some chosen $f_{\rm opt}\simeq 100$ Hz, with $W_{\rm
circ}\simeq 800$ kW. Estimates are given of the amount by which vacuum leakage
at dissipation points will debilitate this sensitivity; these losses are 10% or

large scale homogeneity and flatness as well as predicting the deviations from

can explain successfully these features of the universe. We consider anew and
modify a model in which local Lorentz invariance is spontaneously broken in the
very early universe, and in this epoch the speed of light undergoes a first or
second order phase transition to a value ~ 30 orders of magnitude smaller,
corresponding to the presently measured speed of light. Before the phase
transition at a time t ~ t_c, the entropy of the universe is reduced by many
orders of magnitude, allowing for a semiclassical quantum field theory
calculation of a scale invariant fluctuation spectrum. After the phase
transition has occurred, the radiation density and the entropy of the universe
increase hugely and the increase in the entropy follows the arrow of time
determined by the spontaneously broken direction of the vev <\phi^a>_0. This
solves the enigma of the arrow of time and the second law of thermodynamics. A
new calculation of the primordial Gaussian and adiabatic fluctuation spectrum
is carried out, leading to a scale invariant scalar component of the power
spectrum. We argue that there are several attractive features of VSL theory
compared to standard inflationary theory, and that it provides an alternative
cosmology with potentially different predictions.

black hole production, are generically determined soley by the spacetime
geometry. Dynamical scales, notably the scale of supersymmetry breaking and
moduli masses, depend on other details of the model. We illustrate these
relationships in a class of solutions of type IIB string theory with imaginary
self-dual fluxes. After identifying the geometrical scales and the resulting
hierarchy, we determine the gravitino and moduli masses through explicit
dimensional reduction, and estimate their value to be near the four-dimensional
Planck scale. In the process we obtain expressions for the superpotential and
Kahler potential, including the effects of warping. We identify matter living
on certain branes to be effectively sequestered from the supersymmetry breaking
fluxes: specifically, such ""visible sector"" fields receive no tree-level masses
from the supersymmetry breaking. However, loop corrections are expected to
generate masses, at the phenomenologically viable TeV scale.
