during a proper motion survey for cool white dwarfs based on photographic
material used for the construction of the Guide Star Catalog II. Its large
proper motion (0.48 arcsec/yr) and faint apparent magnitude (V = 18.7) suggest
a nearby object of low luminosity. A low-resolution spectrum taken with the
William Herschel Telescope clearly shows strong C2 Deslandres-d'Azambuja and
Swan bands, which identify the star as a DQ white dwarf. The strength of the
Deslandres-d'Azambuja bands and the depression of the continuum in the
Swan-band region are signs of enhanced carbon abundance for the given Teff.
Comparison of our spectrophotometric data to published synthetic spectra
suggests 6000 K < Teff < 8000 K although further analysis with specialized
synthetic models appear necessary to derive both Teff and chemical composition.
Finally, the range of spatial velocity estimated for this object makes it a
likely member of the halo or thick disk population.

out of 109 galaxies have been detected in HI. We confirm the weak trend of
increasing gas richness with decreasing luminosity found by previous authors.
Gas richness is also shown to be weakly anti-correlated with metallicity. The
dependence of star formation rates (SFRs) and HI gas depletion timescales on
metallicity is examined. The median solar metallicity based SFR and gas
depletion timescale are 0.1639 M_sun/yr and 5 Gyrs, respectively. Corrections
for variations in metallicity decreases SFRs by about 0.5 dex and increases gas
depletion timescales by an average of about 8 Gyrs. The majority of galaxies in
this sample still have large reservoirs of HI gas, and despite their large
current star formation rates, could have formed stars in a quasi-continuous
manner for a Hubble time. Finally, we present the first HI mass function for
low luminosity star-forming galaxies and show that this subpopulation
contributes 10-15% of the overall HI density in the local universe. We conclude
that if the HI mass function of the Universe does indeed have a steeply rising
low-mass slope as suggested by previous authors, it is not due to the

any axis different from principal. We discuss the internal-dissipation-caused
relaxation of a freely precessing rotator towards its minimal-energy mode (mode
that corresponds to the spin about the maximal-inertia axis). While the body
nutates at some rate, the internal stresses and strains within the body
oscillate at frequencies both higher and lower than this rate. The internal

application of our findings to asteroids. Regarding the comets, estimates show
that the currently available angular resolution of spacecraft-based instruments

month-long spans of time. We also discuss cosmic-dust astrophysics; in
particular, the role played by precession damping in the dust alignment. We
show that this damping provides coupling of the grain's rotational and
vibrational degrees of freedom; this entails occasional flipping of dust grains
due to thermal fluctuations. During such a flip, grain preserves its angular
momentum, but the direction of torques arising from H2 formation reverses. As a
result, flipping grain will not rotate fast in spite of the action of
uncompensated H2 formation torques. The grains get ``thermally trapped,'' and

members of wide binaries. Physical collisions are too infrequent to account for
their formation. Collisionless gravitational interactions are more promising.
These provide two channels for binary formation. In each, the initial step is
the formation of a transient binary when two large bodies penetrate each
other's Hill spheres. Stabilization of a transient binary requires that it lose
energy. Either dynamical friction due to small bodies or the scattering of a
third large body can be responsible. Our estimates favor the former, albeit by
a small margin. We predict that most objects of size comparable to those
currently observed in the Kuiper belt are members of multiple systems. More
specifically, we derive the probability that a large body is a member of a
binary with semi-major axis of order a. The probability depends upon sigma, the
total surface density, Sigma, the surface density of large bodies having radius
R, and theta=10^-4, the angle subtended by the solar radius as seen from the
Kuiper belt. For (sigma/Sigma)R<a< R/theta, the probability is just (Sigma/rho
R)theta^-2, the optical depth of the large bodies divided by the solid angle
subtended by the Sun. For R<a<r_u=(sigma/Sigma)R, it varies inversely with
semimajor axis and reaches (sigma/rho R)theta^-2 at a=R. Based on current
surveys of the Kuiper belt, we estimate Sigma/rho=3 10^-4cm and R=100km. We
obtain sigma/rho=0.3cm by extrapolating the surface density deduced for the
minimum mass solar nebula. Rough predictions are: outside of the critical
separation r_u/a_odot=3'', the binary probability is 0.3%; at separations of

both SQ A and SQ B, over areas of between 15 and 25 kpc. The CO clouds seem to
have otherwise different properties and may be of a different nature. The
integrated CO line of SQ A is in particular much wider than in SQ B. Its CO
spectrum shows emission at two velocities (6000 and 6700 km s^{-1}) that are
coincident with two HI lines. The strongest emission at 6000 km s^{-1} is
however spatially offset from the HI emission and situated on a ridge
south-east of the starburst region. In SQ B the CO emission coincides with that
of tracers of star formation (halpha, 15 mu m and radio continuum). The CO peak
lies slightly offset from the HI peak towards a steep HI gradient. This is
indicating that the molecular gas is forming in-situ, possibly in a region of
compressed HI, with subsequent star formation. The star forming region at SQ B

sigma Orionis. Due to its overluminous location in color-magnitude diagrams,
SOri71 might be younger than other cluster members, or a binary of similar
components. Its mass is in the range 0.021-0.012 M(sun), depending on
evolutionary models and possible binarity. The broad H(alpha) line of SOri71
appears asymmetric, indicative of high velocity mass motions in the H(alpha)
forming region. The origin of this emission is unclear at the present time. We
discuss three possible scenarios: accretion from a disk, mass exchange between
the components of a binary system, and emission from a chromosphere.

based on a weak-field deflection angle a = 2/x, where x = (r c^2)/(2 G M) with
r the distance of closest approach to the mass of a lensed light ray. It was
shown that for a point mass lens, the total magnification and image centroid
shift of a point source remain unchanged by relativistic corrections of second
order in 1/x. This paper considers these issues analytically taking into
account the relativistic images, under three standard lensing configuration
assumptions, for a Schwarzschild black hole lens with background point and
extended sources having arbitrary surface brightness profiles. We apply our
results to the Galactic black hole for lensing scenarios where our assumptions
hold. We show that a single factor characterizes the full relativistic
correction to the weak-field image centroid and magnification. As the
lens-source distance increases, the relativistic correction factor strictly
decreases. In particular, we find that for point and extended sources about 10
pc behind the black hole (which is a distance significantly outside the tidal
disruption radius of a sun-like source), the relativistic correction factor is
miniscule, of order 10^{-14}. Therefore, for standard lensing configurations,
any detectable relativistic corrections to microlensing by the Galactic black
hole will most likely have to come from sources significantly closer to the
black hole.

The collected data cover the energy range 0.1 - 10 keV (observer's frame),
reaching ~ 100 keV for one object. The BeppoSAX band in one of our sources, RGB
J1629+4008, is dominated by synchrotron emission peaking at ~ 2 x 10^16 Hz, as
also shown by its steep (energy index alpha_x ~ 1.5) spectrum. This makes this
object the FIRST known FSRQ whose X-ray emission is not due to inverse Compton
radiation. Two other sources display a flat BeppoSAX spectrum (alpha_x ~ 0.7),
with weak indications of steepening at low X-ray energies. The combination of
BeppoSAX and ROSAT observations, (non-simultaneous) multifrequency data, and a
synchrotron inverse Compton model suggest synchrotron peak frequencies ~ 10^15
Hz, although a better coverage of their spectral energy distributions is needed
to provide firmer values. If confirmed, these values would be typical of
``intermediate'' BL Lacs for which the synchrotron and inverse Compton
components overlap in the BeppoSAX band. Our sources, although firmly in the
radio-loud regime, have powers more typical of high-energy peaked BL Lacs than
of FSRQ, and indeed their radio powers put them near the low-luminosity end of
the FSRQ luminosity function. We discuss this in terms of an anti-correlation
between synchrotron peak frequency and total power, based on physical
arguments, and also as possibly due to a selection effect.

nonemissive triplet excitons. We briefly review other existing theories and
show how our approach is substantively different from these theories. Using an
exact time-dependent approach to the interchain/intermolecular charge-transfer
within a long-range interacting model we find that, (i) the relative yield of
the singlet exciton in polymers is considerably larger than the 25% predicted
from statistical considerations, (ii) the singlet exciton yield increases with
chain length in oligomers, and, (iii) in small molecules containing nitrogen
heteroatoms, the relative yield of the singlet exciton is considerably smaller
and may be even close to 25%. The above results are independent of whether or
not the bond-charge repulsion, X_perp, is included in the interchain part of
the Hamiltonian for the two-chain system. The larger (smaller) yield of the
singlet (triplet) exciton in carbon-based long-chain polymers is a consequence
of both its ionic (covalent) nature and smaller (larger) binding energy. In
nitrogen containing monomers, wavefunctions are closer to the noninteracting
limit, and this decreases (increases) the relative yield of the singlet
(triplet) exciton. Our results are in qualitative agreement with
electroluminescence experiments involving both molecular and polymeric light
emitters. The time-dependent approach developed here for describing
intermolecular charge-transfer processes is completely general and may be
applied to many other such processes.

systems involving Kondo impurities in quantum corrals assembled on Cu or noble
metal surfaces. The solution of the two-dimensional one-particle Schrodinger
equation in a hard wall corral without impurity is useful to predict the
conditions under which the Kondo effect can be projected to a remote location
(the quantum mirage). To model a soft circular corral, we solve this equation
under the potential W*delta(r-r0), where r is the distance to the center of the
corral and r0 its radius. We expand the Green's function of electron surface
states Gs0 for r<r0 as a discrete sum of contributions from single poles at

the resonance produced by the soft confining potential, and turns out to be a
simple increasing function of epsilon_i. In presence of an impurity, we solve
the Anderson model at arbitrary temperatures using the resulting expression for
Gs0 and perturbation theory up to second order in the Coulomb repulsion U. We

surfaces of microscopic dust grains, is an essential process in the evolution
of chemical complexity in interstellar clouds. The H_2 formation process has
been studied theoretically, and in recent years also by laboratory experiments.
The experimental results were analyzed using a rate equation model. The
parameters of the surface, that are relevant to H_2 formation, were obtained
and used in order to calculate the recombination rate under interstellar
conditions. However, it turned out that due to the microscopic size of the dust
grains and the low density of H atoms, the rate equations may not always apply.
A master equation approach that provides a good description of the H_2
formation process was proposed. It takes into account both the discrete nature
of the H atoms and the fluctuations in the number of atoms on a grain. In this
paper we present a comprehensive analysis of the H_2 formation process, under
steady state conditions, using an exact solution of the master equation. This
solution provides an exact result for the hydrogen recombination rate and its
dependence on the flux, the surface temperature and the grain size. The results
are compared with those obtained from the rate equations. The relevant length
scales in the problem are identified and the parameter space is divided into
two domains. One domain, characterized by first order kinetics, exhibits high
efficiency of H_2 formation. In the other domain, characterized by second order
kinetics, the efficiency of H_2 formation is low. In each of these domains we
identify the range of parameters in which, the rate equations do not account
correctly for the recombination rate. and the master equation is needed.

given. The fact that the suite started with a system in which all the dynamical
variables behave as tensors (contrary to what happens with BSSN system) allows
one to keep the same parametrization when passing from one system to the next
in the suite. The direct relationship between each parameter and a particular

initial conditions. This attractive variant of leptogenesis requires at least
one of the rhd neutrinos to have small Yukawa coupling and to have mass ~ 10^6

neutrinos are realized as bulk fields N_i with 5d bulk masses, while Yukawa
couplings and lepton-number-violating masses for the N_i are localized at the
SM boundary. The exponential suppression of the would-be N_i zero-modes leads
to the desired small 4d Yukawa couplings and small masses for the rhd neutrino
states. The see-saw prediction for the lhd neutrino mass scale is automatically
maintained. We show that this realization of rhd neutrinos is nicely
accommodated within an attractive orbifold-GUT flavour model, where all flavour
hierarchies have a geometrical origin.

Recently, a new approach is proposed, in which charm quarks are taken as heavy
quarks and the nonperturbative effect related to charmonia can be handled with
nonrelativistic QCD. The interaction between the $c\bar c$ pair and the initial
hadron is through exchange of soft gluons. The exchange of soft gluons can be
studied with heavy quark effective theory and an expansion in the inverse of
charm quark mass $m_c$ can be employed. In this approach a simple formula for
the S-matrix can be derived by neglecting higher orders in $m_c^{-1}$ and
relativistic correction related to charmonia. The S-matrix is related to the
usual gluon distribution $g(x)$ at small $x$. This result is different than
those from other approaches. Confronting experiment the result is not in
agreement with experimental measurement because large errors from higher order
in $m_c^{-1}$ and from relativistic corrections. Nevertheless the ratio of
cross sections of $\jpsi$ and $\psi(2S)$ can be predicted more precisely than
cross-sections. In this letter we show that the ratio predicted in this
approach with an estimation of relativistic corrections is in good agreement
with the recent measurement at HERA.

These terms, when defined asymptotically, behave like AdS_4 in this regime,
while when defined at infinitely short distances predict either an additional
attractive Newtonian potential or an attractive potential which scales
approximately as sqrt(r). One of the solutions found gives extra deflection of
light compared to Newtonian deflection.

experiences while synchronizing to a sequence. We also consider the
synchronization time tau, which is the average number of measurements required
to infer the phase of a periodic signal. We calculate T and tau for all
periodic sequences up to and including period 23. We show which sequences of a
given period have the maximum and minimum possible T and tau values, develop
analytic expressions for the extreme values, and show that in these cases the
transient information is the product of the total phase information and the
synchronization time. Despite the latter result, our analyses demonstrate that
the transient information and synchronization time capture different and
complementary structural properties of individual periodic sequences --
properties, moreover, that are distinct from source entropy rate and mutual

in practice: MMs are often brighter than PMs, and it is hard to combine the
pairs because their brightness often spans decades. Previous analysis suggested
these problems were sequence-related; publication of the probe sequences has
permitted us an in-depth study of this issue. Our results suggest that
fluorescently labeling the nucleotides interferes with mRNA binding, causing a
catch-22 since, to be detected, the target mRNA must both glow and stick to its
probe: without labels it cannot be seen even if bound, while with too many it
won't bind. We show that this conflict causes much of the complexity of HDONA

to a rational expectations attitude on the part of the players. However, in
many cases, games played by human players have outcomes very different from
Nash equilibria. A restricted version of quantum games is proposed to
implement, in mathematical games, the interplay of self-interest and
internalized social norms that rules human behavior.

Gen. 36, 1683 (2003)","10.1088/0305-4470/36/6/312",,"quant-ph",,"  We show that the classical mechanics of an algebraic model are implied by its
quantizations. An algebraic model is defined, and the corresponding classical
and quantum realizations are given in terms of a spectrum generating algebra.
Classical equations of motion are then obtained by constraining the quantal
dynamics of an algebraic model to an appropriate coherent state manifold. For
the cases where the coherent state manifold is not symplectic, it is shown that
there exist natural projections onto classical phase spaces. These results are
illustrated with the extended example of an asymmetric top.

into the quantum domain. This paper explores further extensions of these ideas
that may have a substantial potential for further research. Upon reformulating
quantum game theory as a theory of classical games played by ""quantum players""
I take a constructive approach. The roles of the players and the arbiter are
investigated for clues on the nature of the quantum game space.
  Upon examination of the role of the arbiter, a possible non-commutative
nature of pay-off operators can be deduced. I investigate a sub-class of games
in which the pay-off operators satisfy non-trivial commutation relations.
Non-abelian pay-off operators can be used to generate whole families of quantum
games.
