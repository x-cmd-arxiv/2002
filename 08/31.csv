by using N-body simulations. Four spherical models with realistic density
profiles are studied: one of them fits the luminosity profile of globular
clusters, while the remaining three models provide good approximations to the
surface brightness of elliptical galaxies. The phase-space distribution
function f(E) of each one of these non-rotating models satisfies the sufficient
condition for stability df/dE < 0. Different amounts of rotation are introduced
in these models by changing the sign of the z-component of the angular momentum
for a given fraction of the particles. Numerical simulations show that all
these rotating models are stable to both radial and non-radial perturbations,
irrespective of their degree of rotation. These results suggest that rotating
isotropic spherical models with realistic density profiles might generally be
stable. Furthermore, they show that spherical stellar systems can rotate very
rapidly without becoming oblate.

dynamics and thermal structure of the convective surface layers of a
prototypical late-type M-dwarf (Teff~2800K log(g)=5.0, solar chemical
composition). The RHD models predict stellar granulation qualitatively similar
to the familiar solar pattern. Quantitatively, the granular cells show a
convective turn-over time scale of ~100s, and a horizontal scale of 80km; the
relative intensity contrast of the granular pattern amounts to 1.1%, and
root-mean-square vertical velocities reach 240m/s at maximum. Deviations from
radiative equilibrium in the higher, formally convectively stable atmospheric
layers are found to be insignificant allowing a reliable modeling of the
atmosphere with 1D standard model atmospheres. A mixing-length parameter of
alpha=2.1 provides the best representation of the average thermal structure of
the RHD model atmosphere while alternative values are found when fitting the
asymptotic entropy encountered in deeper layers of the stellar envelope
alpha=1.5, or when matching the vertical velocity field alpha=3.5. The close
correspondence between RHD and standard model atmospheres implies that
presently existing discrepancies between observed and predicted stellar colors
in the M-dwarf regime cannot be traced back to an inadequate treatment of
convection in the 1D standard models. The RHD models predict a modest extension
of the convectively mixed region beyond the formal Schwarzschild stability
boundary which provides hints for the distribution of dust grains in cooler
(brown dwarf) atmospheres.

clearly anomalous among these nearby young stars. We compare the hardness ratio
distributions of stars in the three nearby groups with those of T Tauri stars,
the Hyades, and main sequence dwarfs in the field. This comparison demonstrates
that the X-ray spectra of F through M stars soften with age, and that F and G

is as yet unclear whether this trend can be attributed to age-dependent changes
in the intrinsic X-ray spectra of stars of type F and later, to a decrease in
the column density of circumstellar gas (e.g., in residual protoplanetary

converted explosively (i.e. on light crossing time scales) into relativistic
electrons of the same Lorentz factor, which are responsible for the production
of observed prompt gamma-ray emission of the burst. This conversion is the
result of the combined effects of the reflection of photons produced within the
flow by upstream located matter, their re-interception by the blast wave and
their eventual conversion into e^+e^--pairs in interactions with the
relativistic protons of the blast wave (via the p gamma --> p e^+e^- reaction).
This entire procedure is contingent on two conditions on the relativistic
protons: a kinematic one imposed by the threshold of the p gamma --> e^+e^-
reaction and a dynamic one related to the column density of the post shock
matter to the same process. This latter condition is in essence identical to
that of the criticality of a nuclear pile, hence the terminology. It is argued
that the properties of relativistic blast waves operating under these
conditions are consistent with GRB phenomenology, including the recently found
correlation between quiescence periods and subsequent flare fluence.
Furthermore, it is shown that, when operating near threshold, the resulting GRB
spectrum produces its peak luminosity at an energy (in the lab frame) E ~=
m_ec^2, thereby providing an answer to this outstanding question of GRBs.

additional kinematic confirmation that the CO emission emerges from the polar
ring. For the first time, the total molecular mass within a polar ring is

lower than in previous reports. The total amount of molecular gas and the

improves the structural quality of the deposited layers. For the films examined
just after deposition, the role of hydrogen appears in the increase of their

protective role against the oxidation of their surfaces. This role disappears

perform an updated numerical study of this decay mode in both the minimal

the largest rates are found in the ``focus point'' region, where the mu

provides an extension of the algebraic theory to include the case when $M$ is

Dwyer and Greenlees and of Schwede and Shipley. A central notion of
noncommutative ring theory related to Morita equivalence is that of central
separable or Azumaya algebras. For such an Azumaya algebra A, its Hochschild
cohomology HH^*(A,A) is concentrated in degree 0 and is equal to the center of
A. We introduce a notion of topological Azumaya algebra and show that in the
case when the ground S-algebra R is an Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum of a
commutative ring this notion specializes to classical Azumaya algebras. A
canonical example of a topological Azumaya R-algebra is the endomorphism
R-algebra F_R(M,M) of a finite cell R-module. We show that the spectrum of mod
2 topological K-theory KU/2 is a nontrivial topological Azumaya algebra over
the 2-adic completion of the K-theory spectrum widehat{KU}_2. This leads to the
determination of THH(KU/2,KU/2), the topological Hochschild cohomology of KU/2.

environment of nucleons, pions and kaons during the course of a relativistic
heavy ion collision can be understood by a `clustering' of mesons to build up
baryon-antibaryon pairs. This multi-mesonic (fusion-type) process has to exist
in medium due to the principle of detailed balance. Novel numerical
calculations for a dynamical setup are presented. They show that - at maximum
SPS energies - yields of each antihyperon specie are obtained which are
consistent with chemical saturated populations of T approximately 150-160 MeV,
in line with popular chemical freeze-out parameters extracted from thermal
model analyses.

relates the behavior of the expectation value of the Polyakov loop, and its
two-point functions, to the pressure. Defining the ``mass'' of three and two
gluon states from the imaginary and real parts of the Polyakov loop, while this
ratio is 3:2 in perturbation theory, at Tc it is 3:1. We also discuss the decay
of the deconfined state into hadrons.

Compton scattering at energies comparable to the pion mass. The amplitudes for
scattering on the proton and the deuteron, calculated to fourth order in small
momenta in chiral perturbation theory, contain four undetermined parameters
that are in one-to-one correspondence with the nucleon polarizabilities. These
polarizabilities are extracted from fits to data on elastic photon scattering
on hydrogen and deuterium. For the proton we find: alpha_p = 12.1 +/- 1.1 +/-
0.5, beta_p = 3.4 +/- 1.1 +/- 0.1, both in units of 10^{-4} fm^3. For the
isoscalar polarizabilities we obtain: alpha_N = 13.0 +/- 1.9 +3.9/-1.5 (in the
same units) while beta_N is consistent with zero, within sizeable error bars.

"physics/0209001","Hans Dehmelt","Hans Dehmelt","Longest Life in the Best of Health",,,,,"physics.bio-ph",,"  Throughout history, for reasons of health, well known personalities have
opted not to eat to satiety - to under-eat - with known benefits. Here, for the
benefits of under-eating a very simple explanation is offered and discussed in
some detail. Our distant ancestors, whose bodies we inherited, ate and weighed
a good deal less than we do. They had to run around every day to scour the
countryside for their scarce food, which kept them lean, hungry and healthy.
We, not so healthy relative over-weights, load up our shopping carts once a
week at the corner supermarket and simply eat too much for our ~50000-year-old
body design. Under-eating or not to eat one's fill appears to bring us somewhat
more in line with this design. Thereby, it causes our way of life to more
closely resemble the healthier one of our ancient forbears and enables us to
potentially live longer, to 100 and more. The putative underlying physiological
mechanisms for the health benefits of under-eating are of great interest and
therefore are touched upon here.

random walk on the line: decoherence in the quantum ``coin'' which drives the
walk, or the use of higher-dimensional coins to dilute the effects of
interference. We use the position variance as an indicator of classical
behavior, and find analytical expressions for this in the long-time limit; we
see that the multicoin walk retains the ``quantum'' quadratic growth of the
variance except in the limit of a new coin for every step, while the walk with
decoherence exhibits ``classical'' linear growth of the variance even for weak
decoherence.
