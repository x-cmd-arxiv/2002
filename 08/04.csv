We find that shot noise is strongly nonlinear as a function of bias and it is
enhanced for one- and two-Si wires due to the large contribution from the metal
electrodes. For longer wires it shows an oscillatory behavior for even and odd
number of atoms with opposite trend with respect to the conductance, indicating
that current fluctuations persist with increasing wire length.

envisaged by Onsager. The approach focuses on vortex loops which close to the
critical temperature form a fluctuating vortex tangle. As the transition is
approached, vortex lines proliferate and thereby disorder the superfluid state,
so that the system reverts to the normal state. It is shown in detail that loop
proliferation can be described in exactly the same way as cluster percolation.
Picturing vortex loops as worldlines of bosons, with one of the spatial
coordinates interpreted as the time coordinate, a quantitative description of
vortex loops can be given. Applying a rotation (to superfluids) or a magnetic
field (to superconductors), which suppresses the formation of vortex loops and
instead can lead to open vortex lines along the field direction, is shown to be
equivalent to taking the nonrelativistic limit. The nonrelativistic theory is
the one often used to study vortex lattice melting and to describe the
resulting entangled vortex liquid.

determined by the relative position and orientation of the closed contour
traversed by the system in the {V_L-V_R} plane, relative to the transmission
resonances in that plane. Integer values of Q (in units of e) are achieved when
a transmission peak falls inside the contour, and are given by the winding

acoustic waves, Q exhibits a staircase structure, with integer values,

  For the tractable case, i.e., using only one semaphore, we give two
algorithms for detecting race conditions from the trace of executing a parallel
program on p processors, where n semaphore operations are executed. The first
algorithm determines in O(n) time whether a race condition exists between any
two given operations. The second algorithm runs in O(np log n) time and outputs
a compact representation from which one can determine in O(1) time whether a
race condition exists between any two given operations. The second algorithm is
near-optimal in that the running time is only O(log n) times the time required
simply to write down the output.

that the diagonal matrix elements of the effective Hamiltonian governing the

then give rise to various processes at the next generation linear collider
(NLC), i.e., the top-charm associated productions via $e^+ e^-$, $e^- \gamma$

($V=g$, $\gamma $ or $Z$). All these processes involve the same part of the
parameter space of the MSSM. Through a comparative analysis for all these
processes at the NLC, we found the best channel to probe such SUSY-induced top
quark FCNC is the top-charm associated production in $\gamma \gamma$ collision,
which occurs at a much higher rate than $e^+ e^-$ or $e^- \gamma$ collision and
may reach the detectable level for some part of the parameter space. Since the
rates predicted by the Standard Model are far below the detectable level, the
observation of such FCNC events would be a robust indirect evidence of SUSY.
