We construct sharp tests for the existence of multiple dark matter components

functional constraints can be transformed into physically motivated model
parameters. From the growth function, the fraction of the dark matter in a
smooth component, such as a light neutrino, may be constrained to a statistical

sky fsky with redshift resolution dz=0.1. For the dark energy, a
parameterization in terms of the present energy density Omega_{DE}, equation of

sigma(w)=0.016 fsky^{-1/2} and a degenerate combination of the other two

minimally reddened (E[B-V] = 0.21 +/- 0.09 mag; Leonard et al. 2002). From
multiple lines of evidence, including the convincing fit of a ``Serkowski''
interstellar polarization (ISP) curve to the continuum polarization shape, we
conclude that the bulk of the observed polarization is likely due to dust along
the line of sight (l-o-s), and is not intrinsic to SN 1999gi. We present new
spectropolarimetric observations of four distant Galactic stars close to the
l-o-s to SN 1999gi (two are within 0.02 degrees), and find that all are null to
within 0.2%, effectively eliminating Galactic dust as the cause of the high
polarization. The high ISP coupled with the low reddening implies an
extraordinarily high polarization efficiency for the dust along this l-o-s in
NGC 3184: ISP / E(B-V) = 31^{+22}_{-9} % mag^{-1}. This is inconsistent with
the empirical Galactic limit (ISP / E[B-V] < 9% mag^{-1}), and represents the

hydrodynamical simulations that include preheating, we show that the level of
preheating required to explain local galaxy cluster structure has a dramatic

suggests that SZE surveys may be optimal for cosmology while X-ray surveys are
well suited for studies of the thermal history of the intracluster medium.

concept of separator field lines for coronal magnetic fields with a trivial
magnetic topology. An effective mechanism of a current layer formation in HFTs
is proposed. This mechanism is called magnetic pinching and it is caused by
large-scale shearing motions applied to the photospheric feet of HFTs in a way
as if trying to twist the HFT. It is shown that in the middle of an HFT such
motions produce a hyperbolic flow that causes an exponentially fast growth of
the current density in a thin force-free current layer. The magnetic energy
associated with the current layer that is built up over a few hours is
sufficient for a large flare. Other implications of HFT pinching for solar
flares are discussed as well.

  Sanchez and H. de Vega, Editors",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The main requirements for fueling an active galactic nucleus and to form
massive black holes are reviewed. Low-luminosity AGN can be fueled easily from
the local star clusters, near the nucleus, and the various stellar processes
are described. Above a certain luminosity (and therefore accretion rate)
large-scale gas flows from galactic scales are required. These can be driven by
gravity torques of non-axisymmetric perturbations, such as bars, spirals,
galaxy interactions. Observational evidence that these mechanisms are in action
is found for high enough luminosities. It is very frequent that starbursts are
also triggered through the same mechanisms, and the dense nuclear star clusters
formed provide fuel for the AGN over a longer time-scale.
  Secular internal evolution and more violent evolution through interactions
and mergers contribute to grow both a massive black hole and a bulge, and this
could explain the observed proportionality relation between the mass of these
two components.

distinct enhancement in the south. The X-ray emission from the SNR is well
described by a model of a thermal plasma which has yet to reach ionization
equilibrium. The hydrogen column of ~6.0 X 10^{22} cm^{-2} is consistent with

brief, for example because they are produced intermittently to conserve energy,
then it is essential to know when these signals will arrive at the Earth.
Different types of synchronization schemes are possible which vary in the
relative amount of effort which is required by the transmitter and the
receiver. Here the case is made for a scheme which is extremely simple for the
receiver: make observations of a target when it is at maximum angular distance
from the Sun (i.e. ""opposition""). This strategy requires the transmitter to
have accurate knowledge of the distance and proper motion of the Sun and the
orbit of the Earth. It is anticipated that within about the next 10 to 20 years
it will be possible to directly detect nearby extra-solar planets of
approximately terrestrial mass. As any extraterrestrial transmitters are
expected to have significantly more advanced technology it is therefore not
unreasonable to expect that these transmitters would be able to detect the
presence of the Earth and measure its orbit at even greater distances. In
addition to the simplicity to the receiver of implementing this strategy it has
the advantage that opposition is typically the time when observations are
easiest to make anyway. A number of all-sky surveys that have already been
performed naturally contain tiny ""opposition surveys"" within them. A full
all-sky opposition survey would require extensive time to complete with a
single moderate field of view telescope but different types of arrays might be
employed instead including some systems already under construction.

observed in Seyfert 2 galaxies. We suggest instead that the X-ray absorption
occurs in material located off the torus and/or accretion disk while the
optical extinction occurs in material located beyond the torus. The X-ray

ratio for galactic disks increases (the disks become thinner) with the
increasing of total mass-to-light ratio of the galaxies, which characterize the
contribution of dark halo to the total mass, and with the decreasing of central
deprojected disk brightness (surface density). Our results are in good
agreement with numerical models of collisionless disks evolved from subcritical
velocity dispersion state to a marginally stable equilibrium state. This
suggests that in most galaxies the vertical stellar velocity dispersion, which
determine the equilibrium disk thickness, is close to the minimum value, that

energy of the chain is small compared to the Coulomb energy and the chains are
always adsorbed on the colloid. We observe that the polarizability is large for
short chains and small electrical fields and shows a non-monotonic behavior
with the chain length at fixed charge density. The polarizability has a maximum
for a chain length equal to half of the circumference of the colloid. For long
chains we recover the polarizability of a classical conducting sphere. For
short chains, the existence of a permanent dipole moment of the complexes leads
to a van der Waal's-type long-range attraction between them. This attractive
interaction vanishes for long chains (i.e., larger than the colloidal size),
where the permanent dipole moment is negligible. For short distances the
complexes interact with a deep short-ranged attraction which is due to
energetic bridging for short chains and entropic bridging for long chains.
Exceeding a critical chain length eventually leads to a pure repulsion. This
shows that the stabilization of colloidal suspensions by polyelectrolyte
adsorption is strongly dependent on the chain size relative to the colloidal
size: for long chains the suspensions are always stable (only repulsive forces
between the particles), while for mid-sized and short chains there is
attraction between the complexes and a salting-out can occur.

the breakdown of hyperscaling in the Ising model can also be intepreted as due
to an infinite multiplicity of percolating Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters at the

more involved than expected due to the fact that the percolation variables

Superkamiokande results. We study the neutrino energy spectra in the
``relevant'' region of the first maximum of the oscillation at a given baseline
$L$. We find that to each baseline $L$ corresponds an ``optimal'' proton energy
$E_p$ which minimizes the required integrated proton intensity needed to
observe a fixed number of oscillated events. In addition, we find that the
neutrino event rate in the relevant region scales approximately linearly with
the proton energy. Hence, baselines $L$ and proton energies $E_p$ can be
adjusted and the performance for neutrino oscillation searches will remain
approximately unchanged provided that the product of the proton energy times
the number of protons on target remains constant. We apply these ideas to the
specific cases of 2.2, 4.4, 20, 50 and 400 GeV protons. We simulate focusing
systems that are designed to best capture the secondary pions of the

propagation shows the formation of caustics with multi-valued regions beyond

model with an exponential potential, which was recently proposed as an
effective action for the string theory tachyon in the approximation where
high-order spacetime derivatives of T are truncated. Since the actual string
tachyon dynamics contain derivatives of all orders, the tachyon BI model with
an exponential potential becomes inadequate when the caustics develop because
high order spatial derivatives of T become divergent. BI type tachyon theory
with a potential decreasing at large T could have interesting cosmological
applications because the tachyon field rolling towards its ground state at
infinity acts as pressureless dark matter. We find that inhomogeneous
cosmological tachyon fluctuations rapidly grow and develop multiple caustics.
Any considerations of the role of the tachyon field in cosmology will have to
involve finding a way to predict the behavior of the field at and beyond these
caustics.

These results imply that higher-dimensional black-hole spacetimes where the
Bohm metric replaces the usual round sphere metric are classically unstable. We
also show that the stability criterion for Freund-Rubin solutions is the same
as for black-hole stability, and hence such solutions using Bohm metrics will
also be unstable. We consider possible endpoints of the instabilities, and show
that all Einstein-Sasaki manifolds give stable solutions. We show how Wick
rotation of Bohm metrics gives spacetimes that provide counterexamples to a
strict form of the Cosmic Baldness conjecture, but they are still consistent
with the intuition behind the cosmic No-Hair conjectures. We show how the

using supersymmetry and supression in the BMN limit. The same argument implies

the Gaussian and exponential decay processes in quantum decay systems. It is
usually expected that the decay is decelerated by a confinement potential
barrier. However, we find a case where the decay in the transition period is
accelerated by tunneling through a confinement potential barrier. We show that
the acceleration gives rise to an appreciable effect on the time evolution of
the nonescape probability of the decay system.

of psycho-physical parallelism and about how we could define probabilities for
our individual future observations given our individual present and previous
observations. The complexity of the problems is underlined by arguments that
unpredictability in ordinary everyday neural functioning, ultimately stemming
from small-scale uncertainties in molecular motions, may overwhelm, by many
orders of magnitude, many conventionally recognized sources of observed
``quantum'' uncertainty. Some possible ways of avoiding the problems are
considered but found wanting. It is proposed that a complete understanding of
the relationship between subjective experience and its physical correlates
requires the introduction of mathematical definitions and indeed of new
physical laws.

leading term has already taken into account the correct strong-coupling
behaviour. In the simplest cases of zero and one dimension we have obtained
reasonable results in a simple way. Then, this technique is applied to the
superrenormalizable scalar theory phi^4_2 in two dimensions. This results in an
accurate estimation of the ground-state energy that provides exact weak- and
strong-coupling behaviour already in the leading-order approximation. The
next-to-leading terms give rise in insignificant corrections.

related to the dispersive limit) becomes small, we immediately get a diagonal
effective Hamiltonian that represents correctly the dynamics for arbitrary
states and long times. We apply the same technique to obtain how the noise
terms in the original model transform under this scheme, providing a systematic
way of including damping effects in processes described in terms of effective
Hamiltonians.

a new model for the efficient generation and use of variable length codes. In
this picture lossless data compression can be seen as the {\em minimum energy}
required to faithfully represent or transmit classical information contained
within a quantum state.
  In order to represent information we create quanta in some predefined modes
(i.e. frequencies) prepared in one of two possible internal states (the
information carrying degrees of freedom). Data compression is now seen as the
selective annihilation of these quanta, the energy of whom is effectively
dissipated into the environment. As any increase in the energy of the
environment is intricately linked to any information loss and is subject to
Landauer's erasure principle, we use this principle to distinguish lossless and
lossy schemes and to suggest bounds on the efficiency of our lossless
compression protocol.
  In line with the work of Bostr\""{o}m and Felbinger \cite{bostroem}, we also
show that when using variable length codes the classical notions of prefix or
uniquely decipherable codes are unnecessarily restrictive given the structure
of quantum mechanics and that a 1-1 mapping is sufficient. In the absence of
this restraint we translate existing classical results on 1-1 coding to the
quantum domain to derive a new upper bound on the compression of quantum
information. Finally we present a simple quantum circuit to implement our
scheme.

band gap states of silicon can influence charge carrier recombination. Based on
this effect, a readout concept for silicon based solid-state spin--quantum
computers as proposed by Kane is suggested. The 31P quantum bit (qbit) is
connected via hyperfine coupling to the spin of the localized donor electron.
When a second localized and singly occupied electronic state with an energy
level deep within the band gap or close to the valence edge is in proximity, a
gate controlled exchange between the 31P nucleus and the two electronic states
can be activated that leaves the donor-deep level pair either unchanged in a
|T->-state or shifts it into a singlet state |S>. Since the donor deep level
transition is spin-dependent, the deep level becomes charged or not, depending
on the nuclear spin orientation of the donor nucleus. Thus, the state of the
qbit can be read with a sequence of light pulses and photo conductivity
measurements.
