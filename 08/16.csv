three-dimensional relativistic numerical hydrodynamic calculations. We find

IL Lupi and Nova Scorpii with ZAMS ~ 2.5 M_sun companions the orbits are
greatly widened because of large mass loss in the explosion forming the black
hole, and whereas these companions are in late main sequence evolution, they
are close to evolving. Binaries with companion ZAMS masses >~ 3 M_sun are
initially ""silent"" until the companion begins evolving across the Herzsprung
gap. We provide evidence that the narrower, shorter period binaries, with
companions now in main sequence, are fossil remnants of gamma ray bursters
(GRBs). We also show that the GRB is generally accompanied by a hypernova
explosion (a very energetic supernova explosion). We further show that the
binaries with evolved companions are good models for some of the ultraluminous
X-ray sources (ULXs) recently seen by Chandra in other galaxies. The great
regularity in our evolutionary history, especially the fact that most of the
companions of ZAMS mass <~ 2.5 M_sun remain in main sequences as K or M stars
can be explained by the mass loss in common envelope evolution to be Case C;
i.g., to occur only after core He burning has finished. Since our argument for
Case C mass transfer is not generally understood in the community, we add an

scintillation (ISS) of a 30 by 22 micro-as source, with about 180 degree
rotation of the polarization angle along its long dimension. This success in
explaining the remarkable intra-day variations (IDV)in polarization confirms
that ISS gives rise to the IDV in this quasar. However, the fit requires the

30% of the sound speed even when a cluster is relatively relaxed. Nevertheless,
the velocity averaged over the kSZ map inside a circular aperture matched to
the cluster virial region provides an unbiased estimate of a cluster's radial
peculiar velocity with a dispersion of 50 to 100 km/s, depending on the line of
sight and dynamical state of the cluster. This dispersion puts a lower limit on
the accuracy with which cluster peculiar velocity can be measured. Although the
dispersion of the average is relatively small, the velocity distribution is
broad; regions of low signal must be treated with care to avoid bias. We
discuss the extent to which systematic errors might be modelled, and the
resulting limitations on using galaxy clusters as cosmological velocity

induces so-called helicoidal oscillations, in which energy is redistributed
among the different modes. We find that the amplitude of these oscillations can
be quite substantial, with some of the higher harmonics becoming comparable to
the original field. Nevertheless, this transfer of energy to the higher
harmonics is not sufficient to significantly accelerate the decay of the
original field, at least not at the R_B = O(100) parameter values accessible to
us, where this Hall parameter R_B measures the ratio of the Ohmic timescale to
the Hall timescale. We do find clear evidence though of increasingly fine

vigorous to enhance the decay of the original field. Finally, the implications

steep temperature gradient, exposing them to excitation by electrons
characteristic of higher temperatures than those describing their ionization
state. We present the results of calculations which use a more physical
representation of the lifetimes of the ground states of He I and He II than was

The period and the amplitude of the oscillations decrease spatially in one

theoretically. In the k-p model, the oscillation period decreases, and agrees
with experiments. The spatial difference of the static potential is estimated
as 1.3 eV for 200 nm in distance, and this value seems to be reasonable in
order that the potential difference remains against perturbations, for example,
by phonon fluctuations and impurity scatterings. It turns out that the
long-distance oscillations come from the band structure of the two-dimensional

increases with an increasing temperature, reaching its maximum value close to
the Curie temperature of the system. At T=0 the system is isotropic, besides a
small remaining anisotropy due to the zero-point motion of quantum mechanical
spins. The reason for the dipole-coupling-induced anisotropy is the disturbance
of the square spin lattice due to thermal fluctuations ('order-by-disorder'
effect). For usual ferromagnets its strength is small as compared to other
anisotropic contributions, and decreases by application of an external magnetic
field. The results are obtained from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian by application of

insight into how the microscopic dynamics of the model determine the observed
macroscopic phenomena published previously. The dynamics of the Tangled Nature
model is defined on the microevolutionary time scale via reproduction, with
heredity, variation, and natural selection. Each organism reproduces with a
rate that is linked to the individuals' genetic sequence and depends on the
composition of the population in genotype space. Thus the microevolutionary
dynamics of the fitness landscape is regulated by, and regulates, the evolution
of the species by means of the mutual interactions. At low mutation rate, the
macro evolutionary pattern mimics the fossil data: periods of stasis, where the
population is concentrated in a network of coexisting species, is interrupted
by bursts of activity. As the mutation rate increases, the duration and the
frequency of bursts increases. Eventually, when the mutation rate reaches a
certain threshold, the population is spread evenly throughout the genotype
space showing that natural selection only leads to multiple distinct species if
adaptation is allowed time to cause fixation.

this SU(4) as a subgroup, suggesting a connection between our SU(4) model and
the Zhang SO(5) model. In order to understand the relationship between the the
two models, we have used generalized coherent states to analyze the nature of
the SO(5) subgroup. By constructing coherent-state energy surfaces, we
demonstrate explicitly that the SU(4) supset SO(5) symmetry can be interpreted
as a critical dynamical symmetry interpolating between superconducting and
antiferromagnetic phases, and that this critical dynamical symmetry has many
similarities to critical dynamical symmetries identified previously in other
fields of physics. More generally, we demonstrate with this example that the
mathematical techniques associated with generalized coherent states may have
powerful applications in condensed matter physics because they provide a clear
connection between microscopic many-body theories and their broken-symmetry
approximate solutions. In addition, these methods may be interpreted as
defining the most general Bogoliubov transformation subject to a Lie group
symmetry constraint, thus providing a mathematical connection between algebraic
formulations and the language of quasiparticle theory. Finally, we suggest that
the identification of the SO(5) symmetry as a critical dynamical symmetry
implies deep algebraic connections between high-temperature superconductors and
seemingly unrelated phenomena in other field of physics.

total lifetime of the human race. By examining the case of an individual
lifetime, I conclude that the argument is fundamentally related to
consciousness. I derive a reformulation stating that an infinite conscious
lifetime is not possible even in principle. By considering a hypothetical
conscious computer, running a non-terminating program, I deduce that
consciousness cannot be generated by a single set of deterministic laws.
Instead, I hypothesize that consciousness is generated by a superposition of
brain states that is simultaneously associated with many quasi-classical
histories, each following a different set of deterministic laws. I generalize
the doomsday argument and discover that it makes no prediction in this case.
Thus I conclude that the very fact of our consciousness provides us with
evidence for a many-worlds interpretation of reality in which our future is not
predictable using anthropic reasoning.

The irreversibility is related to a particle production process at the expense
of the gravitational energy and of the inflaton energy. The particle production
process is represented by a non-equilibrium pressure in the energy-momentum

and its proportionality factor is identified with the coefficient of bulk

ordinary heat bath entropy. The desired limit, in which the split distance
vanishes and the localization on the horizon becomes sharp, can at most yield a
relative area density which measures the ratio of area densities for different

unknown analog of a second fundamental law of thermodynamics for thermalization

approximation exhibits cyclic behaviour with an amplitude determined by the
initial condition. When stochastic phenomena are taken into account the
amplitude of oscillations will drift and eventually one and then two of the
three species will become extinct. The second model remains stationary for all
initial conditions in the mean field approximation, and drifts when stochastic
phenomena are considered. We analyzed the distribution of first extinction
times of both models by simulations and from the point of view of the
Fokker-Planck equation. Survival probability vs. time plots suggest an
exponential decay. For the neutral model the extinction rate is inversely
proportional to the system size, while the cyclic model exhibits anomalous
behaviour for small system sizes. In the large system size limit the extinction
times for both models will be the same. This result is compatible with the
smallest eigenvalue obtained from the numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck
equation. We also studied the long--time behaviour of the probability
distribution. The exponential decay is found to be robust against certain
changes, such as the three reactions having different rates.

of the domain of the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) equation, raised by Stickel et
al. (J. Chem. Phys.,1995, 1996) and discussed by Richert and Angell (ibid.,
1998). A new ergodic-cluster Gaussian statistical approach to the problem is
given based on Onsager's thermodynamic principle. The primary relaxation is
described by the VFT equation below the crossover temperature T_c (known from
mode coupling theory (MCT)), and above T_c by an extended (VFTE) equation
obtained after accounting for cluster-size fluctuations. The timescale is
parametrized by a finite number of observable parameters such as the steepness
function m_T, the MCT slowing-down exponent gamma_c, and the VFT and VFTE
strength indices D_g and D_c. The latter are defined at T_g and T_c,
respectively, for the strongly and moderately SCL states, which show absolute
thermodynamic instability at the same VFT temperature T_0, associated with the
Kauzmann temperature. For both states the limiting cluster-size characteristics
are derived from experiment. A thermodynamic-dynamic correspondence is
established between the dynamic VFT equation and the thermodynamic Adam and

discrete-time system with input and output channels and a feedback, is
described. A dynamical theory of quantum discrete-time adaptive measurements
and multi-stage quantum statistical decisions is developed and applied to the
optimal feedback control problem for the quantum dynamical objects. Quantum
analogies of Stratonovich non-stationary filtering, and Bellman quantum
dynamical programming in the discrete time are derived.
  A Gaussian Langevin model of the quantum one-dimensional linear Markovian
dynamical system matched with a quantum linear transmission line as an
input-output quantum noisy channel is studied. The optimal quantum multi-stage
decision rule consisting of a classical linear optimal control strategy and the
quantum optimal filtering of the noise is found. The latter contains the
optimal quantum coherent measurement on the output of the line and the
recursive processing by the Kalman filter.
  A time-continuous limit of the above model is considered, and the quantum
nondemolition measurement, time-continuous filtering and the optimal dynamical
programming are found in this limit. All the results are illustrated by an
example of the optimal control problem for a quantum open oscillator matched to
a quantum transmission line.

maps the quantum evolution onto an ensemble of stochastic trajectories over a
classical state space. Detailed mechanism identification is illustrated with a
model 7-level system. A general procedure is presented to extract mechanism
information directly from closed-loop control experiments. Application to

and classified for semifinite von Neumann algebras. We show that the
classical-quantum correspondences such as quantum encodings can be treated as
diagonal semi-classical (d-) couplings, and the entanglements characterized by
truly quantum (q-) couplings, can be regarded as truly quantum encodings. The
relative entropy of the d-compound and entangled states leads to two different
types of entropy for a given quantum state: the von Neumann entropy, which is
achieved as the maximum of mutual information over all d-entanglements, and the
dimensional entropy, which is achieved at the standard entanglement -- true
quantum entanglement, coinciding with a d-entanglement only in the case of pure
marginal states. The d- and q- information of a quantum noisy channel are
respectively defined via the input d- and q- encodings, and the q-capacity of a
quantum noiseless channel is found as the logarithm of the dimensionality of
the input algebra. The quantum capacity may double the classical capacity,
achieved as the supremum over all d-couplings, or encodings, bounded by the
logarithm of the dimensionality of a maximal Abelian subalgebra.

states on an operator algebra to include the classical and quantum encodings as
particular cases. The true quantum entanglements are characterized by quantum
couplings which are described as transpose-CP, but not Completely Positive
(CP), trace-normalized linear positive maps of the algebra.
  The entangled (total) information is defined in this paper as a relative
entropy of the conditional (the derivative of the compound state with respect
to the input) and the unconditional output states. Thus defined the total
information of the entangled states leads to two different types of the entropy
for a given quantum state: the von Neumann entropy, or c-entropy, which is
achieved as the supremum of the information over all c-entanglements and thus
is semi-classical, and the true quantum entropy, or q-entropy, which is
achieved at the standard entanglement.
  The q-capacity, defined as the supremum over all entanglements, coincides
with the topological entropy. In the case of the simple algebra it doubles the
c-capacity, coinciding with the rank-entropy. The conditional q-entropy based
on the q-entropy, is positive, unlike the von Neumann conditional entropy, and
the q-information of a quantum channel is proved to be additive.
