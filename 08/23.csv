magneto-Jeans (MJI), and swing mechanisms in galactic disks. The model disks
are local, isothermal, and begin from a vertically-stratified equilibrium. We
first construct axisymmetric equilibria and examine their stability. Finite
disk thickness reduces the critical Toomre Q parameter below unity; we find Q_c
\~ 0.75, 0.72, and 0.57 for \beta=\infty, 10, and 1 cases, respectively. We
then pursue fully 3D models. In non-self-gravitating cases, the peak density
enhancement from the `pure' Parker instability is less a factor of two. The
dominant growing modes have radial wavelengths comparable to the disk scale
height H, much shorter than the azimuthal wavelength (~10-20 H). Shearing
disks, being more favorable to midplane-symmetric modes, have somewhat
different late-time magnetic field profiles from nonshearing disks, but
otherwise saturated states are similar. Late-time velocity fluctuations at 10%
of the sound speed persist, but no characteristic structural signatures of
Parker modes remain in the new equilibria. In self-gravitating cases, the
development of density structure is qualitatively similar to our previous
results from thin-disk simulations. The Parker instability, although it may
help seed structure or tip the balance under marginal conditions, appears to
play a secondary role. In shearing disks with Q less than a threshold level ~
1, swing amplification can produce bound clouds of a few times the local Jeans
mass. The most powerful cloud-condensing mechanism appears to be the MJI. Our
simulations show that condensations of a local Jeans mass (~3\times 10^7 M_sun)
grow very rapidly, supporting the idea that MJI is at least partly responsible
for the formation of bound cloud complexes in spiral galaxies.

with a recent measurement of the shock velocity based on spectra of the same

the improved distance measurement can be combined with the peak luminosity for
SNeIa, as determined for events in galaxies with Cepheid-based distances, to
calculate the apparent brightness of the spectacular event that drew wide
attention in the eleventh century. The result, V_max = -7.5 =/- 0.4, lies
squarely in the middle of the wide range of estimates based on the historical

ionization by cosmic rays. We have then used these results to study the
stability of cores in the limit where thermal pressure dominates over magnetic
field and turbulence. We find that for cores with characteristics similar to
those observed, the gas and dust temperatures are coupled in the core interior.
As a consequence, the gas temperature like the dust temperature decreases
towards the center of these objects. The density structure computed taking into
account such deviations from isothermality are not greatly different from that
expected for an isothermal Bonnor-Ebert sphere. It is impossible in the
framework of these models to have a stable equilibrium core with mass above
about 5 solar masses and column density compatible with observed values. We
conclude from this that observed high mass cores are either supported by
magnetic field or turbulence or are already in a state of collapse. Lower mass
cores on the other hand have stable states and we conclude that the much
studied object B68 may be in a state of stable equilibrium if the internal gas
temperature is computed in self-consistent fashion. Finally we note that in
molecular clouds such as Ophiuchus and Orion with high radiation fields and
pressures, gas and dust temperatures are expected to be well coupled and hence
one expects temperatures to be relatively high as compared to low pressure
clouds like Taurus.

which all three independent time delays have been measured. This makes the
system an excellent candidate for a high-quality determination of H_0 at
cosmological distances. However, the original measurements of the time delays
had large (12-20%) uncertainties, due to the low level of variability of the
background source during the monitoring campaign. In this paper, we present
results from two additional VLA monitoring campaigns. In contrast to the ~5%
variations seen during the first season of monitoring, the source flux density
changed by 25-30% in each of the subsequent two seasons. We analyzed the
combined data set from all three seasons of monitoring to improve significantly
the precision of the time delay measurements; the delays are consistent with
those found in the original measurements, but the uncertainties have decreased
by factors of two to three. We combined the delays with revised isothermal mass
models to derive a measurement of H_0. Depending on the positions of the galaxy
centroids, which vary by up to 0.1 arcsec in HST images obtained with different
filters, we obtain H_0 = 61-65 km/s/Mpc, for (Omega_M,Omega_L) = (0.3,0.7). The
value of H_0 decreases by 6% if (Omega_M,Omega_L) = (1.0,0.0). The formal
uncertainties on H_0 due to the time delay measurements are +/- 1 (+/- 2)
km/s/Mpc for the 1-sigma (2-sigma) confidence limits. Thus, the systematic
uncertainties due to the lens model, which are on the order of +/- 15 km/s/Mpc,
now dominate the error budget for this system. In order to improve the
measurement of H_0 with this lens, new models that incorporate the constraints

from the integrated optical colors of the stream and its dynamical disruption
timescale have values of 200-400 Myr. We propose that this stream of young

rate which is measured by the halfwidth of the QPO feature. Taking into account
this effect I analyze the QPO data for four Z-sources: Sco X-1, GX 340+0, GX

studied the heating of the disc due to giant molecular clouds and halo black
holes, using simulations of the orbits of tracer stars embedded in a patch of
the local Galactic disc. We examine a range of masses and number densities of
the giant molecular cloud and halo black hole perturbers. The heating of the
stellar disc in the simulations is fit with a simple power law, and we also fit
this form to the best determinations of Age-Velocity relation as derived from
stars in the solar neighbourhood for which ages can be reliably assigned.
Observationally, the Age-Velocity relation remains poorly constrained and its
determination is probably still dominated by systematic errors. Our simulations
confirm the well known results that there are insufficient GMCs to heat the
Galactic disc appropriately. A range of dark halo black hole scenarios are
verified to heat the stellar disc in the manner expected from analytical
studies, and they reproduce the observed ratio of the stellar velocity
dispersions. Simulations featuring a combination of giant molecular clouds and
halo black holes can explain the observed heating of the stellar disc, but
since other perturbing mechanisms, such as spiral arms, are yet to be

ionizing star, as predicted by the standard bubble model. The observed upper
limits for the expansion velocities of N44J and N44M are also compatible with
the expected values, within the uncertainties. We also report the discovery in
N44F of strongly-defined dust columns, similar to those seen in the Eagle

important and may actually govern the evolution of the shell. The inclusion of

(sigma=3.5uJy), sensitive enough to detect an active galaxy with L_1.4>10^23

most of these radio EROs are consistent with dust-reddened starbursts at z~1.
At z~1 the radio luminosities of these EROs indicate far-infrared luminosities
of L_FIR>10^12 Lo, meaning half are ultraluminous infrared galaxies. We
conclude that >16+/-5% of EROs with K<20.5 are luminous infrared galaxies at
z>1. We also photometrically classify the EROs to investigate the mix of
dusty/active and evolved/passive systems in the radio-undetected EROs. We
suggest that at least 30%, and perhaps up to ~60%, of all EROs with R-K>5.3 and
K<20.5 are dusty, star-forming systems at z>1. The SFD in this optically faint
(R>26) population is rho^* (0.1-100Mo)=0.11+/-0.03 Mo/yr/Mpc^3, comparable to
that in H-alpha emitting galaxies at z~1, and greater than that in UV-selected
samples at these epochs. This support the claim of a strong increase in
obscured star formation at high redshifts. Using the observed counts of the
radio-detected EROs we model the break in the K-band number counts of all EROs
at K~19-20 and propose that the passive ERO class dominates the total
population in a narrow range around K~20, with dusty EROs dominating at fainter

surface is fixed by recursively computed counterterms. The physical picture
that emerges is that couplings that are irrelevant tend to deform the Fermi
surface in order to become more relevant (irrelevant couplings being those that
do not exist at vanishing excitation energy because of kinematical constraints
attached to the Fermi surface). These insights are incorporated in a
renormalization group approach, which allows for a simple approximate
computation of Fermi surface deformation in quasi one-dimensional electronic
conductors. We also analyze flow equations for the effective couplings and
quasiparticle weights. For systems away from half-filling, the flows show three
regimes corresponding to a Luttinger liquid at high energies, a Fermi liquid,
and a low-energy incommensurate spin-density wave. At half-filling Umklapp
processes allow for a Mott insulator regime where the dressed Fermi surface is
flat, implying a confined phase with vanishing effective transverse

phases is found to occur for a bare transverse hopping amplitude of the order
of the Mott charge gap of a single chain.

Carlo technique supplemented by the more approximate Hubbard I and Hartree Fock

moment, and an entropy consistent with degeneracy in the moment direction. On
compression through the volume range of the observed gamma-alpha transition, an
Abrikosov-Suhl resonance begins to grow rapidly in the 4f spectra at the Fermi
level, a corresponding peak develops in the specific heat, and the entropy
drops rapidly in the presence of a persistent, although somewhat reduced local
moment. Our parameter-free spectra agree well with experiment at the alpha- and
gamma-Ce volumes, and a region of negative curvature in the correlation energy
leads to a shallowness in the low-temperature total energy over this volume
range which is consistent with the gamma-alpha transition. As measured by the
double occupancy, we find a noticeable decrease in correlation on compression
across the transition; however, even at the smallest volumes considered, Ce
remains strongly correlated with residual Hubbard bands to either side of a
dominant Fermi-level structure. These characteristics are discussed in light of

determination of the spectrum of multifractal exponents $\Delta_q$ governing
the scaling of moments $<|\psi|^{2q}>\sim L^{-qd-\Delta_q}$ with the system
size $L$ and the spatial decay of wave function correlations. Two- and
three-point correlation functions are calculated analytically by means of
mapping onto the classical percolation, yielding the values $\Delta_2=-1/4$ and
$\Delta_3=-3/4$. The multifractality spectrum obtained from numerical
simulations is given with a good accuracy by the parabolic approximation
$\Delta_q\simeq q(1-q)/8$ but shows detectable deviations. We also study
statistics of the two-point conductance $g$, in particular, the spectrum of
exponents $X_q$ characterizing the scaling of the moments $<g^q >$. Relations
between the spectra of critical exponents of wave functions ($\Delta_q$),
conductances ($X_q$), and Green functions at the localization transition with a
critical density of states are discussed.

coupling display several unusual and new features with respect to systems with
short-range interactions. The Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model represents a
paradigmatic example of this class of systems. The present study addresses both
attractive and repulsive interactions, with a particular emphasis on the
description of clustering phenomena from a thermodynamical as well as from a
dynamical point of view. The observed clustering transition can be first or
second order, in the usual thermodynamical sense. In the former case, ensemble
inequivalence naturally arises close to the transition, i.e. canonical and
microcanonical ensembles give different results. In particular, in the
microcanonical ensemble negative specific heat regimes and temperature jumps
are observed. Moreover, having access to dynamics one can study non-equilibrium
processes. Among them, the most striking is the emergence of coherent
structures in the repulsive model, whose formation and dynamics can be studied
either by using the tools of statistical mechanics or as a manifestation of the
solutions of an associated Vlasov equation. The chaotic character of the HMF
model has been also analyzed in terms of its Lyapunov spectrum.

obtained both in bulk samples and Ag-sheathed tapes. The possibility of
crystallising the Bi,Pb(2223) phase from the melt was found to be extremely
sensitive to the temperature and strongly dependent on the Pb losses. The study
of the mass losses due to Pb evaporation was complemented by thermogravimetric
analysis which proved that Pb losses are responsible for moving away from
equilibrium and therefore hinder the reformation of the Bi,Pb(2223) phase from
the melt. Thanks to the full pattern profile refinement, a quantitative phase
analysis was carried out as a function of time and temperature and the role of

were found to occur at high temperature in Bi,Pb(2223), Bi,Pb(2212),

Standard Model. In particular, we consider the decays B -> V gamma, with a
vector meson K* or rho in the final state, and the double radiative modes B_s
-> gamma gamma and B_d -> gamma gamma. At quark level, all these decays are
governed by the flavour-changing neutral-current b -> s gamma or b -> d gamma
transitions, which appear at the one-loop level in the Standard Model. Such
processes allow us to study CP violation and the interplay of strong and
electroweak interactions, to determine parameters of the CKM matrix, and to
search for New Physics. The exclusive decays are experimentally better
accessible, but pose more problems for the theoretical analysis. The
heavy-quark limit m_b >> Lambda_QCD, however, allows to systematically separate
perturbatively calculable hard scattering kernels from nonperturbative form
factors and universal light-cone distribution amplitudes. For the B -> V gamma
decays we evaluate the leading Lambda_QCD/m_b contributions complete to
next-to-leading order in QCD, including also QCD penguin operators. The double
radiative B -> gamma gamma decays are analyzed with leading-logarithmic
accuracy. We predict branching ratios, CP and isospin asymmetries, and estimate
U-spin breaking effects for B -> K* gamma and B -> rho gamma. For the B ->
gamma gamma decays we give numerical results for branching ratios and CP
asymmetries.

ultracold environment, provided that a dc electric field is present. The field
that links the molecules together also strongly influences the basic properties
of the resulting dimer, such as its binding energy and predissociation
lifetime. Because of their long-range character these dimers will be useful in
disentangling cold collision dynamics of polar molecules. As an example, we
estimate the microwave photoassociation yield for OH-OH cold collisions.

are made for the experiments, with analysis of requirements on the quality of
nanosamples and resolution of the experimental set-up. Based on Monte Carlo
simulations, the capabilities of nanotube channeling technique for particle
beam steering are discussed.

"physics/0208082","Ching-Chuan Su","Ching-Chuan Su","Local-Ether Wave Equation of Electric Field and Interferometry
  Experiments with Moving Medium and Path",,,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Recently, we have presented the local-ether model, whereby the propagation of
earthbound waves is supposed to be referred uniquely to a geostationary
inertial frame. Further, in order to comply with this propagation model, the
modified Lorentz force law is developed. Thereby, the corresponding wave
equations of potentials and fields are derived in this investigation. It is
shown that the local-ether wave equation of electric field can account for
various precision interferometry experiments in a consistent way, including the
one-way-link experiment with a geostationary fiber, the Sagnac rotating-loop
experiment with a comoving or a geostationary dielectric medium, and Fizeau's
experiment with a moving dielectric medium in a geostationary interferometer.
These experiments together then provide a support for the local-ether wave
equation. Meanwhile, some other phenomena are predicted, which provide a means
to test its validity.

  Earth's Rotation on Quantum Energy in Atoms and with the Electromagnetic
  Force",,,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Recently, we have presented a local-ether wave equation incorporating a
nature frequency and the electric scalar potential, from which the
speed-dependences in the angular frequency and wavelength of matter wave, in
the mass of particle, and in the energy of quantum states are derived. These
relations look like the postulates of de Broglie and the Lorentz mass-variation
law, except that the particle speed is referred specifically to a geocentric
inertial frame and hence incorporates earth's rotation for earthbound
particles. Further, the wave equation is extended by connecting the scalar
potential to the augmentation operator which is associated with a velocity
difference between involved particles. Then the electromagnetic force law is
derived, which under some ordinary conditions reduces to the modified Lorentz
force law. In this investigation, the interaction of atoms with electromagnetic
radiation is explored. Then it is shown that the time evolution equation
derived from the wave equation is substantially identical to Schr\""{o}dinger's
equation incorporating the vector potential, if the latter is observed in the
atom frame and if the source generating the vector potential is electrically
neutralized, as in common practice.

all ions are simultaneously coupled to bichromatic laser fields. It is shown
that in a time-averaged, coarse-grained picture the system can be mapped onto a
spin ensemble with controllable collective interactions. An adiabatic change of
laser parameters allows a transfer from separable to entangled eigenstates of
the many-particle Hamiltonian. Of particular interest is a transition in the
ground state which in some cases corresponds to a quantum phase transition. The
influence of decoherence mechanisms can be substantially reduced if at all
times a sufficiently large energy gap between the ground state and the first
excited state is maintained.
