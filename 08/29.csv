The data consists of VLT UVES observations in the 3100 to 10350 A range. The

permitted lines of H 0, He 0, C 0, C+, N+, N++, O 0, O+, Ne 0, Ne+, S+, S++, Si
0 , Si+, Si++, Ar+, and Mg+. Electron temperatures and densities have been
determined using different line intensity ratios. The He+, C++, O+, and O++
ionic abundances have been derived from recombination lines, these abundances
are almost independent of the temperature structure of the nebula.
Alternatively abundances from collisionally excited lines have been derived for
a large number of ions of different elements, these abundances depend strongly
on the temperature structure. Accurate t^2 values have been derived from the
Balmer continuum, and by comparing the C++, O+, and O++ ionic abundances
obtained from collisionally excited and recombination lines. The chemical
composition of 30 Doradus is compared with those of Galactic and extragalactic
HII regions. The values of Delta Y / Delta O, Delta Y / Delta Z, and Yp are
also discussed.

fitting two representative models to the Coma cluster. If the synchrotron
emitting relativistic electrons are accelerated in situ from the vast pool of
thermal electrons, then a quasi-stationary solution of the kinetic equation
with particle acceleration through turbulence at high energies (>200 keV)
naturally produces a population of supra-thermal electrons responsible for the
excess hard X-ray emission through bremsstrahlung. Inverse Compton scattering
is negligible at hard X-ray energies in this case. The radio halo flux density
constrains the magnetic field strength to a value close to that of
equipartition ~1 uG. Alternatively, if the relativistic electrons are injected
from numerous localised `external' sources then the hard X-rays are best
explained by inverse Compton scattering from GeV electrons, and little of the
hard X-radiation has a bremsstrahlung origin. In this case, the magnetic field
strength is constrained to ~0.1-0.2 uG. Both models assume that the non-thermal
emissions are generated by a single electron spectrum, so that only two free
parameters, well constrained by the observed hard X-ray and radio halo spectra,
are needed in either case. Measurements of the cluster magnetic field will
distinguish between the models.

``MCS deconvolution algorithm''. The algorithm decomposes two dimensional
spectra into the individual spectra of the central point-like nucleus and of
its host galaxy. Applied to HE1503+0228, at z=0.135 (M_B=-23.0), it provides us
with the spectrum of the host galaxy between 3600A, and 8500A, (rest-frame), at
a mean resolving power of 700. The data allow us to measure several of the
important Lick indices. The stellar populations and gas ionization state of the
host galaxy of HE1503+0228, are very similar to the ones measured for normal
non-AGN galaxies. Dynamical information is also available for the gas and
stellar components of the galaxy. Using deconvolution and a deprojection
algorithm, velocity curves are derived for emission lines, from the center up
to 4arcsec, away from the nucleus of the galaxy. Fitting a simple
three-components mass model (point mass, spherical halo of dark matter, disk)
to the position-velocity diagram, we infer a mass of M(r<1kpc) = (2.0 +- 0.3)
10^{10} solar mass within the central kiloparsec of the galaxy, and a mass
integrated over 10 kpc of M(r<10kpc) = (1.9 +- 0.3) 10^{11} solar mass, with an
additional 10% error due to the uncertainty on the inclination of the galaxy.
This, in combination with the analysis of the stellar populations indicates
that the host galaxy of HE1503+0228, is a normal spiral galaxy.

accretion flow do not depend as much on the outer boundary conditions (i.e.,
the amount as well as distribution of the angular momentum) as on the geometry
of the non-accreting matter. The material that has too much angular momentum to
be accreted forms a thick torus near the equator. Consequently, the geometry of
the polar region, where material is accreted (the funnel), and the mass
accretion rate through it are constrained by the size and shape of the torus.
Our results show one way in which the mass accretion rate of slightly rotating

(i.e., the Bondi rate), and set the stage for calculations that will take into

A
two-dimensional time-dependent smoothed particle hydrodynamics scheme is used
to simulate the evolution of the accretion disc through a complete outburst.
The scheme includes the full tidal potential of the binary and a simple
treatment of the thermal-viscous disc instability.
  In the case where the mass accretion rate onto the primary determines the
fraction of the disc that can be kept in a hot, high viscosity state by the
resulting X-ray emission, we find that the shape of the X-ray light curve is
ultimately determined by the relative sizes of the irradiated and unirradiated
parts of the disc and the growth time-scale of the tidal instability.
  The model accounts for the rebrightening that has been observed in the light
curves of A0620-003 and several other transients. The primary maximum and
subsequent decline are due to the accretion of gas within the irradiated
portion of the disc, while the secondary maximum is caused by the accretion of
gas in the outer part of the disc that is initially shadowed from the central
X-rays, but subject to tidal forces. We propose that tidal effects at the disc
edge can be sufficient to drive accretion on a time-scale shorter than that
expected for a standard alpha-viscosity disc.
  The final decay is subsequently controlled by the gradual retreat of the
irradiated portion of the disc. If the entire disc is kept in the
high-viscosity state by the irradiation, no rebrightening is possible.

optimally choose the technique that is most suitable for one's needs.

  Proceedings are available as MPE-Report 278",,,"MPE-Report 278","astro-ph",,"  Rough estimates and upper limits on current and particle densities form the
basis of most of the canonical pulsar models. Whereas the surface of the
rotating neutron star is capable of supplying sufficient charges to provide a
current that, given the polar cap potential, could easily fuel the observed
energy loss processes, observational and theoretical constraints provide strict
upper limits to the charge densities. The space charge of a current consisting
solely of particles having only one sign creates a compensating potential that
will make the maximum current dependent on potential and distance. In the
non-relativistic case this fact is expressed in the familiar Child-Langmuir
law. Its relativistic generalization and subsequent application to the inner
pulsar magnetosphere provides clear limits on the strength and radial extension
of charged currents originating on the polar cap. Violent Pierce-type
oscillations set in, if one attempts to inject more current than the space
charge limit into a given volume. These considerations apply wherever there is
a significant amount of charged current flow, in particular in the gap regions.
There they can be used to derive limits on the size of such gaps and their
stability.

assumed an exponential law for the disc component and the S\'ersic law for the
bulges. We found that simulated objects at $z=0$ have bulge profiles with shape
parameters $n\approx 1$, consistent with observational results of spiral
galaxies. The complete sample of simulated objects at $z=0$ and $z>0$ shows
that $n$ takes values in the range $n\approx 0.4 - 4$. We found that secular
evolution tends to produce exponential bulge profiles, while the fusion of
baryonic cores tends to increase the $n$ value and helps to generate the
correlation between $B/D$ and $n$. We found no dependence on the relative mass
of the colliding objects. Our results suggest that mergers, through secular
evolution and fusions, could produce the transformation of galactic objects
along the Hubble sequence by driving a morphological loop that might also
depend on the properties of the central galactic potential wells, which are
also affected by mergers.

  Proceedings are available as MPE-Report 278",,,"MPE-Report 278","astro-ph",,"  We present a model for the gamma-ray emission of pulsars in terms of
curvature radiation by highly relativistic particles. It is shown that the
injection of power-law primary particles from an outer gap and subsequent
cooling by curvature radiation losses reproduces the high energy spectrum and
the luminosity of pulsars. As a result a spectral break is to be expected at a
photon energy of $\sim 1\thinspace{\rm GeV}$. This value does not depend on the
surface magnetic field strength or on the period of the neutron star, but only
involves a geometric factor. The predicted change of the spectral index by 1
explains in particular the spectral shape of PSR B1706--44. We find that
according to this model the luminosity of pulsars in the high energy band
varies according to $L_{\gamma}\propto B_0/P^{5/3}$, which is in good agreement
with the observations.
  A model for the infrared, optical and soft X-ray emission of pulsar is also
presented. It is based on anisotropic synchrotron emission by relativistic
particles in an outer gap scenario with a single energy distribution
$N(\gamma)\propto \gamma^{-2}$. It is shown that this synchrotron model is able
to reproduce the spectral shape between the infrared and soft X-rays and also
the corresponding luminosities for the Crab pulsar. In particular, the long
standing problem of the rapid spectral decline towards infrared frequencies is
understandable as emission at very small pitch angles from low energy particles
with $\gamma\ga 10$. It is also shown that the scaling of the synchrotron model
explains the observed correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the
spin-down luminosity of the neutron star $L_{\rm x} \sim 10^{-3} {\dot E}$.

limited when the source of work is mesoscopic, i.e. when its number of degrees
of freedom is large but finite. Here work-extraction from a single equilibrium
thermal bath is possible when its temperature is large enough. This result is
illustrated by means of exactly solvable models. Finally we consider the
Clausius principle: heat goes from high to low temperature. A theorem and some

thermodynamics for particle plus bath together, does not imply standard

second law are then invalid. First, the Clausius inequality can be violated.
Second, when the width of the confining potential is suddenly changed, there
occurs a relaxation to equilibrium during which the rate of entropy production

the critical point $x_{FC}$ at which the fermion condensation quantum phase
transition (FCQPT) occurs. Such behavior is of general form and takes place in
both three dimensional systems and two dimensional ones. We demonstrate that a
system which has undergone FCQPT and lies close to the critical point $x_{FC}$
can be driven back into the normal Fermi liquid by applying a small magnetic
field $B$. As the field $B$ is reduced, the system is tuned back to the
critical point and the effective mass diverges as $M^*\propto
1/\sqrt{B-B_{FC}}$ where $B_{FC}$ is the maximum field at which FCQPT takes
place. We demonstrate the constancy of the Kadowaki-Woods ratio when
approaching the critical point at the fields $B>B_{FC}$. Analyzing recent
experimental data on the effective mass behavior in a strongly correlated two
dimensional fluid $^3$He, in metallic two dimensional electron systems and in

Walker (FRW) equation in which the universe is flat, matter dominated, and
accelerating. Here we generalize the original Cardassian proposal to include
additional variants on the FRW equation. Specific examples are presented.
  In the ordinary FRW equation, the right hand side is a linear function of the
energy density, $H^2 \sim \rho$. Here, instead, the right hand side of the FRW
equation is a different function of the energy density, $H^2 \sim g(\rho)$.
This function returns to ordinary FRW at early times, but modifies the
expansion at a late epoch of the universe. The only ingredients in this
universe are matter and radiation: in particular, there is {\it no} vacuum
contribution. Currently the modification of the FRW equation is such that the
universe accelerates. The universe can be flat and yet consist of only matter
and radiation, and still be compatible with observations. The energy density
required to close the universe is much smaller than in a standard cosmology, so
that matter can be sufficient to provide a flat geometry. The modifications may
arise, e.g., as a consequence of our observable universe living as a
3-dimensional brane in a higher dimensional universe. The Cardassian model
survives several observational tests, including the cosmic background
radiation, the age of the universe, the cluster baryon fraction, and structure
formation. As will be shown in future work, the predictions for observational
tests of the generalized Cardassian models can be very different from generic
quintessence models, whether the equation of state is constant or time
dependent.

gauge theory of scale $\La\sim 10^{-6} M_p$ is lacking an explanation of the

fundamentally charged fermions of mass $m_F\sim 10^{-12} \La$, whose
approximate chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken during inflation, can cure
this shortcoming. The associated gas of weakly interacting pseudo
Nambu-Goldstone bosons (PNGB) undergoes Bose-Einstein (BE) condensation well
before the end of inflation. This causes the occurence of condensed light
scalar fields effectively acting as a curvaton. Fermions may also be charged
under a gauge group $G$ with a weak coupling $g$. Since fermions charged under
$SU(N_C)$ are confined after inflation the decay of Nambu-Goldstone bosons,
which reside in the condensates and in the PNGB radiation generated at
reheating, is mainly into fermions {\sl solely} charged under $G$. The
associated decay rate $\Gamma$ is estimated using PCAC and large $N_C$
counting. PNGB decay takes place during radiation domination after cosmological
scales have entered the horizon. Neglecting the effects of the spontaneous
breaking of G induced by the BE condensation, it is demonstrated that the
observed spectrum of spatial curvature perturbations $P^{1/2}_\xi\sim 5\times

almost degenerate superheavy right-handed neutrinos in a supersymmetric set up.
In this scenario a gauge singlet inflaton is directly coupled to the
right-handed (s)neutrinos with a mass heavier than the inflaton mass. This
helps avoiding potential problems which can naturally arise otherwise. The
inflaton decay to the Standard Model leptons and Higgs, via off-shell
right-handed (s)neutrinos, reheats the Universe. The same channel is also
responsible for generating the lepton asymmetry, thus requiring no stage of
preheating in order to excite superheavy (s)neutrinos. The suppressed decay
rate of the inflaton naturally leads to a sufficiently low reheat temperature,
which in addition, prevents any wash out of the yielded asymmetry. We will
particularly elaborate on important differences from leptogenesis with on-shell
(s)neutrinos. It is shown that for nearly degenerate neutrinos a successful
leptogenesis can be accommodated for a variety of inflationary models with a
rather wide ranging inflationary scale.

analog of wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) models, well known in media

second-harmonic components, and it is formulated in the spatial domain. We
demonstrate that the model supports both polychromatic solitons (PCSs), with
all the components present in them, and two types of mutually orthogonal simple
solitons, both types being stable in a broad parametric region. An essential
peculiarity of PCS is that its power is much smaller than that of a simple
(usual) soliton (taken at the same values of control parameters), which may be
an advantage for experimental generation of PCSs. Collisions between the
orthogonal simple solitons are simulated in detail, leading to the conclusion
that the collisions are strongly inelastic, converting the simple solitons into
polychromatic ones, and generating one or two additional PCSs. A collision
velocity at which the inelastic effects are strongest is identified, and it is
demonstrated that the collision may be used as a basis to design a simple

dependence of S-factors of astrophysically relevant two-body reactions. This is
accomplished by studying closely related three-body reactions under quasi-free
scattering conditions. The basic theory of the Trojan-Horse method is developed
starting from a post-form distorted wave Born approximation of the T-matrix
element. In the surface approximation the cross section of the three-body
reaction can be related to the S-matrix elements of the two-body reaction. The
essential feature of the Trojan-Horse method is the effective suppression of
the Coulomb barrier at low energies for the astrophysical reaction leading to
finite cross sections at the threshold of the two-body reaction. In a modified
plane wave approximation the relation between the two-body and three-body cross
sections becomes very transparent. The appearing Trojan-Horse integrals are
studied in detail.

together with conditions of absence of unphysical backward and kinematical

We have proposed physically more justified modified iteration procedure of
collisional damping calculation and demonstrated some results of damping
decrements calculations in a low-collision electron-ion plasma. Dispersion
smearing of both longitudinal and transversal high-frequency waves, for which
the smearing decrement \delta_x is proportional to
\Delta\omega/(\omega\sqrt{\omega^2-\omega_L^2}), might be the main cause of

to being minimum uncertainty states, as the size of the spin, S, increases, the
classical nature is seen to increase in two respects: in their resistance to
entanglement generation (when passed through a beam splitter) and in the
distinguishability of the states. In the infinite S limit the spin coherent
state is a subclass of the optical coherent states (namely the subclass of
orthogonal optical coherent states). These states generate no entanglement and
are obviously completely distinguishable. The decline of the generated
entanglement, and in this sense increase in classicality with S, is very slow
and dependent on the amplitude z of the state. Surprisingly we find that for
|z| > 1 there is an initial increase in entanglement followed by an extremely
gradual decline to zero. The distinguishability, on the other hand, quickly
becomes classical for all z. We illustrate the distinguishability of spin
coherent states in a novel manner using the representation of Majorana.
