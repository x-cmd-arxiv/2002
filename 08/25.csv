condition and the related decoupling assumption necessary for numerical
calculations, we shed some light on the way an inappropriate choice of the
boundary condition imposed at high density may adversely affect the numerical
results; we also discuss the problem of the partial differential equation
becoming stiff for close-to-critical and sub-critical temperatures. While
agreement of the theory's predictions with simulational and purely theoretical
studies of the square well system is generally satisfactory for lambda greater
than about 2, the combination of stiffness and the closure chosen is found to
render the critical point numerically inaccessible in the current formulation
of the theory for most of the systems with narrower wells. The mechanism
responsible for some deficiencies is illuminated at least partially and allows
us to conclude that the specific difficulties encountered for square wells are
not likely to resurface for continuous potentials.

small and the original prescription can give an unphysical scale. We give a
general method for computing an optimum scale numerically, within dimensional
regularization, and in cases when the coefficients of a series are known. We
apply it to the heavy quark mass and energy renormalization in lattice NRQCD,
and to a variety of known series. Among the latter, we find significant
corrections to the scales for the ratio of e+e- to hadrons over muons, the
ratio of the quark pole to MSbar mass, the semi-leptonic B-meson decay width,

terms of MSbar masses, increase by factors of five and thirteen, respectively,
substantially reducing the size of radiative corrections.

depends linearly with time, as it occurs, via the evolution of the inflaton, in

quantum to classical during the initial stages. This justifies the subsequent
use of real-time lattice simulations to describe the fully non-perturbative and
non-linear process of symmetry breaking. The early distribution of the Higgs
field is that of a smooth classical gaussian random field, and consists of
lumps whose shape and distribution is well understood analytically. The lumps
grow with time and develop into ``bubbles'' which eventually collide among
themselves, thus populating the high momentum modes, in their way towards
thermalization at the true vacuum. With the help of some approximations we are
able to provide a quasi-analytic understanding of this process.

states representing qubits. Considering a quantum system employed as an element
in a quantum computing scheme, the task is therefore to enforce the
pre-specified unitary transformation. This task is carried out by an external
time dependent field. Optimal control theory has been suggested as a method to
compute the external field which alters the evolution of the system such that
it performs the desire unitary transformation. This study compares two recent
implementations of optimal control theory to find the field that induces a
quantum gate. The first approach is based on the equation of motion of the
unitary transformation. The second approach generalizes the state to state
formulation of optimal control theory. This work highlight the formal relation
between the two approaches.
