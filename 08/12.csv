galaxies from the spectral energy distribution (SED) at wavelengths lambda
shorter than 100 microns. It is difficult to derive the total far-infrared
luminosity from only the IRAS data, though it is one of the most important
properties of galaxies. Observations by Infrared Telescope in Space (IRTS)
indicate that the SED of the diffuse emission from the Galactic plane in this
wavelength region can be derived from the 60 microns to 100 microns color. This
empirical SED relation was improved in order to obtain a better fit to the
Galactic plane data for I(60 microns)/I(100 microns) > 0.6, and applied to 96
IRAS galaxies for which ISOPHOT and KAO data are available at lambda > 100
microns. As a result, the empirical relation describes well the far-infrared
(FIR) SED for a majority of the galaxies. Additionally, the total FIR flux for
lambda longer than 40 microns is derived from the flux densities at 60 and 100
microns by using this model. For the 96 IRAS galaxies, the uncertainty in the
total far-infrared flux of the present method is 26%. The present method is
more accurate than the previous one widely used to derive the total infrared
flux from the IRAS 60 and 100 microns data.

providing the means to interpret astronomical data in the context of physical
and cosmological theory. In the current paradigm, our Universe has a flat
geometry, is undergoing accelerated expansion and is gravitationaly dominated
by elementary particles that make up cold dark matter. Within this framework,
it is possible to simulate in a computer the emergence of galaxies and other
structures from small quantum fluctuations imprinted during an epoch of
inflationary expansion shortly after the Big Bang. The simulations must take
into account the evolution of the dark matter as well as the gaseous processes
involved in the formation of stars and other visible components. Although many
unresolved questions remain, a coherent picture for the formation of cosmic
structure in now beginning to emerge. In this paper, I review a selection of
recent results obtained from simulations of the cosmic large-scale structure

caused by weak gravitational lensing. Previous studies have shown that for
shallow surveys with median redshifts z_m = 0.1, the intrinsic alignment
dominates the lensing signal. For deep surveys with z_m = 1, intrinsic
alignments are believed to be a significant contaminant of the lensing signal,
preventing high-precision measurements of the matter power spectrum. In this
paper we show how distance information, either spectroscopic or photometric
redshifts, can be used to down-weight nearby pairs in an optimised way, to
reduce the errors in the shear signal arising from intrinsic alignments.
Provided a conservatively large intrinsic alignment is assumed, the optimised
weights will essentially remove all traces of contamination. For the Sloan
spectroscopic galaxy sample, residual shot noise continues to render it
unsuitable for weak lensing studies. However, a dramatic improvement for the
slightly deeper Sloan photometric survey is found, whereby the intrinsic
contribution, at angular scales greater than 1 arcminute, is reduced from about
80 times the lensing signal to a 10% effect. For deeper surveys such as the
COMBO-17 survey with z_m = 0.6, the optimisation reduces the error from a
largely systematic 220% error at small angular scales to a much smaller and
largely statistical error of only 17% of the expected lensing signal. We
therefore propose that future weak lensing surveys be accompanied by the
acquisition of photometric redshifts, in order to remove fully the unknown
intrinsic alignment errors from weak lensing detections.

three low redshift objects have the colors of normal galaxies and apparently
the light is dominated by stars. This could be due to the extinction of the
underlying nuclear continuum by the same matter that absorbs X-rays and/or due
to the dilution of the central source by starlight. These results suggest that

the KPZ-coupling found at 1-loop order extends beyond the leading one. Using a
Cole-Hopf-transformed theory we argue that it is indeed uncorrected to all

A careful analysis of the flow yields several non-trivial fixed points. All
these fixed points are transient since they possess one unstable direction
towards a runaway flow, which leaves open the question of the upper critical
dimension. The runaway flow is dominated by a Landau-ghost-mode. For SR
elasticity, using the Cole-Hopf transformed theory we identify a non-trivial

SiC doping level remained rather small due to the counterbalanced effect of Si

intra-grain defects and nano-inclusions, which act as effective pinning
centers, resulting in a substantial enhancement in the Jc(H) performance. The
transport Jc for all the wires is comparable to the magnetic Jc at higher
fields despite the low density of the samples and percolative nature of
current. The transport Ic for the 10wt% SiC doped MgB2/Fe reached 660A at 5K
and 4.5T (Jc = 133,000A/cm2) and 540A at 20K and 2T (Jc = 108,000A/cm2). The

magnitude higher than for the state-the-art Fe-sheathed MgB2 wire reported to
date at 5K and 10T and 20K and 5T respectively. There is a plenty of room for
further improvement in Jc as the density of the current samples is only 50%.

method for description of the many-body quasi-particle dynamics of correlated

solved using self-consistent iterations method. Empirical fits to the peak
positions of the distributions from iteration method have been obtained for
bremsstrahlung and annihilation with scattering (AWS) processes. The
variational approach for f(p) calculation has been simplified considerably
making some assumptions. Using this method, the photon emission rates at finite
baryon density have been estimated. The LPM suppression factors for
bremsstrahlung and annihilation with scattering (AWS) processes have been
obtained as a function of photon energy and baryon density. The effect of
baryon density has been shown to be rather weak and the suppression factors are
similar to the zero density case. The suppression factors for AWS processes can
be taken at zero density, whereas the bremsstrahlung suppression can be taken
at zero density multiplied by a density dependent factor.

particular and for the T^4 case, we identify both massive and massless
oscillators on the pp-wave, with certain classes of excited states in the
resolved CFT carrying large R-charge n. For the former, the excited states
involve fractional modes of the generators of the N=4 chiral algebra acting on
the Z_n ground states. For the latter, they involve, fractional modes of the

to the conformal dimensions of the first class of states, due to the presence
of the blowing up mode. We find agreement, to this order, with the
corresponding spectrum of massive oscillators on the pp-wave. We also discuss
the issue of higher order corrections.
