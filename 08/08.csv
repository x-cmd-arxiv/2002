the recent expansion history, at which Type Ia supernovae have proved adept. We
examine here the depth of survey necessary to provide a precise and
qualitatively complete description of dark energy. Realistic analysis of

removing the contribution due to beam smearing, the intrinsic clustering of the

form (3.6 +- 0.9) x 10^{-4} theta^{-1} where theta is measured in degrees. If
current AGN models of the hard XRB are reasonable and the cosmological
constant-cold dark matter cosmology is correct, this clustering implies an
X-ray bias factor of b_X ~ 2. Combined with the absence of a correlation
between the XRB and the cosmic microwave background, this clustering can be
used to limit the presence of an integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect and
thereby to constrain the value of the cosmological constant, Omega_Lambda <
0.60 (95 % C.L.). This constraint is inconsistent with much of the parameter
space currently favored by other observations. Finally, we marginally detect
the dipole moment of the diffuse XRB and find it to be consistent with the
dipole due to our motion with respect to the mean rest frame of the XRB. The
limit on the amplitude of any intrinsic dipole is delta I / I < 5 x 10^{-3} at
the 95 % C.L. When compared to the local bulk velocity, this limit implies a
constraint on the matter density of the universe of Omega_m^{0.6}/b_X(0) >

obtained 4 months apart, with no significant change in the other (6.21, 6.4,
and 6.97 keV) Fe K_alpha line components. During this time, the continuum flux
decreased by ~20%. The RXTE spectrum requires an Fe K absorption edge near 8.6
keV (Fe XXIII - XXV). The spectral data indicate that the 2-10 keV continuum
emission is dominated (~2/3 of the luminosity) by reflection from a previously
unidentified region of warm, ionized gas located <~ 0.2 pc from the AGN. The
remaining ~1/3 of the observed X-ray emission is reflected from optically
thick, neutral gas. The inferred properties of the warm reflector (WR) are:
size (diameter) <~0.2 pc, gas density n >~ 10^{5.5} /cm3, ionization parameter
xi approx 10^{3.5} erg cm/s, and covering fraction 0.003 (L_0/10^{43.5}

intrinsic 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity of the AGN. We suggest that the WR gas is
the source of the (variable) 6.7 keV Fe line emission, and the 6.97 keV Fe line
emission. The 6.7 keV line flare is assumed to be due to an increase in the
emissivity of the WR gas from a decrease (by 20-30%) in L_0. The properties of
the WR are most consistent with an intrinsically X-ray weak AGN with L_0 approx
10^{43.0} erg/s. The optical and UV emission that scatters from the WR into our
line of sight is required to suffer strong extinction, which can be reconciled
if the line-of-sight skims the outer surface of the torus. Thermal
bremsstrahlung radio emission from the WR may be detectable in VLBA radio maps
of the NGC 1068 nucleus.

al., and of another very recent study of Sarajedini et al. (2002) obtained from
K-band photometry. However, we emphasize that current model predictions about
the uncertainties of population corrections seem to indicate that errors up to
about 0.12 mag may be possible, probably in any photometric band. Therefore,
work must continue to tighten the constraints on these corrections. We also
determine the mean red clump star magnitude in our LMC fields in the J band,
which could be a useful alternative to the K band should future work reveal
that population effect corrections for red clump stars in the J band are

The source is a shell or composite, and continues to show a complex morphology
with large brightness modulations along the ridge and with protrusions. The
supernova is moderately to strongly decelerated. The average outer radius
expands as t^(0.71 +/- 0.11), and the expansion velocity has slowed to 6000
km/s at t=15.9 yr from an extrapolated 20,000 km/s at t=0.25 yr. The structure
changes significantly with time, showing that the evolution is not
self-similar. The shell structure is best visible at the latest epoch, when the
protrusions have diminished somewhat in prominence and a new, compact component
has appeared. The radio spectrum shows a clear inversion above 10 GHz. This
might be related to a pulsar nebula becoming visible through the debris of the
explosion. The radio flux density between 1.5 and 23 GHz decreases strongly
with time, with the flux density proportional to t^(-2.94 +/- 0.24) between

a possible solution for XTE J0929-314, though I will show that evolutionary
arguments make a hot WD more likely. In addition to being larger than the T=0

mass for a fixed core temperature. If they remain hot as they lose mass and
expand, they can ``evaporate'' to leave an isolated millisecond radio pulsar.
They also adiabatically expand upon mass loss at a rate faster than the growth
of the Roche radius if the angular momentum deposited in the disk is not
returned to the donor. If the timescale of the resulting runaway mass transfer
is shorter than the viscous timescale in the outer disk, then the mass transfer
instability of Ruderman and Shaham for He WDs would be realized. However, my
estimates of these timescales still makes the instability unlikely for
adiabatic responses. I close by noting the possible impact of finite T WDs on

110GHz. We clearly detect a binary source separated by about 1 arcsec in the
east-west direction in the 342GHz continuum. The CO J=3-2 visibility
amplitudes, however, indicate a more complicated structure, with evidence for a
compact binary at some velocities and rather more extended structure at others.
Less than 30% of the total CO J=3-2 emission is detected by the interferometer,
which implies the presence of significant quantities of extended gas. We also
obtained single-dish CO J=2-1, CO J=3-2 and HCN J=4-3 spectra. The HCN J=4-3

on the absorber or its location in the optical galaxy. In addition, doubts
remain about the relationship of the AGN to the optical galaxy given the
observed lack of re-emitted radiation. We present new HST, ASCA and VLBA
observations which throw significant new light on these issues. The HST
observations reveal an extrremely red color (V-H = 6.9 mag) for the active
nucleus of PKS 1413+135, requiring both a spectral turnover at a few microns
due to synchrotron aging and a GMC-sized absorber. We derive an intrinsic
column N_H = 4.6^{+2.1}_{-1.6} times 10^{22}cm^{-2} and covering fraction f =
0.12^{+0.07}_{-0.05}. As the GMC is likely in the disk of the optical galaxy,
our sightline is rather unlikely (P ~ 2 times 10^{-4}). The properties of the
GMC typical of GMCs in our own galaxy. The HI absorber appears centered 25
milliarcseconds away from the nucleus, while the X-ray and nearly all of the
molecular absorbers must cover the nucleus, implying a complicated geometry and
cloud structure, with a molecular core along our line of sight to the nucleus.
Interestingly, the HST/NICMOS data require the AGN to be decentered relative to
the optical galaxy by 13 +/- 4 milliarcseconds. This could be interpreted as
suggestive of an AGN location far in the background compared to the optical
galaxy, but it can also be explained by obscuration and/or nuclear structure,
which is more consistent with the observed lack of multiple images.

has previously been used to predict their level of high-energy (GeV - TeV)
emission. In this paper, we point out that such spectral fitting can have very
large uncertainties with respect to predictions of the VHE emission. This is
demonstrated with the example of W Comae. We show that the best currently
available contemporaneous optical - X-ray spectrum of W Comae still allows for
a large range of possible parameters, resulting in drastically different > 40
GeV fluxes. We find that all acceptable leptonic-model fits to the optical -
X-ray emission of W Comae predict a cut-off of the high-energy emission around
~ 100 GeV. We suggest that detailed measurements and analysis of the soft X-ray
variability of W Comae may be used to break the degeneracy in the choice of
possible fit parameters, and thus allow a more reliable prediction of the VHE
emission from this object. Using the available soft X-ray variability measured
by BeppoSAX, we predict a > 40 GeV flux from W Comae of ~ (0.4 - 1) * 10^{-10}
photons/(cm^2 s) with no significant emission at E > 100 GeV for a leptonic jet
model. We compare our results concerning leptonic jet models with detailed
predictions of the hadronic Synchrotron-Proton Blazar model. This hadronic
model predicts > 40 GeV fluxes very similar to those found for the leptonic
models, but results in > 100 GeV emission which should be clearly detectable
with future high-sensitivity instruments like VERITAS. Thus, we suggest this
object as a promising target for VHE gamma-ray and co-ordinated broadband
observations to distinguish between leptonic and hadronic jet models for

  Francisco: ASP)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Massive stars evolve across the HR diagram, losing mass along the way and
forming a variety of ring nebulae. During the main sequence stage, the fast
stellar wind sweeps up the ambient interstellar medium to form an interstellar
bubble. After a massive star evolves into a red giant or a luminous blue
variable, it loses mass copiously to form a circumstellar nebula. As it evolves
further into a WR star, the fast WR wind sweeps up the previous mass loss and
forms a circumstellar bubble. Observations of ring nebulae around massive stars
not only are fascinating, but also are useful in providing templates to
diagnose the progenitors of supernovae from their circumstellar nebulae. In
this review, I will summarize the characteristics of ring nebulae around
massive stars throughout the HR diagram, show recent advances in X-ray
observations of bubble interiors, and compare supernovae's circumstellar
nebulae with known types of ring nebulae around massive stars.

  obscure latex reasons. Submitted to A&A",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss magnetic pressure and density fluctuations in strongly turbulent
isothermal MHD flows in ""1+2/3"" dimensions. We first consider ""simple""
nonlinear MHD waves, which allow us show that the slow and fast modes have
different asymptotic dependences of the magnetic pressure B^2 vs. rho. For the
slow mode, B^2 ~= c_1-c_2 rho, while for the fast mode, B^2 ~= rho^2. We also
perform a perturbative analysis to investigate Alfven wave pressure, recovering
previous results that B^2 ~= rho^gamma_e, with gamma_e ~= 2, 3/2 and 1/2 at
respectively large, moderate and low M_a. This variety of scalings implies that
a single polytropic description of magnetic pressure is not possible in
general, since the relation between B^2 and rho depends on which mode dominates
the density fluctuation production, which in turn depends on the angle between
the magnetic field and the direction of wave propagation, and on the Alfvenic
Mach number M_a. Typically, at small M_a, the slow mode dominates, and B is
ANTIcorrelated with rho. At large M_a, both modes contribute to density
fluctuation production, and the magnetic pressure decorrelates from density,
exhibiting a large scatter, which however decreases towards higher densities.
In this case, the unsystematic behavior of the magnetic pressure causes the
density PDF to generally maintain the lognormal shape corresponding to
non-magnetic isothermal turbulence, except when the slow mode dominates, in
which case the PDF develops an excess at low densities. Our results are
consistent with the low values and apparent lack of correlation between the
magnetic field strength and density in surveys of the lower-density molecular
gas, and also with the recorrelation apparently seen at higher densities, if
M_a is relatively large there.

earlier results of Paper 1 that inclusion of alpha-enhancement effects further
reduces the age estimates of globular clusters by approximately 8 percent if

change in age estimates (larger age reductions in lower metallicities). This
reduces the age gap between the oldest metal-rich and metal-poor Galactic
stellar populations and between the halo and the disk populations. The

characterized by Ho=58. While the random error is small (+-2), it may still be
affected by systematic errors as large as 10%. The local expansion is outlined
by Cepheids and by Cepheid-calibrated TF distances of a complete sample of
field galaxies and by nearby groups and clusters; the cosmic expansion is
defined by Cepheid-calibrated SNeIa. The main source of systematic errors are
therefore the shape and the zero point of the P-L relation of Cepheids and its
possible dependence on metallicity. GAIA will essentially eliminate these error
sources. Another source of systematic error is due to the homogenization of
SNeIa as to decline rate Delta m_15 and color (B-V). GAIA will discover about
half of the 2200 SNeIa which will occur during a four-year lifetime within
10000kms. For many of them ground-based follow-up will provide useful
photometric parameters (and spectra), which will allow to fix the dependence of
the SNeIa luminosity on Delta m_15 and (B-V) with high accuracy. At the same
time they will yield exquisite distances to an corresponding number of field
galaxies. - GAIA will also revolutionize the very local distance scale by
determining fundamental distances of the companion galaxies of the Milky Way
and even of some spirals in- and possibly outside the Local Group from their
rotation curves seen in radial velocities and proper motions. Moreover, GAIA
will obtain trigonometric parallaxes of RR Lyrae stars, of red giants defining
the TRGB, of stars on the ZAMS, of White Dwarf defining their cooling sequence,
and of globular clusters, and determine the metallicity dependence of these
distance indicators. It will thus establish a self-controlling network of

are 1.7-4.8E-12 erg / cm2 s. The absorption is in the range N_H=0.5-6.7E22 /

thus have L_x > 2-5E34 erg/s (2-10 keV). A powerlaw with photon index 1.1-1.8
generally gives a fair fit, but a strong iron line (at 6-7 keV) is evident for
5 sources and exists at lower confidence in the others. The fits indicate
differences in line position in the range 6.1-7.0 keV suggesting that the
ionisation state and/or emission mechanism may not be the same in all sources.
The time-binned data indicates that two sources are variable on a time scale of
hours at confidence > 99.99%, and one at 99.67%. These sources could be
low-mass X-ray binaries. The other sources are most probably X-ray binaries or

with only residual emission and no point sources yielded spectral parameters

azimuthal one. The average pitch angle of the magnetic field is about
20$\degr$, similar to galaxies with a well-defined spiral pattern. This
provides support for field generation by a turbulent dynamo without significant
``contamination'' from streaming motions in spiral arms. While the stellar
light is very axisymmetric, the magnetic field structure shows a clear
asymmetry with a stronger regular field and a smaller magnetic pitch angle in
the northern disk. Extremely strong Faraday rotation is measured in the
southern part of the disk, becoming Faraday thick at 6cm. The distribution of
Faraday rotation suggests a mixture of axisymmetric and higher-mode magnetic
fields. The strong Faraday effects in the southern region suggest a much
thicker magnetoionic disk and a higher content of diffuse ionized gas than in
the northern disk portion. An elongation of the 20cm total power emission is
also seen towards the South. Although NGC 4414 is currently an isolated spiral,
the asymmetries in the polarized radio emission may be sensitive tracers of
previous encounters, including weak interactions which would chiefly affect the
diffuse gas component without generating obvious long-term perturbations in the
optical structure.

broadly consistent with recent measurements made at similar fluxes with ASCA

absorbed sources are broad line objects, though with moderate column densities.
Two sources in the sample are X-ray bright optically quiet galaxies and show

distribution of surviving planets after disk dissipation, for various disk
masses, lifetimes, viscosities, and initial planet masses. The majority of
planets migrate too fast and are destroyed via mass transfer onto the central
star. Most surviving planets have relatively large orbital semi-major axes of
several AU or larger. We conclude that the extrasolar planets observed to date,
particularly those with small semi-major axes, represent only a small fraction
(~25% to 33%) of a larger cohort of giant planets around solar-type stars, and
many undetected giant planets must exist at large (>1-2 AU) distances from
their parent stars. As sensitivity and completion of the observed sample
increases with time, this distant majority population of giant planets should
be revealed. We find that the current distribution of extrasolar giant planet
masses implies that high mass (more than 1-2 Jupiter masses) giant planet
formation must be relatively rare. Finally, our simulations imply that the
efficiency of giant planet formation must be high: at least 10% and perhaps as
many as 80% of solar-type stars possess giant planets during their pre-main
sequence phase. These predictions, including those for pre-main sequence stars,

The ballistic quantum dots possess a mixed classical phase space, where regular

by an amount which varies with the positions of the leads. This suppression is
due to the deterministic nature of transport through regular regions and along
short chaotic trajectories, and disappears by increasing the scattering rate,
which is incorporated by using the Poisson kernel of random matrix theory.

we expect by the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer that the arithmetic
rank of each of these curves E_D is odd, and therefore positive. We prove that
E_D has positive rank for each D such that |D| is in one of the above
congruence classes mod 8 and also satisfies |D|<10^6. Our proof is
computational: we use the modular parametrization of E_1 or E_2 to construct a
rational point P_D on each E_D from CM points on modular curves, and compute
P_D to enough accuracy to usually distinguish it from any of the rational
torsion points on E_D. In the 1375 cases in which we cannot numerically
distinguish P_D from a torsion point of E_D, we surmise that P_D is in fact a
torsion point but that E_D has rank 3, and prove that the rank is positive by
searching for and finding a non-torsion rational point. We also report on the
conjectural extension to |D|<10^7 of the list of curves E_D whose analytic rank
is odd and greater than 1, which raises several new questions.

Grauert in his celebrated article 1962. In that article he considers a manifold
X and a negatively embedded submanifold A subset X. He introduces
n-neighborhood, n in N, of A and studies when an isomorphism of two
n-neighborhoods can be extended to an isomorphism of (n+1)-neighborhoods. He
observes that obstructions to this extension problem lie in the first
cohomology group of certain sheaves involving the normal bundle of A in X.
Using a version of Kodaira vanishing theorem he shows that for a large n these
cohomology groups vanish and so he concludes that the germ of a negatively
embedded manifold A depends only on a finite neighborhood of it. These methods
are generalized to a germ of an arbitrary negatively embedded divisor A by
Hironaka, Rossi and Laufer. In the case where A is a Riemann surface embedded
in a two dimensional manifold, by using Serre duality we can say exactly which
finite neighborhood of A determines the embedding.
  This isa first draft of an expository article about negatively embedded
varieties. The text is mainly based on Grauert's paper, but we have used also
the contributions of subsequent authors; for instance the Artin's criterion on
the existence of convergent solutions is used instead of Grauert's geometrical
methods. Our principal aim is to extend this study to the germ of foliated
neighborhoods and singularities. In the first steps we will consider the most
simple foliations which are transversal foliations. Next, foliations with

the kinematic (linear) approximation gives an unbounded exponential growth of
the long wavelength part of the magnetic fields. Here we, in a systematic
diagrammatic, perturbation theory, show how non-linear effects suppress the
linear instability and bring down the growth rate to zero in the large time
limit. We work with diffferent background velicity spectrum and initial
magnetic field correlations. Our results indicate the robustness and very
general nature of dynamo growth: It is qualitatively independent of the
background velicty and intial magnetic field spectra. We also argue that our
results can be justified within the framework of the first order smoothing
approximation, as applicable for the full non-linear problem. We discuss our
results from the view points of renormalisation group analysis.

golden rule regime to the perturbation-independent exponential decay regime by
using the kicked top model. It is shown that the deviation of the
perturbation-independent decay of the averaged fidelity from the Lyapunov decay
results from quantum fluctuations in individual fidelity, which are caused by
the coherence in the initial coherent states.
  With an averaging procedure suppressing the quantum fluctuations effectively,
the perturbation-independent decay is found to be close to the Lyapunov decay.
  We also show that the Fourier transform of the fidelity is determined
directly by the initial state and the eigenstates of the Floquet operators of
the two classically chaotic systems concerned.
  The absolute value part and the phase part of the Fourier transform of the
fidelity are found to be divided into several correlated parts, which is a
manifestation of the coherence of the initial coherent state.
  In the whole crossover region, some important properties of the fidelity,
such as the exponent of its exponential decay and the short initial time within
which the fidelity almost does not change, are found to be closely related to
properties of the central part of its Fourier transform.

owls forced to wear prismatic spectacles that shift their visual field.
Adaptive behavior in young owls is accompanied by a compensating shift in the

of such neurons by linear filters that sample correlated audio-visual signals,
and search for filters that maximize the gathered information, while subject to
the costs of rewiring neurons. Assuming a higher fidelity of visual
information, we find that the corresponding receptive fields are robust and
unchanged by artificial shifts. The shape of the aural receptive field,
however, is controlled by correlations between sight and sound. In response to
prismatic glasses, the aural receptive fields shift in the compensating
direction, although their shape is modified due to the costs of rewiring.

quantum mind advocates proposed experiments based on the assumption that the

preserved through the neural processing, or in other words they suppose that
photons collapse not in the retina, but in the brain cortex. In this paper we
show that photons do collapse within the retina and subsequent processing of
information at the level of neural membranes proceeds. Moreover, we explicitly
stress on the fact that due to existent amplification of the signal produced by
each photon, a basic quantum mechanical theorem forbids the photon state to be
teleported from the retina to the brain cortex. The changes of the membrane
potential of the neurons in the primary visual cortex are shown to be relevant
to inputting visual sensory information that is already processed and is not
identical to the visual image entering in the retina. A striking evidence for
the existent processing of the incoming visual information by the retina is
provided by visual illusions resulting from the lateral inhibition mechanism.
