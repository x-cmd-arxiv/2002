The first 500 m contribute 60% to the total seeing, the free-atmosphere median

0.15 arcseconds because there is always some turbulence above 12 km. A 4-day

arcseconds was noted. A gain in resolution from adaptive compensation of ground
layer will be 1.7 times typically and 2-3 times during such calm periods.
Correlations of the free-atmosphere turbulence with the wind speed at
tropopause and of the ground-layer turbulence with ground wind are studied.
Temporal evolution of turbulence is characterized by recurrent bursts, their
typical duration increases from 15 minutes in low layers to 1-2 hours in high
layers. The large data base of turbulence profiles can be used to test
meso-scale modeling of astronomical seeing.

and photon spectra resulting from nonthermal processes at the shock fronts
formed in merging clusters of galaxies. Fermi acceleration is approximated by
injecting power-law distributions of particles during a merger event, subject
to constraints on maximum particle energies. We consider synchrotron,
bremsstrahlung, Compton, and Coulomb processes for the electrons, nuclear,
photomeson, and Coulomb processes for the protons, and knock-on electron
production during the merging process. The broadband radio through gamma-ray
emission radiated by nonthermal protons and primary and secondary electrons is
calculated both during and after the merger event. Using ROSAT observations to
establish typical parameters for the matter density profile of clusters of
galaxies, we find that typical merger shocks are weak and accelerate particles
with relatively soft spectra. We consider the prospects for detecting
nonthermal radio and gamma-ray emission from clusters of galaxies and
implications for the origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and the diffuse
gamma-ray background. Our results suggest that only a few of the
isotropically-distributed unidentified EGRET sources are due to shocks formed
in cluster mergers, and that only a minor contribution to the diffuse
extragalactic gamma-ray background can originate from cluster merger shocks.
Cluster merger shocks can accelerate protons to $\lesssim 10^{19}$ eV for the
standard parameters considered here. We predict that {\it GLAST} will detect
several cluster mergers and, depending on the mean magnetic fields in the
intracluster medium, the Low Frequency Array could detect anywhere from several
to several hundred.

photometric redshift indicator and demonstrate that the technique holds promise
by successfully recovering the redshifts of a small sample of z=0-1 galaxies
using only their infrared (JHKL) photometry. I then consider the applicability
of the technique to the 3.6--8um SIRTF filter set and investigate the
systematic errors that could arise in photometric redshifts from random
photometric errors or from a mismatch between target galaxies and fitting
templates in metallicity, star formation history, and amount of interstellar
dust. It appears that SIRTF near-IR data alone should be sufficient to estimate
redshift of most galaxies that are at z>~1.5 and are dominated by stellar
populations older than >~20Myr. Galaxies whose photometric fits indicate them
to be at lower redshifts, z_fit<~1.5, or dominated by very young stellar
populations, age_fit<~20Myr, suffer from severe degeneracies in photometric
redshift, and a reliable photometric determination of their redshifts will have
to include either IR observations at shorter wavelengths (H and K) or optical
data. Overall, it appears that - with care and caveats - the 1.6um bump can
provide a powerful way of estimating redshifts of distant galaxies in deep
infrared imaging surveys that will soon be provided by SIRTF, and, eventually,

regions of the sky. We combine the K-band magnitudes of the 7CRS radio galaxies
with those from the 3CRR, 6CE and 6C* samples to investigate the nature of the
relationship between K-magnitude and redshift and whether there is any
dependence upon radio luminosity. We find that radio galaxies appear to belong
to a homogeneous population which formed the bulk of their stars at high
redshifts (z_f>5) and evolved passively from then until they reach a mean
present-day luminosity of 3L*. We find a significant difference between the
K-magnitudes of the 7CRS and 3CRR radio galaxies with the 7CRS galaxies being
\~0.55 mag fainter at all redshifts. The cause of this weak correlation between
stellar and radio luminosities probably lies in mutual correlations of these
properties with the central black hole mass. We compare the evolution-corrected
host luminosities at a constant radio luminosity and find that the typical host
luminosity (mass) increases by approximately 1L* from z~2 to z~0.5 which,
although a much smaller factor than predicted by semi-analytic models of galaxy
formation, is in line with results on optically-selected quasars. Our study has
therefore revealed that the small dispersion in stellar luminosity of radio
galaxies around 3L* includes subtle but significant differences between the
host galaxies of extreme- and moderate-power radio sources at fixed redshift,
and between those of high- and low-redshift radio sources at fixed radio
luminosity.

their K-band luminosity functions. This is consistent with what have been found
in optical type dependent luminosity function. The K-band luminosity density
derived using our luminosity function is now measured at a similar redshift
depth to optical luminosity densities in the SDSS redshift survey. It is 2

ACIS stowed outside the focal area showed that the dark Moon does not emit
significantly in our band. Point sources down to 3 10^-16 erg/s/cm2 in the

the diffuse signal varies strongly from field to field and contributes between
55% and 90% of the total CXB signal. It is dominated by emission lines that can
be modeled by a kT=0.1-0.4 keV plasma. In particular, the two fields located
away from bright Galactic features show a prominent line blend at E=580 eV (O

this morphological property is similar to that of hot plasma probed by soft

form of a dense, clumpy ridge surrounded by more extended diffuse HI containing
a few additional discrete features, such as a Western HI Arm and an HI bridge
reaching out to a small counterrotating companion cloud. About 10% by mass of
all HI in NGC 1569 is at unusually high velocities. Some of this HI may be
associated with the mass outflow evident from H-alpha measurements, but some
may also be associated with NGC 1569's HI companion and intervening HI bridge,
in which case, infall rather than outflow might be the cause of the discrepant
velocities. No indication of a large bubble structure was found in
position-velocity maps of the high-velocity HI. The galaxy as a whole is in
modest overall rotation, but the HI gas lacks any sign of rotation within 60''

turbulent motions resulting from the starburst appear to dominate over
rotation. In the outer disk, the rotational velocities reach a maximum of 35

The overall redshift distribution N(z) for the K'<21.0 sample is consistent
with previous observations, and for the first time we derive the N(z) down to
K'=24.0. After taking account of the dust extinction and selection effects of
the sample, the observed N(z) distribution is well described with the PLE
model, while the hierarchical galaxy formation model shows an apparent
deficiency of galaxies especially at z>2. The photometric redshift and the
best-fit SED model evaluations allow the derivation of the rest-frame K', B,
and UV(2000A) luminosity functions (LFs) and their evolutions. The rest-K' LF
shows almost no evolution up to z=3, while the rest B LF shows mild luminosity
evolution, and the rest UV LF shows strong luminosity evolution. This trend
corresponds to the evolution of the rest UV-K' color, which gets bluer with
increasing redshift. We also found that more massive galaxies are redder in
this rest-frame color in every epoch. The rest-UV LF of our K'-selected
galaxies shows a much shallower faint end slope at z=3 than that of previous
estimations for rest-UV selected Lyman break galaxies. As a consequence, the
contribution to the global star formation rate of our K'-selected galaxies is
about 42% of that derived from the integration of LF of Lyman break galaxies at
z=3. This result suggests that a large fraction of the star formation rate
density at z>1.5 comes from the contribution from the faint (M_2000A>-20) blue
galaxy population at high redshift universe that have not yet obviously been

For $q$ sufficiently well above that needed for the convection onset, the
transient $\Delta T(t)$ for a given $\epsilon\equiv(T-T_c)/T_c$, with $T_c$ =
3.318K, shows a damped oscillatory profile with period $t_{osc}$ modulating a
smooth base profile. The smooth profile forms the exponential tail of the
transient which tends to the steady-state $\Delta T(\infty)$ with a time
constant $\tau_{tail}$. The scaled times $t_{osc}/t_D$ and $\tau_{tail}/t_D$
from all the data could be collapsed onto two curves as a function of the
Rayleigh number over $\sim$ 3.5 decades. Here $t_D$ is the characteristic
thermal diffusion time. Furthermore comparisons are made between measurements
of a third characteristic time $t_m$ between the first peak and the first

weakly-interacting Bose gases in three dimensions is known to be related to
certain non-universal properties of the phase transition of three-dimensional
O(2) symmetric $\phi^4$ theory. These properties have been measured previously
in Monte Carlo lattice simulations. They have also been approximated
analytically, with moderate success, by large $N$ approximations to O($N$)
symmetric $\phi^4$ theory. To begin investigating the region of validity of the
large $N$ approximation in this application, I have applied the same Monte
Carlo technique developed for the O(2) model ([5]) to O(1) and O(4) theories.
My results indicate that there might exist some theoretically unanticipated
systematic errors in the extrapolation of the continuum value from lattice
Monte Carlo results. The final results show that the difference between
simulations and NLO large $N$ calculations does not improve significantly from
N=2 to N=4. This suggests one would need to simulate yet larger $N$'s to see
true large $N$ scaling of the difference. Quite unexpectedly (and presumably
accidentally), my Monte Carlo result for N=1 seems to give the best agreement
with the large $N$ approximation among the three cases.

condensates are created along the flat directions because of inflationary

can charge up the condensate with B or L in a process known as Affleck-Dine
baryogenesis. Condensate fluctuations can give rise to both adiabatic and
isocurvature density perturbations and could be observable in future cosmic
microwave experiments. In many cases the condensate is however not the state of
lowest energy but fragments, with many interesting cosmological consequences.
Fragmentation is triggered by inflation-induced perturbations and the
condensate lumps will eventually form non-topological solitons, known as
Q-balls. Their properties depend on how supersymmetry breaking is transmitted
to the MSSM; if by gravity, then the Q-balls are semi-stable but long-lived and
can be the source of all the baryons and LSP dark matter; if by gauge
interactions, the Q-balls can be absolutely stable and form dark matter that
can be searched for directly. We also discuss some cosmological applications of
generic flat directions and Q-balls in the context of self-interacting dark
matter, inflatonic solitons and extra dimensions.

magnetic field on the flow. For small magnetic diffusivity, in the early stage
of evolution, there is an ideal phase where dissipative effects can also be
neglected. We estimate the magnitude of the energy dissipation term (Ohmic
heating), taking into account differential constraints on chaotic flows. We
find that the period of ideal evolution is roughly doubled over an estimate
without constraints. The helicity generation terms are exponentially smaller
than the energy dissipation, so that large quantities of energy are dissipated
before any helicity can be created. Helicity flow is exponentially larger than
net helicity generation. The constraints also lead to the existence of a
singular initial condition for the magnetic field for which sizable amounts of
helicity can potentially be created.

the yield due to the jet-plasma interaction gets progressively larger as the
collision energy increases. We find it to be negligible at SPS energies, of the
order of the Drell-Yan contribution and much larger than the normal thermal
yield at RHIC energies and up to a factor of ten larger than the Drell-Yan
contribution at LHC energies. An observation of this new dilepton source would
confirm the occurrence of jet-plasma interactions and of conditions suitable
for jet-quenching to take place.

type groups and are covariant under the (extended) Poincar\'{e} group and
charge conjugation, where the charge conjugation operation is defined as an
automorphism on U(N,N) elements. The currents are also required to satisfy
current conservation, hermiticity, and locality. The condition that the
currents be local is shown to be equivalent to certain integral constraints on
form factors. These constraints are satisfied by writing the currents in terms
of free local spin $j$ fields. It is shown that there are $(2j+1)$ different
local currents for a spin $j$ particle, each with an arbitrary form factor,
generalizing the Dirac and Pauli currents for spin 1/2 particles. Static
properties of the various currents are also given.

the model is that the mixing amplitude is generated by nucleon and anti-nucleon
loops and hence driven entirely by the difference between proton and neutron
Fermi momenta and the proton-neutron mass difference. We find that the behavior
of the mixing amplitude is very complicated in the spacelike region and quite
sensitive to the proton fraction of nuclear medium and nuclear density. In
particular, in neutron rich nuclei (like Pb) and/or neutron stars the mixing
amplitudes become about 10 $\sim$ 100 times as large as those in typical mirror
nuclei.

  Technogoly, ebeam 2002",,,,"physics.plasm-ph physics.gen-ph",,"  Pyroelectric crystals are used to produce self-focused electron beams with
energies greater than 170 keV. No high voltage power supply or electron gun is
needed. The system works by simply changing the temperature of a crystal of
LiNbO3 or LiTaO3 by about 100oC in dilute gas. Electron beam energy spectra as
well as positive-ion-beam energy spectra and profiles are shown. A change in
the crystal temperature of 100oC will cause a spontaneous change in
polarization. The change in polarization will be manifested by a change in
charge on the surface of the crystal. It is this uncompensated charge that
produces the electric field, which accelerates the electrons, or the positive
ions and gives rise to the plasma, which in turn focuses them. The source of
the accelerated electrons or positive ions is gas molecules ionized near the
crystal surface. When the crystal surface is negative electrons are accelerated
away from it and positive ions are attracted to the surface. These positive
ions reduce the net negative charge on the surface thereby reducing the
electric field, which causes the electron energy to decrease over time even
though the focal properties remain unchanged. When the surface is positive the
reverse obtains and the positive ion beam energy decreases over time as well.
We will present video clips, photographic and electronic data that demonstrate
many of the characteristics and applications of these electron beams.

that a statement in IGHSC analysis concerning the existence of isochore is
incorrect, because it had applied an inappropriate statistical test. To test
the existence of isochores should be equivalent to a test of homogeneity of
windowed GC%. The statistical test applied in the IHGSC's analysis, the
binomial test, is however a test of a sequence being random on the base level.
For testing the existence of isochore, or homogeneity in GC%, we propose to use
another statistical test: the analysis of variance (ANOVA). It can be shown
that DNA sequences that are rejected by binomial test may not be rejected by
the ANOVA test.

created by pumping the Sagnac interferometer with two orthogonally polarized
pulses. In this case the parametrically scattered signal-idler photons yield
biphoton interference with $>$90% visibility in coincidence detection, while no
interference is observed in direct detection of either the signal or the idler
