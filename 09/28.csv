dust-obscured star formation in distant galaxies. Although deep images from the
Multiband Imaging Photometer for SIRTF (MIPS) will provide coverage at 24, 70,
and 160 micron, the bulk of MIPS-detected objects may only have accurate
photometry in the shorter wavelength bands due to the confusion noise.
Therefore, we have explored the potential for constraining the total infrared
(IR) fluxes of distant galaxies with solely the 24 micron flux density, and for
the combination of 24 micron and 70 micron data. We also discuss the inherent
systematic uncertainties in making these transitions. Under the assumption that
distant star-forming galaxies have IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that
are represented somewhere in the local Universe, the 24 micron data (plus
optical and X-ray data to allow redshift estimation and AGN rejection)
constrains the total IR luminosity to within a factor of 2.5 for galaxies with
0.4 < z < 1.6. Incorporating the 70 micron data substantially improves this
constraint by a factor < 6. Lastly, we argue that if the shape of the IR SED is
known (or well constrained; e.g., because of high IR luminosity, or low
ultraviolet/IR flux ratio), then the IR luminosity can be estimated with more
certainty.

surrounded by a wind near to the central engine. Theoretical analysis and
numerical simulation reveal considerable stabilization of relativistic jet flow
by a wind to helical and higher order asymmetric modes of jet distortion. When
velocities are measured in the source (inlet) frame, reduction in the absolute
velocity difference between jet and wind, $\Delta v = v_{jet} - v_{wnd}$,
provides stabilization in addition to stabilization provided by a high jet
Lorentz factor, but a high Lorentz factor wind is not needed to stabilize a
high Lorentz factor jet. However, the fundamental pinch mode is not similarly
affected and knots with spacing a few times the jet radius are anticipated to
develop in such flows. Thus, we identify a mechanism that can suppress large
scale asymmetric structures while allowing axisymmetric structures to develop.
Relativistic jets surrounded by outflowing winds will be more stable than if
surrounded by a stationary or backflowing external medium. Knotty structures
along a straight jet like that in 3C 175 could be triggered by pinching of an
initially low Mach number jet surrounded by a suitable wind. As the jet enters
the radio lobe, suppression of any surrounding outflow or backflow associated
with the high pressure lobe triggers exponential growth of helical twisting.

been taken from the public archive and have been analysed in a uniform way. For
each source we present a SED plot, and for every BeppoSAX observation we give
the best fit parameters of the spectral model that best describes the data. The
energy where the maximum of the synchrotron power is emitted spans at least six
orders of magnitudes ranging from ~ 0.1 eV to over 100 keV. A wide variety of
X-ray spectral slopes have been seen depending on whether the synchrotron or
inverse Compton component, or both, are present in the X-ray band. The wide
energy bandpass of BeppoSAX allowed us to detect, and measure with good
accuracy, continuous spectral curvature in many objects whose synchrotron
radiation extends to the X-ray band. This convex curvature, which is described
by a logarithmic parabola law better than other models, may be the spectral
signature of a particle acceleration process that becomes less and less
efficient as the particles energy increases. Finally some brief considerations
about other statistical properties of the sample are presented.

cooling, the cloud breaks up into many small and dense fragments, which can
survive for a long time. We show that such rapid cooling behaviour is in fact
expected for a wide range of cloud and shock properties. This process applies
to the evolution of emission line clouds being overtaken by the cocoon of a
radio jet. The resulting small clouds would be Jeans unstable, and form stars.
Our results thus give theoretical credibility to the process of jet induced
star formation, one of the explanations for the alignment of the optical/UV and

of the half-filled cuprates are independent of the apical atom. By performing a

between features which are intrinsic and those which are a result of the

photon energy, while an asymmetry in the electron occupation probability across
the antiferromagnetic zone boundary is robust to variations in photon energy.
Finally, we show that the d-wave-like dispersion which exists in the insulator
along the antiferromagnetic zone boundary does not precisely fit the simple
d-wave functional form near the nodal direction.

confined $(d+1)$-dimensional stripped geometries ($d=1,2$) is carried out by
means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Thin films in contact with a
thermal bath are grown by adding spins with two possible orientations and
considering ferromagnetic (nearest-neighbor) interactions. At low temperatures,
it is observed that the films exhibit ``spontaneous magnetization reversals''
during the growth process. Furthermore, it is found that for $d=1$ the system
is non-critical, while a continuous order-disorder phase transition at finite
temperature takes place in the $d=2$ case. Using standard finite-size scaling
procedures, the critical temperature and some relevant critical exponents are
determined. Finally, the growth of magnetic films in $(2+1)$ dimensions with
competing short-range magnetic fields acting along the confinement walls is
studied. Due to the antisymmetric condition considered, an interface between
domains with spins having opposite orientation develops along the growing
direction. Such an interface undergoes a localization-delocalization transition
that is the precursor of a wetting transition in the thermodynamic limit.
Furthermore, the growing interface also undergoes morphological transitions in
the growth mode. A comparison between the well-studied equilibrium Ising model
and the studied irreversible magnetic growth model is performed throughout.
Although valuable analogies are encountered, it is found that the
nonequilibrium nature of the latter introduces new and rich physical features
of interest.

anti-Xi/Xi, and anti-Omega/Omega for Au+Au collisions at RHIC (sqrt{s}_{NN}=200
GeV). The effects of strong color fields associated with an enhanced
strangeness and diquark production probability and with an effective decrease
of formation times are investigated. Antibaryon-to-baryon ratios increase with
the color field strength. The ratios also increase with the strangeness content
|S|. The netbaryon number at midrapidity considerably increases with the color
field strength while the netproton number remains roughly the same. This shows
that the enhanced baryon transport involves a conversion into the hyperon
sector (hyperonization) which can be observed in the (Lambda - anti-Lambda)/(p
- anti-p) ratio.

is presented. In particular, we analyze the angular dependence of the integral
SR-intensity and peculiarities of the angular dependence of the first harmonics
SR. Studying spectral SR-intensities, we have discovered their unexpected
angular behavior, completely different from that of the integral SR-intensity.
Namely, for any given synchrotron frequency, maxima of the spectral
SR-intensities recede from the orbit plane with increasing particle energy.
Thus, in contrast with the integral SR-intensity, the spectral ones have the
tendency to deconcentrate themselves on the orbit plane.

stochastic trajectories in molecular systems with scores corresponding to their
probabilities. The procedure, which requires no initial pathway guess, is
capable of rapidly determining multiple pathways between known states.
Monotonic progress toward the target state is not required. The soft-ratcheting
algorithm is applied to an all-atom model of alanine dipeptide, whose unbiased
trajectories are assumed to follow overdamped Langevin dynamics. All possible
pathways on the two-dimensional dihedral surface are determined. The associated
probability scores, though not optimally distributed at present, may provide a
mechanism for estimating reaction rates.

quasispecies is investigated in the framework of multi-type branching
processes. Whether fixation is possible depends on the overall growth rate of
the quasispecies that will form if invasion is successful, rather than on the
individual fitness of the invading mutant. The exact fixation probability can
only be calculated if the fitnesses of all potential members of the invading
quasispecies are known. Quasispecies fixation has two important
characteristics: First, a sequence with negative selection coefficient has a
positive fixation probability as long as it has the potential to grow into a
quasispecies with an overall growth rate that exceeds the one of the
established quasispecies. Second, the fixation probabilities of sequences with
identical fitnesses can nevertheless vary over many orders of magnitudes. Two
approximations for the probability of fixation are introduced. Both
approximations require only partial knowledge about the potential members of
the invading quasispecies. The performance of these two approximations is
compared to the exact fixation probability on a network of RNA sequences with
identical secondary structure.

in photons produced through parametric down-conversion, the recent experiments
give strong evidence against measurement-induced instantaneous
spatial-localization of high-energy gamma photons. A new quantum-mechanical
analysis of the EPR problem is presented which may help to explain the observed
differences between photons produced through parametric down-conversion and
photons produced through positron/electron annihilation. The results are found
to concur with the recent experiments involving gamma photons.
