30 solar masses), and with periods of about 3 - 300d, corresponding mostly to
early Case B. These are usually thought to evolve either by reasonably
conservative Roche-lobe overflow, if the initial mass ratio is fairly mild, or
else by highly non-conservative common-envelope evolution, with spiral-in to
short periods (hours, typically), if the initial mass ratio is rather extreme.
We discuss here a handful of binaries from part of this period range (about 50
- 250d), which appear to have followed a different path: we argue that they
must have lost a large proportion of initial mass (about 70 - 80%), but without
shortening their periods at all. We suggest that their behaviour may be due to
the fact that stars of such masses, when evolved also to rather large radii,
are not far from the Humphreys-Davidson limit where single stars lose their
envelopes spontaneously in P Cygni winds, and so have envelopes which are only
lightly bound to the core. These envelopes therefore may be relatively easily
dissipated by the perturbing effect of a companion. In addition, some or all of
the stars considered here may have been close to the Cepheid instability strip
when they filled their Roche lobes. One or other, or both, of high luminosity
and Cepheid instability, in combination with an appropriately close binary
companion, may be implicated.

constrain the cosmological parameters that enter the lensing equations by means

from redshifted 21-cm line emission whose angular fluctuations reflect
clustering during before and during reionization. We have shown elsewhere that
this emission may be detectable with the planned Low Frequency Array (LOFAR)
and Square Kilometer Array (SKA) in a flat LambdaCDM. This is a direct probe of
structure during the ``Dark Ages'' at redshifts z>6 and down to smaller scales
than have previously been constrained. In our original calculation, we used a
standard approximation known as the ``linear bias'' [e.g. Mo & White (1996)].
Here we improve upon that treatment by considering the effect of nonlinear
clustering. To accomplish this, we develop a new analytical method for
calculating the nonlinear Eulerian bias of halos, which should be useful for
other applications as well. Predictions of this method are compared with the
results of LambdaCDM N-body simulations, showing significantly better agreement
than the standard linear bias approximation. When applied to the 21-cm
background from minihalos, our formalism predicts fluctuations that differ from
our original predictions by up to 30% at low frequencies and small scales.
However, within the range of frequencies and angular scales at which the signal
could be observable by LOFAR and SKA as currently planned, the differences are
small and our original predictions prove robust. Our results indicate that
while a smaller frequency bandwidth of observation leads to a higher signal
that is more sensitive to nonlinear effects, this effect is counteracted by the
lowered sensitivity of the radio arrays. We calculate the best frequency
bandwidth for these observations to be Delta nu~2 MHz.(abbreviated)

worthwhile to analyze associative memory models with delayed synapses. Thus, a

employed. Its dynamic properties are analyzed by the statistical neurodynamics.
In this paper, we first re-derive the Yanai-Kim theory, which involves
macrodynamical equations for the dynamics of the network with serial delay
elements. Since their theory needs a computational complexity of $O(L^4t)$ to
obtain the macroscopic state at time step t where L is the length of delay, it
is intractable to discuss the macroscopic properties for a large L limit. Thus,
we derive steady state equations using the discrete Fourier transformation,

found a one to one holographic mapping between bulk and boundary scalar fields.
Associating the bulk fields with dilatons and the boundary fields with
glueballs of the confining gauge theory we also found the same high energy QCD
scaling. Here, using this holographic mapping we give a simple estimate for the
mass ratios of the glueballs assuming the AdS slice approximation to be valid

example, when the Grassmann structure is associated with a quaternionic Kaehler
structure on M, half-flatness implies the Yang-Mills equations. Inspired by the
harmonic space approach, we develop a local construction of (holomorphic)
half-flat connections \nabla^W over a complex manifold with (holomorphic)
Grassmann structure equipped with a suitable linear connection. Any such
connection \nabla^W can be obtained from a prepotential by solving a system of
linear first order ODEs. The construction can be applied, for instance, to the
complexification of hyper-Kaehler manifolds or more generally to hyper-Kaehler
manifolds with admissible torsion and to their higher-spin analogues. It yields
solutions of the Yang-Mills equations.

The DP equation: $m_t+um_x+3mu_x=0, m=u-u_{xx}$, proposed recently by

hierarchy while the first one in the positive hierarchy is:\
$m_t=4(m^{-{2/3}})_x-5(m^{-{2/3}})_{xxx}+ (m^{-{2/3}})_{xxxxx}$. The whole
hierarchy is shown Lax-integrable through solving a key matrix equation. To
obtain the parametric solutions for the whole hierarchy, we separatedly discuss
the negative and the positive hierarchies. For the negative hierarchy, its
$3\times3$ Lax pairs and corresponding adjoint representations are
nonlinearized to be Liouville-integrable Hamiltonian canonical systems under
the so-called Dirac-Poisson bracket defined on a symplectic submanifold of
$\R^{6N} $. Based on the integrability of those finite-dimensional canonical
Hamiltonian systems we give the parametric solutions of the all equations in
the negative hierarchy. In particular, we obtain the parametric solution of the
DP equation. Moreover, for the positive hierarchy, we consider the different
constraint and use a similar procudure to the negative case to obtain the
parametric solutions of the positive hierarchy. In particular, we give the
parametric solution of the 5th-order PDE
$m_t=4(m^{-{2/3}})_x-5(m^{-{2/3}})_{xxx}+ (m^{-{2/3}})_{xxxxx}$. Finally, we
discuss the stationary solutions of the 5th-order PDE, and particularly give

When the perturbation increases the momentum of the embedded soliton, the
perturbed state approaches asymptotically the embedded soliton, while when the

class of ordinary differential equations is presented. Consequently, the real
number set gets replaced by an extended physical set, each element of which is
endowed with an equivalence class of infinitesimally separated neighbours in
the form of random fluctuations. We show how a sense of time and evolution is
intrinsically defined by the infinite continued fraction of the golden mean
irrational number ${\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}}$, which plays a key role in this
extended SL(2,R) formalism of Calculus. Time may thereby undergo random
inversions generating well defined random scales, thus allowing a dynamical
system to evolve self similarly over the set of multiple scales. The late time
stochastic fluctuations of a dynamical system enjoys the generic $1/f$
spectrum. A universal form of the related probability density is also derived.
We prove that the golden mean number is intrinsically random, letting all
measurements in the physical universe fundamentally uncertain. The present
analysis offers an explanation of the universal occurrence of the golden mean
in diverse natural and biological processes.

corrugation is not small compared to the period. For such a structure we
generate analytical approximate solutions for the wave number $k$, group
velocity $v_g$, and loss factor $\kappa$ for the lowest (the dominant) mode
which, when compared with the results of the complete numerical solution,
agreed well. We find: if $w\sim a$, where $w$ is the beam pipe width and $a$ is
the beam pipe half-height, then one mode dominates the impedance, with
$k\sim1/\sqrt{w\delta}$ ($\delta$ is the depth of corrugation),

contribute to the impedance, resulting in a wakefield that Landau damps.
