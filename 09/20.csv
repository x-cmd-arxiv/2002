applied to construct a realistic model of the planetary nebula NGC 3918. Three
different geometric models were tried.
  The effects of the interaction of the diffuse fields coming from two adjacent
regions of different densities were investigated. These are found to be
non-negligible, even for the relatively uncomplicated case of a biconical
geometry. We found that the ionization structure of low ionization species near
the boundaries is particularly affected.
  It is found that all three models provided acceptable matches to the
integrated nebular optical and ultraviolet spectrum. Large discrepancies were
found between all of the model predictions of infrared fine-structure line
fluxes and ISO SWS measurements. This was found to be largely due to an offset
of ~14 arcsec from the centre of the nebula that affected all of the ISO
observations of NGC 3918.
  For each model, we also produced projected emission-line maps and
position-velocity diagrams from synthetic long-slit spectra, which could be
compared to recent HST images and ground-based long-slit echelle spectra. This
comparison showed that spindle-like model B provided the best match to the
observations. We have therefore shown that although the integrated emission
line spectrum of NGC 3918 can be reproduced by all three of the

projected emission-line maps and position-velocity diagrams from synthetic
long-slit spectra was crucial in allowing us to constrain the structure of this

to the image of a star or quasi-stellar object to determine its centroid with
an accuracy of about 0.005 pixel (0.25 milliarcseconds) -- an accuracy
sufficient to measure the proper motion of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy using
images separated by just a few years. The data consist of images, dithered to
reduce the effects of undersampling, taken at multiple epochs with the Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph or the Wide Field Planetary Camera. The science
fields are in the directions of the Carina, Fornax, Sculptor, and Ursa Minor
dwarf spheroidal galaxies and each has at least one quasi-stellar object whose
identity has been established by other studies. The rate of change with time of
the centroids of the stars of the dwarf spheroidal with respect to the centroid
of the quasi-stellar object is the proper motion.
  Four independent preliminary measurements of the proper motion of Fornax for
three fields agree within their uncertainties. The weighted average of these
measurements is mu_alpha = 49 +- 13 milliarcseconds/century and mu_delta = -59
+- 13 milliarcseconds/century. The Galactocentric velocity derived from the
proper motion implies that Fornax is near perigalacticon, may not be bound to
the Milky Way, and is not a member of any of the proposed streams of galaxies
and globular clusters in the Galactic halo. If Fornax is bound, the Milky Way
must have a mass of at least (1.6 +- 0.8) x 10^{12} solar masses.

Zincblende Ga$_{1-x}$Cr$_{x}$As was grown by low-temperature molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE). At low concentrations, x$\sim$0.1, the materials exhibit unusual
magnetic properties associated with the random magnetism of the alloy. At low
temperatures the magnetization M(B) increases rapidly with increasing field due
to the alignment of ferromagnetic units (polarons or clusters) having large
dipole moments of order 10-10$^2$$\mu_B$. A standard model of
superparamagnetism is inadequate for describing both the field and temperature
dependence of the magnetization M(B,T). In order to explain M(B) at low
temperatures we employ a distributed magnetic moment (DMM) model in which
polarons or clusters of ions have a distribution of moments. It is also found
that the magnetic susceptibility increases for decreasing temperature but
saturates below T=4 K. The inverse susceptibility follows a linear-T
Curie-Weiss law and extrapolates to a magnetic transition temperature
$\theta$=10 K. In magnetotransport measurements, a room temperature resistivity
of $\rho$=0.1 $\Omega$cm and a hole concentration of $\sim10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$
are found, indicating that Cr can also act as a acceptor similar to Mn. The
resistivity increases rapidly for decreasing temperature below room
temperature, and becomes strongly insulating at low temperatures. The
conductivity follows exp[-(T$_1$/T)$^{1/2}$] over a large range of

neutrinos can interact with photon, mediated by the corresponding charged
leptons (real or virtual). The effect of a medium or an electromagnetic field
is two-fold - to induce an effective $\nu \gamma$ vertex and to modify the
dispersion relations of all the particles involved to render the processes
kinematically viable. It has already been noted that in a medium neutrinos
acquire an effective charge, which in the standard model of electroweak
interaction comes from the vector type vertex of weak interaction. On the other
hand in a magnetized plasma, the axial vector part also start contributing to
the effective charge of a neutrino. This contribution corresponding to the
axial vector part in the interaction Lagrangian is denoted as the axial
polarisation tensor. In an earlier paper we explicitly calculated the form of
the axial polarisation tensor to all odd orders in external magnetic field. In
this note we complete that investigation by computing the same, to all even
orders in external magnetic field. We further show its gauge invarience
properties. Finally we infer upon the zero external momentum limit of this

0$, the model reduces to the two-brane model of Randall-Sundrum, whereas larger
values of $\alpha$ allow for a less warped bulk geometry. Using the moduli
space approximation, we derive the four-dimensional low-energy effective action
from a supergravity-inspired five-dimensional theory. For arbitrary values of
$\alpha$, the resulting theory has the form of a bi-scalar-tensor theory. We
show that, in order to be consistent with local gravitational observations,
$\alpha$ has to be small (less than $10^{-2}$) and the separation of the branes
must be large. We study the cosmological evolution of the interbrane distance
and the bulk scalar field for different matter contents on each branes. Our
findings indicate that attractor solutions exist which drive the moduli fields
towards values consistent with observations. The efficiency of the attractor
mechanism crucially depends on the matter content on each branes. In the
five-dimensional description, the attractors correspond to the motion of the
negative tension brane towards a bulk singularity, which signals the eventual
breakdown of the four-dimensional description and the necessity of a better
understanding of the bulk singularity.

formalism to analyze open strings in gauge trivial closed string backgrounds,

formalism, where the results have the most natural interpretation. The most
remarkable finding is that, in the presence of a Dp-brane, both a constant
parallel NS-NS B-field and R-R C^(p-1)-field do not solve the open/closed
equations of motion, and induce the same non-vanishing open string tadpole.
After solving the open string equations in the presence of this tadpole, and
after gauging away the closed string fields, one is left with a U(1) field
strength on the brane given by F=(1/2)(B-*C^(p-1)), where * is Hodge duality
along the brane world-volume. One observes that this result differs from the
usually assumed result F=B. Technically, this is due to the fact that
supersymmetric and bosonic string world-sheet theories are different. Note,
however, that the usual F+B combination is still the combination which remains
gauge invariant at the sigma-model level. Also, the standard result F=B is, in
the D3-brane case, not compatible with S-duality. On the other hand our result,
which is derived automatically given the general formalism, offers a
non-trivial check of S-duality, to all orders in F, and this leads to a S-dual
invariant Moyal deformation. In an appendix, we solve the source equation
describing the open superstring in a generic NS-NS and R-R closed string
background, within the super Poincare covariant formalism.

progress on our way to understand the symmetry structure of toroidally
(compactified and) reduced M-theory. The first indication of a (possibly) thin
spot in the wall that prevents us from deriving a priori the U-duality
symmetries of these models is to be found in the analysis of the hyperbolic
billiards that control the chaotic time evolution of (quasi)homogeneous
anisotropic String, Supergravity or Einstein cosmologies near a spacelike
singularity. What happens is that U-duality symmetry controls chaos via
negative constant curvature. On the other hand it was noticed in 1982 that
(symmetrizable) ''hyperbolic'' Kac-Moody algebras have maximal rank ten,
exactly like superstring models and that two of these four rank ten algebras
matched physical theories. My second reason for optimism actually predates also
the previous breakthrough, it was the discovery in 1998 of surprising
superalgebras extending U-dualities to all (p+1)-forms (associated to
p-branes). They have a super-nonlinear sigma model structure similar to the
symmetric space structure associated to 0-forms and they obey a universal
self-duality field equation. As the set of forms is doubled to implement
electric-magnetic duality, they obey a set of first order equations. More
remains to be discovered but the beauty and subtlety of the structure cannot be
a random emergence from chaos. In fact we shall explain how a third maximal
rank hyperbolic algebra $BE_{10}$ controls heterotic cosmological chaos and how
as predicted Einstein's General Relativity fits into the general picture.

elliptic curve $E:Y^2=X^3-X.$ In this work we generalise du Sautoy\rq s
construction to define a class of groups whose local zeta functions are
dependent upon the number of points on the reduction of a given elliptic curve
with a rational point. We also construct a class of groups that behave the same
way in relation to any curve of genus 2 with a rational point. We end with a
discussion of problems arising from this work.

extended to a non-locality implying terms that involve an anticommutator with
the operator p^2. It includes both scalar and tensor components. The most
recent ``high accuracy'' models are considered in the analysis. After studying
the deuteron wave functions, electromagnetic properties of various models are
compared with the idea that these ones differ by their non-locality but are
equivalent up to a unitary transformation. It is found that the extra non-local
tensor interaction considered in this work tends to re-enforce the role of the
term considered in previous works, allowing one to explain almost completely
the difference in the deuteron D-state probabilities evidenced by the
comparison of the Bonn-QB and Paris models for instance. Conclusions for the
effect of the non-local scalar interaction are not so clear. In many cases, it
was found that these terms could explain part of the differences that the
comparison of predictions for various models evidences but cases where they
could not were also found. Some of these last ones have been analyzed in order
to pointing out the origin of the failure.

The transition from a BCS-like to the normal (unpaired) state, as the isospin
asymmetry is increased, is intervened by superconducting phases which
spontaneously break translational and rotational symmetries. One possibility is
the formation of a condensate with a periodic crystallinelike structure where
Cooper pairs carry net momentum (the nuclear
Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell-phase). Alternatively, perturbations of the
Fermi surfaces away from spherical symmetry allow for minima in the condensate
free energy which correspond to a states with quadrupole deformations of Fermi
surfaces and zero momentum of the Cooper pairs. In a combined treatment of
these phases we show that, although the Cooper pairing with finite momentum
might arise as a local minimum, the lowest energy state features are deformed
Fermi surfaces and Cooper pairs with vanishing total momentum.

soil bacteria. Each bacterium is understood as a carrier of a phenotypic
parameter p. The central aim is the calculation of the probability density with
respect to p of the carriers living at time t>0. The theory involves two small
parameters: the mutation probability $\mu$ and a parameter $\gamma$ involved in
a function w(p) defining the fitness of the bacteria to survive the generation
time $\tau$ and give birth to offspring. The mutation from a state p to a state
q is defined by a Gaussian. The author focuses attention on an equation
generalizing Waxman's equation. The author solves this equation in the standard
style of a perturbation theory and discusses how the solution depends on the
choice of the fitness function w(p). In a sense, the function
$c(p)=1-w(p)/w(0)$ is analogous to the dispersion function E(p) of fictitious
quasiparticles. With a general function c(p), the distribution function
${\mathit\Phi}(p,t;0)$ is composed of a delta-function component,
$N(t)\delta(p)$, and a blurred component. The author shows that asymptotically
N(t) may tend to a positive value, in contrast with zero resulting from
Waxman's approximation where $c(p)\sim p^2$.

this process requires knowledge of the radiative lifetime of the excited
singlet A$^1\Sigma^+$ state of the (NaCa)$^+$ molecular system. We calculate
the rate coefficient for radiative charge transfer using a semiclassical
approach. The dipole radial matrix elements between the ground and the excited
states, and the potential curves were calculated using Complete Active Space
Self-Consistent field and M\""oller-Plesset second order perturbation theory
(CASSCF/MP2) with an extended Gaussian basis, 6-311+G(3df). The semiclassical
charge transfer rate coefficient was averaged over a thermal Maxwellian
distribution. In addition we also present elastic collision cross sections and
the spin-exchange cross section. The rate coefficient for charge transfer was
found to be $2.3\times 10^{-16}$ cm$^3$/sec, while those for the elastic and
spin-exchange cross sections were found to be several orders of magnitude
higher ($1.1\times 10^{-8}$ cm$^3$/sec and $2.3\times 10^{-9}$ cm$^3$/sec,
respectively). This confirms our assumption that the milli-Kelvin regime of
collisional cooling of calcium ions by sodium atoms is favorable with the
respect to low loss of calcium ions due to the charge transfer.
