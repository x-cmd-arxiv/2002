poorly sampled in frequency and spatially unresolved. Their form is crucially
important for estimating the large luminosities of these galaxies accurately,
for providing circumstantial evidence concerning their power sources, and for
estimating their redshifts in the absence of spectroscopic information. We
discuss the suite of parameters necessary to describe their SEDs adequately
without introducing unnecessary complexity. We compare directly four popular
descriptions, explain the key degeneracies between the parameters in each when
confronted with data, and highlight the differences in their best-fitting
values. Using one representative SED model, we show that fitting to even a
large number of radio, submillimetre and far-infrared (far-IR) continuum
colours provides almost no power to discriminate between the redshift and dust
temperature of an observed galaxy, unless an accurate relationship with a tight
scatter exists between luminosity and temperature for the whole galaxy
population. We review our knowledge of this luminosity-dust temperature
relation derived from three galaxy samples, to better understand the size of
these uncertainties. Contrary to recent claims, we stress that far-IR-based
photometric redshifts are unlikely to be sufficiently accurate to impose useful
constraints on models of galaxy evolution: finding spectroscopic redshifts for
distant dusty galaxies will remain essential.

of TeV photons due to pair-production on the optical and near infrared

regions of a 2DEG, forming confined regions of specific geometry called
billiards, in which ballistic transport occurs. At millikelvin temperatures,
the electron phase coherence length is sufficient that quantum interference
effects produce reproducible magneto-conductance fluctuations (MCF) that act as
a 'magneto-fingerprint' of the scattering dynamics in the billiard. It has been
predicted that billiard MCF are fractal. Fractal MCF in mesoscopic
semiconductor billiards are investigated experimentally. The MCF of a Sinai
billiard displayed exact self-similarity (ESS). A correlation function analysis
is used to quantify the presence of ESS. A model for the Sinai billiard MCF
based on a Weierstrass function is presented. Using a bridging interconnect, a
continuous transition between the Sinai and an empty square geometry is
achieved. The removal of the circle induces a transition from ESS to
statistical self-similarity (SSS), suggesting that ESS is due to the presence
of an obstacle at the center of the billiard. The physical dependencies of SSS
are investigated and show variation in the fractal dimension, rather than the
fractal scaling range. SSS obeys a unified picture where the fractal dimension
depends only on the ratio between the average spacing and broadening of
billiard energy levels, irrespective of other billiard parameters. The
semiclassical origin of SSS is demonstrated and the suppression of SSS is
observed in both the quantum and classical limits. The influence of soft-wall
potential profile on fractal MCF is investigated using double-2DEG billiards.
Detailed reviews of semiconductor billiard fabrication, low-temperature
electrical measurements and fractal analysis are also presented.

consequence of the convergence of the perturbation expansions is the existence
of a discontinuity in the particle number density at the Fermi surface. Here,
we present a self contained formulation of our main results and give an

We are particularly interested in homogeneous ideals in an N-graded ring
generated by all homogeneous elements of degree at least m and monomial ideals
in a polynomial ring over a field. For ideals of the first trype we generalize
a recent result of S. Faridi. We prove that a monomial ideal in a polynomial
ring in n indeterminates over a field is normal if and only if the first n-1
positive powers of the ideal are integrally closed. We then specialize to the
case of ideals obtained by taking integral closures of m-primary ideals
generated by powers of the variables. We obtain classes of normal monomial
ideals and arithmetic critera for deciding when the monomial ideal is not
normal.

a recently proposed method for studying the complexity of nonlinear random
dynamical systems. The new measure of complexity is defined in terms of the
average number of bits per time-unit necessary to specify the sequence
generated by the system. This measure coincides with the rate of divergence of
nearby trajectories under two different realizations of the noise. In
particular, we show that the complexity of a nonlinear time-series model
constructed from sheep populations comes completely from the environmental
variations. However, in other situations, intrinsic chaos can be the crucial
factor. This method can be applied to many other systems in biology and
physics.

second line corresponds to the minimum mass function for black hole candidates

difficulties due to the mathematical structure of Hilbert space, as reflected
in Birkhoff and von Neumann's proposal for a quantum logic. The (consistent or
decoherent) histories solution is provided by its single framework rule, an
approach that includes conventional (Copenhagen) quantum theory as a special
case. Mermin's Ithaca interpretation addresses the same problem by defining
probabilities which make no reference to a sample space or event algebra
(``correlations without correlata''). But this leads to severe conceptual
difficulties, which almost inevitably couple quantum theory to unresolved
problems of human consciousness. Using histories allows a sharper quantum
description than is possible with a density matrix, suggesting that the latter
provides an ensemble rather than an irreducible single-system description as
claimed by Mermin. The histories approach satisfies the first five of Mermin's
desiderata for a good interpretation of quantum mechanics, including Einstein
locality, but the Ithaca interpretation seems to have difficulty with the first
(independence of observers) and the third (describing individual systems).
