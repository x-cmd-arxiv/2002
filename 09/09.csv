flares is presented. Low-frequency electromagnetic plasma waves excited by the
Electron Firehose Instability (EFI) can account for the acceleration of ions up
to 1 MeV/amu energies as a single stage process. The EFI arises as a direct
consequence of the free energy stored in a temperature anisotropy
(T_parallel>T_perp) of the bulk energized electron population during the
acceleration process. In contrast to other mechanisms which require special
plasma properties, the EFI is an intrinsic feature of the acceleration process
of the bulk electrons. Being present as a side effect in the flaring plasma,
these waves can account for the acceleration of 3He and 4He while selectively
enhancing 3He due to the spectral energy density built up from linear growth.
Linearized kinetic theory, analytic models and test-particle simulations have
been applied to investigate the ability of the waves to accelerate and
fractionate. As waves grow in both directions parallel to the magnetic field,
they can trap resonant ions and efficiently accelerate them to the highest
energies. Plausible models have been found that can explain the observed
energies, spectra and abundances of 3He and 4He.

propose that neutrino-proton elastic scattering, $\nu + p \to \nu + p$, can be
used for the detection of supernova neutrinos in scintillator detectors. It
should be emphasized immediately that the dominant signal is on {\it free}
protons. Though the proton recoil kinetic energy spectrum is soft, with $T_p
\simeq 2 E_\nu^2/M_p$, and the scintillation light output from slow, heavily
ionizing protons is quenched, the yield above a realistic threshold is nearly
as large as that from $\bar{\nu}_e + p \to e^+ + n$. In addition, the measured
proton spectrum is related to the incident neutrino spectrum. The ability to
detect this signal would give detectors like KamLAND and Borexino a crucial and

times produce prominent filamentary spiral structures in the disc, and lead to
stellar motions that are potentially observable with future high precision

area, with 50"" resolution, in the low-J transitions of CO, 13CO, C18O, N2H+,
CH3OH, and SiO.
  Using these combined data sets, with consistent assumptions, we find
beam-averaged o-H2O abundances of > 10^{-6} relative to H2O for all four
outflows. A comparison of SWAS and ISO water data is consistent with
non-dissociative shock models, provided the majority of the 557 GHz emission
arises from cool post-shock material with enhanced abundances. In the ambient
gas the o-H2O abundance is found to lie between 0.1-1 x 10^{-7} relative to H2
and is enhanced when compared to cold pre-stellar molecular cores. A comparison
of the water emission with tracers of dense condensations and shock chemistry
finds no clear correlation. However, the water emission appears to be
associated with the presence of luminous external heating sources which power
the reflection nebula and the photodissociation (PDR) region. Simple PDR models
are capable of reproducing the water and high-J 13CO emission, suggesting that
a PDR may account for the excitation of water in low density undepleted gas as
suggested by Spaans & van Dishoeck (2001).

observed with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) during a 1000 day period
between May 1996 and March 1999. The spectra were obtained as part of
monitoring observations and from two long observations using the RXTE
Proportional Counter Array (PCA). During the monitoring period the 2-10 keV
flux of NGC 4051 varied between 10E-12 and 7x 10E11 (cgs). We re-analysed RXTE
PCA observations from a distinct low state in May 1998 using the latest
background and detector response models. The RXTE and BeppoSAX observations of
NGC 4051 during the low state show a very hard spectrum with a strong
unresolved fluorescence line. This emission, probably due to reflection from a
molecular torus, is likely to be constant over long time-scales and is
therefore assumed as an underlying component at all flux states. By subtracting
the torus component we are able to determine the spectral variability of the
primary continuum. In the variable component we observe a strong
anti-correlation of X-ray flux and spectral hardness in the PCA energy band. We
show that the changes in hardness are caused by slope variability of the
primary power law spectrum rather than by changing reflection or variable
photoelectric absorption. The primary spectral index varies between Gamma=1.6
for the faintest states and Gamma=2.3 during the brightest states, at which
level the spectral index approaches an asympotic value. We find that the
response of the flux of the 6.4 keV iron fluorescence line to changes in the
continuum flux depends on the timescale of the observation. The profile of the
line is very broad and indicates an origin in the innermost regions of the
accretion disk.

0200+015 (z=2.23) and 0943-242 (z=2.92). The absorbers in 0943-242 exhibit
little additional structure compared with previous low-resolution spectroscopy
and the main absorber is still consistent with HI column density of ~10^19
cm^-2. This is consistent with a picture in which the absorbing gas has low
density and low metallicity and is distributed in a smooth absorbing shell
located beyond the emission-line gas. However, the main absorbers in 0200+015
are very different. The previous single absorber fit of HI column density
\~10^19 cm^-2, now splits into two ~4 x 10^14 cm^-2 absorbers which extend more
than 15kpc to obscure additional Ly-alpha emission coincident with a radio lobe
in these high-resolution observations. Although consistent with the shell-like
distribution for the absorption systems, 0200+015 requires a much higher metal
enrichment than 0943-242. The metallicity, inferred from the CIV absorption, is
considerably lower in 0943-242 than in 0200+015. We explain these differences
with an evolutionary scenario based on the size of the radio source. In both
sources the HI absorption gas originates from either a gas-rich merger or
pristine cluster gas which cools and collapses towards the centre of the dark
matter halo. The higher metallicity in the larger radio source (0200+015) may
be a result of a starburst driven superwind (concurrent with the triggering of
the radio emission) which has engulfed the outer halo in this older source.

description of the transition is invalid in spatial dimensions $d\leq 3$ due to
the existence of soft particle-hole excitations that couple to the order
parameter fluctuations and lead to an upper critical dimension $d_c^+ = 3$. A
generalized mean-field theory that takes these additional modes into account
predicts a fluctuation-induced first-order transition. In a certain parameter
regime, this first-order transition in turn is unstable with respect to a
fluctuation-induced second-order transition. The quantum ferromagnetic
transition may thus be either of first or of second-order, in agreement with
experimental observations. A detailed discussion is given of the stability of
the first-order transition, and of the critical behavior at the
fluctuation-induced second-order transition. In $d=3$, the latter is mean
field-like with logarithmic corrections to scaling, and in $d<3$ it can be
controlled by means of a $3-\epsilon$ expansion.

scattering on the dotty-impurities system. The drag current spectral dependence
is characterized by Zeeman doublet with a pronounced beak-type peak. This peak

  cond-mat/0209211",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.67.021303",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  A two-dimensional lattice model for the formation and evolution of shear
bands in granular media is proposed. Each lattice site is assigned a random
variable which reflects the local density. At every time step, the strain is
localized along a single shear-band which is a spanning path on the lattice
chosen through an extremum condition. The dynamics consists of randomly
changing the `density' of the sites only along the shear band, and then
repeating the procedure of locating the extremal path and changing it. Starting
from an initially uncorrelated density field, it is found that this dynamics
leads to a slow compaction along with a non-trivial patterning of the system,
with high density regions forming which shelter long-lived low-density valleys.
Further, as a result of these large density fluctuations, the shear band which
was initially equally likely to be found anywhere on the lattice, gets
progressively trapped for longer and longer periods of time. This state is
however meta-stable, and the system continues to evolve slowly in a manner
reminiscent of glassy dynamics. Several quantities have been studied
numerically which support this picture and elucidate the unusual system-size
effects at play.

the proof that, for any fixed renormalization prescription, the interacting

  Concept Based on the Statistical Properties of Synchrotron Radiation","54 pages, 20 figures",,"10.1016/S0030-4018(03)01502-5","DESY 02-127, September, 2002","physics.ins-det physics.optics",,"  The paper describes a new concept of visible pump/X-ray probe/slow detector
experiments that could be performed at third-generation synchrotron light
sources. We propose a technique that would allow time resolution up to
femtosecond capabilities to be recovered from a long (100 ps) X-ray probe
pulse. The visible pump pulse must be as short as the desired time resolution.
The principle of operation of the proposed pump-probe scheme is essentially
based on the statistical properties of the synchrotron radiation. These
properties are well known in statistical optics as properties of completely
chaotic polarized light. Our technique utilizes the fact that, for any
synchrotron light beam there exist some characteristic time (coherence time),
which determines the time-scale of the random fluctuations. The typical
coherence time of soft X-ray synchrotron light at the exit of monochromator is
in the femtosecond range. An excited state is prepared with a pump pulse and
then projected with a probe pulse onto a final ion state. The first statistical
quantity of interest is the variance of the number of photoelectrons detected
during synchrotron radiation pulse. The statistics of concern are defined over
an ensemble of synchrotron radiation pulses. From a set of variances measured
as a function of coherence time (inversely proportional to monochromator
bandwidth) it is possible to reconstruct the femtosecond dynamical process.

that the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm is not far from optimal. The moral is
that the need to ""uncompute"" garbage can impose a fundamental limit on
efficient quantum computation. The proof introduces a new parameter of Boolean
functions called the ""nonparity coefficient,"" which might be of independent

proposed. The class is based on the use of sets of unitary quantum operations

quantum message used in transmission. The previous secret between partners
required for any authentication is a classical key. We obtain the minimal
requirements on the unitary operations that lead to a probability of failure of
the scheme less than one. This failure may be caused by someone performing a
unitary operation on the message in the channel between the communicating
partners, or by a potential forger impersonating the transmitter.

this context pure, maximally entangled states have received considerable
attention. In the case of bipartite qubit-systems the four orthonormal
Bell-states are of this type. One of these Bell states, the singlet Bell-state,
has the additional property of being antisymmetric with respect to particle
exchange. In this contribution we discuss possible generalizations of this
antisymmetric Bell-state to cases with more than two particles and with
single-particle Hilbert spaces involving more than two dimensions. We review
basic properties of these totally antisymmetric states. Among possible
applications of this class of states we analyze a new quantum key sharing
protocol and methods for comparing quantum states.
