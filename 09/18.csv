substantial star formation; the aggregate effects of these interactions on the
evolutionary histories of galaxies in the Universe are poorly understood. We
combine B and R-band photometry and optical spectroscopy to estimate the
strengths and timescales of bursts of triggered star formation in the centers
of 190 galaxies in pairs and compact groups. Based on an analysis of the
measured colors and EW(H-alpha), we characterize the pre-existing and triggered
populations separately. The best-fitting burst scenarios assume stronger
reddening corrections for line emission than for the continuum and continuous
star formation lasting for \gtrsim a hundred Myr. The most realistic scenarios
require an initial mass function that is deficient in the highest-mass stars.
The color of the pre-existing stellar population is the most significant source
of uncertainty. Triggered star formation contributes substantially (probably >=
50%) to the R-band flux in the central regions of several galaxies; tidal tails
do not necessarily accompany this star formation. Many of the galaxies in our
sample have bluer centers than outskirts, suggesting that pre- or non-merger
interactions may lead to evolution along the Hubble sequence. These objects
would appear blue and compact at higher redshifts; the older, redder outskirts
of the disks would be difficult to detect. Our data indicate that galaxies with
larger separations on the sky contain weaker, and probably older, bursts of
star formation on average. However, confirmation of these trends requires
further constraints on the colors of the older stellar populations and on the
reddening for individual galaxies.

simple stellar population models (SSPs) with Salpeter initial mass functions
(IMFs) and with metallicities and ages derived from optical Lick (Fe, Mg and
Hbeta) indices. Uncertainties in the calibration, the fitting functions and the
SSP modeling taken separately cannot explain the discrepancy. On the average,
the observed PaT values are within the range allowed by the models and the
large uncertainties in the fitting functions. b) The steepening of the IMF at
low masses required to lower the CaT* and CaT indices to the observed values is
incompatible with the measured FeH index at 9916 AA and the dynamical
mass-to-light ratios of ellipticals. c) Composite stellar populations with a
low-metallicity component reduce the disagreement, but rather artificial
metallicity distributions are needed. Another explanation may be that calcium

determine the absorbing column density towards its X-ray source and measure its
X-ray spectrum. The ultimate goal was to constrain the properties of the medium
responsible for the metastable Fe II absorption lines observed in its UV
spectrum. The 0.5-10 keV X-ray spectrum is described by a simple power-law
model of photon index 1.58+/-0.04 modified by photoelectric absorption with an
column density of (2.8+/-0.3)x10^{21} cm^{-2}. An Fe K-alpha line is not
detected with an upper limit to its equivalent width of 200 eV (assuming FWHM =
60,000 km/s. Using the above column density the observed S.E.D. as constraints,
we explore simple photoionization models for the absorber for a wide range of
densities and ionization parameters in an effort to reproduce the strengths of
the UV absorption lines. We find that densities of at least 1x10^{11} cm^{-3}
are needed. However, a single ionization parameter cannot explain all of the
observed lines. An ionization parameter between 10^{-2.5} and 10^{-3.5} is
needed for the Mg and Fe lines and the soft X-ray absorption, but lines from
Si, C, Al, and H require different density-ionization parameter combinations.
According to the models, such an absorbing medium must be located very close to
the source of ionizing radiation (within 5,000 gravitational radii) and must be
very compact. As such, the properties of this absorbing medium differ from
those of more luminous quasars, but are reminiscent of the absorber in the
Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. We suggest that the absorber is in the form of thin
sheets or filaments embedded in a wind wind that overlays the accretion disk of
Arp 102B. This picture is consistent with all of the available constraints on
the central engine of this object.

find that the spectrum of the pulsar is significantly harder than that of the

delineated by the radio shell with a surface brightness distribution strikingly
similar to the radio emission. The presence of strong lines attributable to
ionized Mg, Si, and S indicate that at least some of this emission is thermal

underionized plasma with non-solar elemental abundances, we find we require an

then apply realistic criteria for lens resolution, and the result is presented
as a function of the time elapsed after an original lensing measurement,

approximately three times larger X-ray remnant. Our Chandra data reveal a
number of new physical structures in N63A. The most striking of these are the
several ``crescent''-shaped structures located beyond the main shell that
resemble similar features seen in the Vela SNR. In Vela, these have been
interpreted as arising from high speed clumps of supernova ejecta interacting
with the ambient medium. Another distinct feature of the remnant is a roughly
triangular ``hole'' in the X-ray emission near the location of the optical
lobes and the brightest radio emission. X-ray spectral analysis shows that this
deficit of emission is a result of absorption by an intervening dense cloud
with a mass of ~450 M_sun that is currently being engulfed by the remnant's
blast wave. We also find that the rim of the remnant, as well as the
crescent-shaped features, have considerably softer X-ray spectra than the
interior. Limits on hard X-ray emission rule out a young, energetic pulsar in

identifies those bodies that fall in the beams of Planck and their signal
stenght. According to our simulations, a total of 397 objects will be observed

total sky scan--circles. A significant fraction (in the range from ~50 to 100
objects) of the 397 asteroids will be observed with a high S/N ratio. Flux
measurements of a large sample of asteroids in the submillimeter and millimeter

modes. The small thermal velocity fluctuations suggest that the system can be

gaps (inverse correlation lengths) and scaled domain-wall free energies, we
provide strong evidence that a critical (Kosterlitz-Thouless) phase is present,
whose upper limit is, in our best estimate, $T_c=0.29 \pm 0.01$. From analysis
of the (extremely anisotropic) nature of excitations below $T_c$, we argue that
the critical phase extends all the way down to T=0. While domain walls parallel
to the ferromagnetic direction are soft for the whole extent of the critical
phase, those along the antiferromagnetic direction seem to undergo a softening
transition at a finite temperature. Assuming a bulk correlation length varying,
for $T>T_c$, as $\xi (T) =a_\xi \exp [ b_\xi (T-T_c)^{-\sigma}]$, $\sigma
\simeq 1/2$, we attempt finite-size scaling plots of our finite-width
correlation lengths. Our best results are for $T_c=0.50 \pm 0.01$. We propose a
scenario in which such inconsistency is attributed to the extreme narrowness of

the transition than in pure PZN (> 40 K), due to stronger correlations between
the polar regions. Neutron inelastic scattering measurements have also been
performed on PZN-xPT. The results show the broadening of the transverse

attribute this broadening to the appearance of the polar nanoregions.

groups of synchronized oscillators (clusters) are formed that send pulses
alternately, resulting in a periodic dynamics of the network. Under the
influence of arbitrarily weak noise, this synchronization is followed by a
desynchronization of clusters, a phenomenon induced by attractors that are
unstable. Perpetual synchronization and desynchronization lead to a switching
among attractors. This is explained by the geometrical fact, that these
unstable attractors are surrounded by basins of attraction of other attractors,
whereas the full measure of their own basin is located remote from the
attractor. Unstable attractors do not only exist in these systems, but moreover
dominate the dynamics for large networks and a wide range of parameters.

conductance fluctuations of completely chaotic billiards. In order to elucidate
the origin of the isolated resonances, we calculate the associated scattering
states as well as the eigenstates of the corresponding closed system. As a
result, we find a one-to-one correspondence between the resonant scattering
states and eigenstates of the closed system. The broad distribution of
resonance widths is traced to the structure of the classical phase space.
Husimi representations of the resonant scattering states show a strong overlap

transition temperatures in the range 100-260 K, compounds with 0.2 < x < 0.5
are ferromagnetic and metallic whereas those with 0.5 < x < 0.9 are
antiferromagnetic and charge ordered. In a narrow region around x = 0.5, these
totally dissimilar states are thought to coexist. Uehara et al. have shown that
charge order and charge disorder can coexist in the related compound
La0.25Pr0.375Ca0.375MnO3. Here, we present electron microscopy data for
La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 that sheds light on the distribution of coexisting phases and
uncovers a novel and unexpected phase. Using electron holography and Fresnel
imaging, we find micron sized ferromagnetic regions spanning several grains
coexisting with similar sized regions with no local magnetisation. Holography
shows that the ferromagnetic regions have a local magnetisation of 3.4 +- 0.2
mB/Mn (the spin aligned value is 3.5 mB/Mn). We use electron diffraction and
dark field imaging to show that charge order exists in regions with no net
magnetisation and, surprisingly, can also occur in ferromagnetic regions.

destruction of the topological order associated with stripe phases is about the
simplest theory controlled by local symmetry: Ising gauge theory. This first
part is intended to be a tutorial- we will exploit the simple physics of the
stripes to vividly display the mathematical beauty of the gauge theory.
Stripes, as they occur in the cuprates, are clearly `topological' in the sense
that the lines of charges are at the same time domain walls in the
antiferromagnet. Imagine that the stripes quantum melt so that all what seems
to be around is a singlet superconductor. What if this domain wall-ness is
still around in a delocalized form? This turns out to be exactly the kind of
`matter' which is described by the Ising gauge theory. The highlight of the
theory is the confinement phenomenon, meaning that when the domain wall-ness
gives up it will do so in a meat-and-potato phase transition. We suggest that
this transition might be the one responsible for the quantum criticality in the
cuprates. In part two, we will become more practical, arguing that another
phase is possible according to the theory. It might be that this quantum
spin-nematic has already been observed in strongly underdoped LSCO.

dealing with spacetimes having spherical symmetry (or some preferred spatial

propagation in a Schwarzschild black hole spacetime. The 1+3 covariant approach
is extended to a `1+1+2 covariant sheet' formalism by introducing a radial unit
vector in addition to the timelike congruence, and decomposing all covariant
quantities with respect to this. The background Schwarzschild solution is
discussed and a covariant characterisation is given. We give the full
first-order system of linearised 1+1+2 covariant equations, and we show how, by
introducing (time and spherical) harmonic functions, these may be reduced to a
system of first-order ordinary differential equations and algebraic constraints
for the 1+1+2 variables which may be solved straightforwardly. We show how both
the odd and even parity perturbations may be unified by the discovery of a
covariant, frame- and gauge-invariant, transverse-traceless tensor describing
gravitational waves, which satisfies a covariant wave equation equivalent to
the Regge-Wheeler equation for both even and odd parity perturbations. We show
how the Zerilli equation may be derived from this tensor, and derive a similar
transverse traceless tensor equivalent to this equation. The so-called
`special' quasinormal modes with purely imaginary frequency emerge naturally.
The significance of the degrees of freedom in the choice of the two frame
vectors is discussed, and we demonstrate that, for a certain frame choice, the

kernel for two examples: hot flat space and optical Schwarzschild metric. In
this paper we consider noise kernels for a scalar field in the Schwarzschild
black hole. Much of the work in the point separation approach is to determine
how the divergent piece conformally transforms. For the Schwarzschild metric we
find that the fluctuations of the stress tensor of the Hawking flux in the far

still lacks a rigorous proof, as in his original work the direct use of the

significant error in the noise kernel on the Schwarzschild horizon. As before

To this end, we first analyze $< T_{\mu\nu}(x) T_{\alpha\beta}(x') >$, the
two-point function of the stress tensor of the radiation field. In this we
generalize the work undertaken by Carlitz and Willey. To further analyze how
the vacuum correlations on $I^-$ are scattered by the mirror and redistributed
among the produced pairs of particles, we use a more powerful approach based on
the value of $T_{\mu\nu}$ which is conditional to the detection of a given
particle on $I^+$. We apply both methods to the fluxes emitted by a uniformly
accelerated mirror. This case is particularly interesting because of its strong
interferences which lead to a vanishing flux, and because of its divergences
which are due to the infinite blue shift effects associated with the horizons.
Using the conditional value of $T_{\mu\nu}$, we reveal the existence of
correlations between created particles and their partners in a domain where the
mean fluxes and the two-point function vanish. This demonstrates that the
scattering by an accelerated mirror leads to a steady conversion of vacuum
fluctuations into pairs of quanta. Finally, we study the scattering by two
uniformly accelerated mirrors which follow symmetrical trajectories (i.e. which
possess the same horizons). When using the Davies-Fulling model, the Bogoliubov
coefficients encoding pair creation vanish because of perfectly destructive
interferences. When using regularized amplitudes, these interferences are
inevitably lost thereby giving rise to pair creation.

typically incorporate thin plastic foil radiators and gas-filled x-ray
detectors, and are sensitive up to \gamma ~ 10^4. To reach higher Lorentz
factors (up to \gamma ~ 10^5), thicker, denser radiators can be used, which
consequently produce x-rays of harder energies (>100 keV). At these energies,
scintillator detectors are more efficient in detecting the hard x-rays, and
Compton scattering of the x-rays out of the path of the particle becomes an
important effect. The Compton scattering can be utilized to separate the
transition radiation from the ionization background spatially. The use of
conducting metal foils is predicted to yield enhanced signals compared to
standard nonconducting plastic foils of the same dimensions. We have designed
and built a Compton Scatter TRD optimized for high Lorentz factors and exposed
it to high energy electrons at the CERN SPS. We present the results of the
accelerator tests and comparisons to simulations, demonstrating 1) the
effectiveness of the Compton Scatter TRD approach; 2) the performance of

significantly. Our results indicate that a theoretical prior on the preferred

the Dirac magnetic monopole. When a Dirac-Wilson line forms a Dirac-Wilson
loop, it is a photon. This loop model of photon is exactly solvable. From the
winding numbers of this loop-form of photon, we derive the quantization
properties of energy and electric charge. A new QED theory is presented that is
free of ultraviolet divergences. The Dirac-Wilson line is as the quantum photon
propagator of the new QED theory from which we can derive known QED effects
such as the anomalous magnetic moment and the Lamb shift. The one-loop
computation of these effects is simpler and is more accurate than that in the
conventional QED theory. Furthermore, from the new QED theory, we have derived

the difficulties of the BS equation and gives a modified ground state of the
positronium. By the mentioned new QED effect and by the new formulation of the

natural quantum systems. Here we explore the new notion that synthetic quantum
systems suitable for quantum computation may be fabricated from smart
nanostructures using topological excitations of a stochastic neural-type
network that can mimic natural quantum systems. These developments are a
technological application of process physics which is an information theory of
reality in which space and quantum phenomena are emergent, and so indicates the
deep origins of quantum phenomena. Analogous complex stochastic dynamical
systems have recently been proposed within neurobiology to deal with the
emergent complexity of biosystems, particularly the biodynamics of higher brain
function. The reasons for analogous discoveries in fundamental physics and
neurobiology are discussed.

is a strategy commonly followed by animals which cannot rely on visual sense or
hearing. In this article we consider the possibility to detect the source of a
localized stimulus that travels along a chain of detectors at constant speed.
The detectors are autonomous oscillators whose frequencies have a given natural
spread. The detection mechanism is based on phase coherence which is built up
by phase resetting induced by the passing stimulus.

single photons with high probability, while simultaneously suppressing the
probability of yielding two or more photons. Because of this, single photon
sources cannot really produce single photons on demand. We describe a
multiplexed system that allows the probabilities of producing one and more
photons to be adjusted independently, enabling a much better approximation of a
source of single photons on demand. The scheme uses a heralded photon source
based on parametric downconversion, but by effectively breaking the trigger
detector area into multiple regions, we are able to extract more information
about a heralded photon than is possible with a conventional arrangement. This
scheme allows photons to be produced along with a quantitative
``certification'' that they are single photons. Some of the single-photon
certifications can be significantly better than what is possible with
conventional downconversion sources (using a unified trigger detector region),
as well as being better than faint laser sources. With such a source of more
tightly certified single photons, it should be possible to improve the maximum
secure bit rate possible over a quantum cryptographic link. We present an
analysis of the relative merits of this method over the conventional
arrangement.

in the same mathematical framework within which they can be compared. In that
framework, Bohmian mechanics and decoherent histories represent a given history
by different operators. Their predictions for the probabilities of histories
therefore generally differ. However, in an idealized model of measurement, the
predictions of Bohmian mechanics and decoherent histories coincide for the
probabilities of records of measurement outcomes. The formulations are thus
difficult to distinguish experimentally. They may differ in their accounts of
the past history of the universe in quantum cosmology.
