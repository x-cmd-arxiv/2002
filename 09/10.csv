pairs streaming out from the polar cap region. Pair formation, an essential
condition for pulsar radio emission, is believed to be sustained in active
pulsars via one photon process from either the curvature radiation (CR) or the
inverse Compton scattering (ICS) seed photons, or sometimes via two photon
process. In pulsars with super-critical magnetic fields, some more exotic
processes, such as magnetic photon splitting and bound pair formation, will
also play noticeable roles. All these effects should be synthesized to discuss
radio pulsar death both in the conventional long-period regime due to the
turnoff of the active gap, and in the high magnetic field regime due to the
possible suppression of the free pair formation. Here I briefly review some
recent progress in understanding radio pulsar death.

CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) on-board the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO).
The spectral resolution and sensitivity of the ACIS instrument have both been
evolving over the course of the mission. The spectral resolution of the
frontside-illuminated (FI) CCDs changed dramatically in the first month of the
mission due to radiation damage. Since that time, the spectral resolution of
the FI CCDs and the backside-illuminated (BI) CCDs have evolved gradually with
time. We demonstrate the efficacy of charge-transfer inefficiency (CTI)
correction algorithms which recover some of the lost performance. The detection
efficiency of the ACIS instrument has been declining throughout the mission,
presumably due to a layer of contamination building up on the filter and/or
CCDs. We present a characterization of the energy dependence of the excess
absorption and demonstrate software which models the time dependence of the
absorption from energies of 0.4 keV and up. The spectral redistribution
function and the detection efficiency are well-characterized at energies from
1.5 to 8.0 keV. The calibration at energies below 1.5 keV is challenging
because of the lack of strong lines in the calibration source and also because
of the inherent non-linear dependence with energy of the CTI and the absorption
by the contamination layer. We have been using data from celestial sources with
relatively simple spectra to determine the quality of the calibration below 1.5
keV. The analysis of these observations demonstrate that the CTI correction
recovers a significant fraction of the spectral resolution of the FI CCDs and
the models of the time-dependent absorption result in consistent measurements
of the flux at low energies for data from a BI (S3) CCD.

the scale dependence of the tensor to scalar amplitudes ratio, $r$, and how the

where $r$ converges to a constant value during inflation but dynamics are
rather different from the power--law model. Cases are presented where a
constant $r$ is not characteristic of the inflationary dynamics though the
resulting perturbation spectra are consistent with the CMB and LSS data.
  The inflaton potential corresponding to $r$ given by a n--th order polynomial
of the e--folds number is derived in quadratures expressions. Since the
observable difference between the spectral indices evaluated at a pivot scale
yields information about the linear term of that polynomial, the first order
case is explicitly written down. The solutions show features beyond the
exponential form corresponding to power--law inflation and can be matched with
current observational data.

just below the stellar/substellar boundary. None of the LMTTs in Taurus are
rapidly rotating (vsini < 30 km/s), unlike low mass objects in Orion. Many of
the slowly rotating, non-accreting stars and brown dwarfs exhibit prominent
H-alpha emission (EWs of 3 - 36 A), indicative of active chromospheres. We
demonstrate empirically that the full-width at 10% of the H-alpha emission
profile peak is a more practical and possibly more accurate indicator of
accretion than either the equivalent width of H-alpha or optical veiling:
10%-widths > 270 km/s are classical T Tauri stars (i.e. accreting), independent
of stellar spectral type. Although LMTTs can have accretion rates comparable to
that of more typical, higher-mass T Tauri stars (e.g. K7-M0), the average mass
accretion rate appears to decrease with decreasing mass. The diminished
frequency of accretion disks for LMTTs, in conjunction with their lower, on
average, mass accretion rates, implies that they are formed with less massive
disks than higher-mass T Tauri stars. The radial velocities, circumstellar
properties and known binaries do not support the suggestion that many of the
lowest mass members of Taurus have been ejected from higher stellar density
regions within the cloud. Instead, LMTTs appear to have formed and are evolving
in the same way as higher-mass T Tauri stars, but with smaller disks and
shorter disk lifetimes.

through an extensive set of numerical N-body simulations. Our simulations use a
rigid potential field for the halos and bulges and collisionless particles for
the disks. The triaxiality and the rotation rate of the halo are varied, as
well as the masses of all three galaxy components. We analyze both the bar
stability and spiral response of the disk under these conditions.
  We characterize most of our models by the mass ratio of the disk to the halo
at 2.3 disk scale lengths, (M_d/M_h)_Rsun. For models with a mass ratio greater
than 0.8, a halo pattern speed Omega_h = 6.7 km/s/kpc, and an
intermediate-to-major axis ratio q_b=0.85, a strong bar will develop within 3
Gyr, even for models with a bulge mass M_b=0.3M_d. Models in which the bulge
mass is reduced by half develop bars earlier and with lower Omega_h.
  We create an artificial Hubble sequence of galaxies by varying the
bulge-to-disk ratio of our models from 0 to 2.5. The torque induced by a
rotating, non-axisymmetric halo creates bisymmetric spiral structure in the
disk. We find the the pitch angle of the spiral arms in these models follows
the same general trend found in observations of spiral galaxies, namely that
later type galaxies have higher pitch angles. Our simulations follow closely
the observational relation of spiral pitch angle with maximum rotational
velocity of the disk, where galaxies with faster rotation have more tightly
wound spiral arms. This relation is followed in our simulations regardless of
whether the dominating mass component of the galaxy is the disk, the halo, or
the bulge.

formation models. It contains information on cosmological parameters and
detailed halo properties that cannot be extracted from the two-point

calculate the three-point correlation function (3PCF) for general cosmological
fields. We present detailed results for the configuration dependence of the
3-dimensional mass and galaxy distributions and the 2-dimensional cosmic shear
field. We work in real space, where higher order correlation functions on small
scales are easier to measure and interpret, but halo model calculations get
rapidly intractable. Hence we develop techniques for accurate evaluations of
the 1, 2 and 3-halo contributions to the 3PCF.
  The 3PCF violates the hierarchical ansatz in both its scale and configuration
dependence. We study the behavior of the coefficient Q in the hierarchical
expansion from large, quasilinear scales down to about 20 kpc. We find that the
nonlinear 3PCF is sensitive to the halo profile of massive halos, especially
its inner slope. We model the distribution of galaxies in halos and show that
the 3PCF of red galaxies has a weaker configuration and scale dependence than
the mass, while for blue galaxies it is very sensitive to the parameters of the
galaxy formation model. The 3PCF from weak lensing on the other hand shows
different scalings due to projection effects and a sensitivity to cosmological
parameters.

determined by fitting the upper giant branch of (K_s, J-K_s) colour-magnitude
diagrams to a dereddened upper giant branch mean locus built from previously
studied Bulge fields. The extinction values vary from A_K=0.05 in the edges of
the map up to A_K=3.2 close to the Galactic centre. The 2MASS extinction map
was compared to that recently derived from DENIS data. Both maps agree very
well up to A_K=1.0. The 2MASS extinction values were also compared to those
obtained from dust emission in the far infrared using DIRBE/IRAS. Several
systematic effects likely to bias this comparison were addressed, including the
presence of dust on the background of the bulk of 2MASS stars used in the
extinction determination. For the region with $3^{\circ}<|b|<5^{\circ}$, where
the dust contribution on the far side of the Galaxy is $\approx$ 5%, the two
extinction determinations correlate well, but the dust emission A_K values are
systematically higher than those from 2MASS. A calibration correction factor of
76% for the DIRBE/IRAS dust emission extinction is needed to eliminate this
systematic effect. Similar comparisons were also carried out for the
$1^{\circ}<|b|<3^{\circ}$ and $|b| < 0.5^{\circ}$ strips. An asymmetry relative
to the Galactic plane is observed in the dust maps, roughly in the sense that
A_K values are 60% smaller in the south than in the north for
$1^{\circ}<|b|<5^{\circ}$. This asymmetry is due to the presence of foreground
dust clouds mostly in the northern region of the Bulge.

features of the magnification probability distribution function (pdf) of SNe in
the framework of on average Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) models
for both lensing by large-scale structures and compact objects. The
magnification pdf is strongly dependent on the equation of state, $w_Q$, of the
quintessence. The dispersion increases with the redshift of the source and is
maximum for dark energy with very large negative pressure; the effects of
gravitational lensing on the magnification pdf, i.e. the mode biased towards
de-amplified values and the long tail towards large magnifications, are reduced
for both microscopic DM and quintessence with an intermediate $w_Q$. Different
equations of state of the dark energy can deeply change the dispersion in
amplification for the projected observed samples of SNe Ia by future space-born
missions. The ""noise"" in the Hubble diagram due to gravitational lensing
strongly affects the determination of the cosmological parameters from SNe
data. The errors on the pressureless matter density parameter, $\Omega_M$, and
on $w_Q$ are maximum for quintessence with not very negative pressure. The
effect of the gravitational lensing is of the same order of the other
systematics affecting observations of SNe Ia. Due to the lensing by large-scale
structures, in a flat Universe with $\Omega_M =0.4$, at $z=1$ a cosmological
constant ($w_Q=-1$) can be interpreted as dark energy with $w_Q <-0.84$ (at

image much of the extended structure of the radio jet in both the A and B

enable us to further constrain the lens model for the purposes of H0
determination. We are able to identify several sub-components common to both

lensing galaxy or a third image. Using a model of the lensing galaxy we have
back-projected both of the images to the source plane and find that they agree
well. However, there are small, but significant, differences which we suggest
may arise from multi-path scattering in the ISM of the lensing galaxy. We also
find an exponent of the radial mass distribution of approximately 1.04, in
agreement with lens modelling of published 15-GHz VLBI data. Polarisation maps

the evolution of the cosmic star formation density in cold dark matter

obtained from a set of hydrodynamic simulations which include star formation
and feedback. At early times, densities are sufficiently high and cooling times
sufficiently short that abundant quantities of star-forming gas are present in
all dark matter halos that can cool by atomic processes. Consequently, the star
formation density generically rises exponentially as z decreases, independent
of the details of the physical model for star formation, but dependent on the
normalisation and shape of the cosmological power spectrum. This part of the
evolution is dominated by gravitationally driven growth of the halo mass
function. At low redshifts, densities decline as the universe expands to the
point that cooling is inhibited, limiting the amount of star-forming gas
available. We find that in this regime the star formation rate scales
approximately in proportion to the cooling rate within halos. We derive
analytic expressions for the full star formation history and show that they
match our simulation results to better than ~10%. Using various approximations,
we reduce the expressions to a simple analytic fitting function that can be
used to compute global cosmological quantities that are directly related to the
star formation history. As examples, we consider the integrated stellar
density, the supernova and gamma-ray burst rates observable on Earth, the metal
enrichment history of the Universe, and the density of compact objects.

field using neutron and X-ray diffraction techniques. In zero field,
incommensurate (IC) SDW order appears below ~ 40 K, which is characterized by
neutron diffraction peaks at (1/2 +/- 0.134, 1/2 +/- 0.134, 0). The intensity
of these IC peaks increases rapidly below T_Nd ~ 8 K due to an ordering of the
Nd^3+ spins. The application of a 1 T magnetic field parallel to the c-axis
markedly diminishes the intensity below T_Nd, while only a slight decrease in
intensity is observed at higher temperatures for fields up to 7 T. Our
interpretation is that the c-axis field suppresses the parasitic Nd^3+ spin
order at the incommensurate wave vector without disturbing the stripe order of
Cu^2+ spins. Consistent with this picture, the CDW order, which appears below
60 K, shows no change for magnetic fields up to 4 T. These results stand in
contrast to the significant field-induced enhancement of the SDW order observed

differences can be understood in terms of the relative volume fraction

RuSr$_{2}$GdCu$_{2}$O$_{8}$. The magnetism clearly arises from the RuO$_{6}$
octahedra where the moments on neighboring Ru sites order antiferromagnetically
but cant perpendicular to the AFM axis - and so induce a weak ferromagnetism.
The projected Ru moments along the AFM and FM axes result in magnetic moments
of 1.16 and 0.99 $\mu_{B}$ respectively. The results are consistent with the
possible coexistence of canted ferromagnetism and superconductivity in the
RuSr$_{2}$GdCu$_{2}$O$_{8}$ - inferred from experiments.

the nucleon resonance region is found to agree with that measured in
deep-inelastic scattering at the same values of the Bjorken scaling variable

diagrams. The key point is the observation that the corresponding cross
sections exponentiate in the case of two eikonal lines, and that the exponent
is directly related to the functions A(\alpha_s) due to the factorization
properties of parton distribution functions. As examples, we rederive the one-
and two-loop coefficients A^(1) and A^(2). We go on to derive the known general
formula for the contribution to A^(n) proportional to N_f^{n-1}, where N_f
denotes the number of flavors. Finally, we determine the previously
uncalculated term proportional to N_f of the three-loop coefficient A^(3) to
illustrate the method. Our answer agrees with the existing numerical estimate.
The exact knowledge of the coefficients A^(n) is important for the resummations
of large logarithmic corrections due to soft radiation. Although only the
singular part of the splitting functions is calculable within our method,
higher-order computations are much less complex than within conventional
methods, and even the calculation of A^(4) may be possible.

multiplicative renormalization together with ghost-decoupling is to hold, the

diagonalizing the first nontrivial element of a bosonic tower of commuting

direct approach amounts to symmetrize products of non-symmetric Jack

cosmological constant in 3+1 dimensions. Both old and new results are
described, which support the case that loop quantum gravity provides a
satisfactory quantum theory of gravity. These include the existence of a ground
state, discoverd by Kodama, which both is an exact solution to the constraints
of quantum gravity and has a semiclassical limit which is deSitter spacetime.
The long wavelength excitations of this state are studied and are shown to
reproduce both gravitons and, when matter is included, quantum field theory on
deSitter spacetime. Furthermore, one may derive directly from the
Wheeler-deWitt equation, Planck scale, computable corrections to the
energy-momentum relations for matter fields. This may lead in the next few
years to experimental tests of the theory.
  To study the excitations of the Kodama state exactly requires the use of the
spin network representation, which is quantum deformed due to the cosmological
constant. The theory may be developed within a single horizon, and the boundary
states described exactly in terms of a boundary Chern-Simons theory. The
Bekenstein bound is recovered and the N bound of Banks is given a background
independent explanation.

medium is studied theoretically. We show that the necessary conditions for
these effects to be observable are realized in a three-level $\Lambda$-system
interacting with a linearly polarized laser beam in the presence of a static
magnetic field. In low power regime, when all other nonlinear processes are
negligible, the light-induced Zeeman coherence cancels the resonant absorption
of the medium almost completely, but preserves the dispersion anomalous and
very high. As a result, a superluminal light pulse propagation can be observed
in the sense that the peak of the transmitted pulse exits the medium before the
peak of the incident pulse enters. There is no violation of causality and
energy conservation. Moreover, the superluminal effects are prominently
manifested in the reshaping of pulse, which is caused by the
intensity-dependent pulse velocity. Unlike the shock wave formation in a
nonlinear medium with normal dispersion, here, the self-steepening of the pulse
trailing edge takes place due to the fact that the more intense parts of the
pulse travel slower. The predicted effect can be easily observed in the well
known schemes employed for studying of nonlinear magneto-optical rotation. The
upper bound of sample length is found from the criterion that the pulse
self-steepening and group-advance time are observable without pulse distortion
caused by the group-velocity dispersion.

coarser grid levels, this new scheme does not require the calculation of a
residue. Instead it works with copies of the charge density on the different
grid levels that were obtained from the underlying charge density on the finest
grid by wavelet transformations. This scheme is not limited to the pure wavelet
setting, where it is faster than the preconditioned conjugate gradient method,
but equally well applicable for finite difference discretizations.
