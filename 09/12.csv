source has been perplexing for some 20 years. Unlike other, better understood
X-ray pulsars, AXPs cannot be powered by rotation or by accretion from a binary
companion, hence the designation ``anomalous.'' AXP rotational and radiative
properties are strikingly similar to those of another class of exotic objects,
the Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs). However, the defining property of SGRs, namely
their low-energy gamma-ray and X-ray bursts, have heretofore not been seen in
AXPs. SGRs are thought to be ``magnetars,'' young neutron stars powered by the
decay of an ultra-high magnetic field. The suggestion that AXPs are magnetars
has been controversial. Here we report the discovery, from the direction of AXP
1E 1048-5937, of two X-ray bursts that have many properties similar to those of
SGR bursts. These events imply a close relationship between AXPs and SGRs, with
both being magnetars.

distribution of the unusually regular cD cluster Abell 2029. This system is
especially well-suited for analysis of its mass distribution under the
assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium: it exhibits an undisturbed X-ray
morphology and a single-phase ICM. We estimate the total mass, and the
contributions of the gas and dark matter components from <3 arcsec to ~3 arcmin
(<4.4-260 kpc, 0.001-0.1 r_vir). The gas density is well fitted by either a
double beta-model, or a ``cusped'' beta-model. The temperature data are
increasing, and can be approximated by a power-law, with alpha_T = 0.27+/-0.01.
  Fitting smooth functions to density and T, we obtain a mass profile, which is
remarkably well described down to 0.002 r_vir by the NFW model, for which we
measure r_scale = 540+/-90 kpc (~0.2 r_vir) and c = 4.4 +/- 0.9. The mass
profile is also approximated by a power-law fit with alpha_m = 1.81+/-0.04

profile is too shallow to be fitted with a Moore et al. model. The consistency
with NFW at <0.01 r_vir is incompatible with SIDM, and contrasts with the
results from rotation curves of LSB and dwarf galaxies. This suggests that
while CDM may adequately describe clusters, it does not currently account
properly for small halos.
  Using the cD light, we observe a total M/L_V ~ 12 at r < 20 kpc, rising to >
100 beyond 200 kpc. The consistency with an NFW halo model and the large M/L
suggest the cluster is DM-dominated down to <~ 0.005 r_vir. We observe a gas

(SSP) models are calibrated for the first time up to solar metallicity with a
sample of Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) which includes the metal rich GCs

galaxies. It is shown that the Bulge GCs and integrated light follow the same
correlation between Mg and Fe indices of elliptical galaxies, showing weaker Fe
indices at given Mg indices with respect to models that assume solar-scaled
abundances. This similarity is the robust empirical evidence for enhanced
alpha/Fe ratios in the stellar populations of elliptical galaxies, since the
globular clusters are independently known to be alpha-enhanced. The uniqueness
of this alpha-overabundance solution is checked by exploring the whole range of
model ingredients. We argue that the standard models reproduce the Mg-Fe
correlation at low metallicities because the stellar templates used in the
synthesis are the alpha-enhanced stars of the galactic Halo. These same models,
however, fail to recover the Mg-Fe pattern of Bulge clusters and ellipticals at
high metallicities because the high-metallicity templates are disk stars, which
are not alpha-enhanced. The new SSP models by Thomas, Maraston & Bender (2002)
which incorporate the dependence on alpha/Fe reproduce the Mg and Fe indices of
GCs at all metallicities, with alpha/Fe=+0.3, which is in agreement with
spectroscopic abundance determinations. The Balmer indices (Hbeta, Hdelta,
Hgamma) are very well calibrated, provided the Horizontal Branch morphology is
taken into account. In particular, we reproduce the Balmer lines of NGC 6388

considerably harder spectra, with an average $\Gamma\sim1.0$ assuming no

coincidental, with the 5-10 keV surveys gaining approximately as many hard
sources as they lose soft ones, when compared to the 2-10 keV surveys. This is
hard to reconcile with standard AGN ``population synthesis'' models for the
X-ray background, which posit the existence of a large population of absorbed

the exception that the few very brightest objects are anomalously soft. 53 of

driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. In the other way, both the

presence crucially changes the mechanism of the fireball deceleration by an
external medium. At late stages of the explosion, neutrons fully decouple from
ions and coast with a constant Lorentz factor \Gamma_n. As the ion fireball
decelerates, the neutrons form a leading front. This front gradually decays,
leaving behind a trail of decay products mixed with the ambient medium. The
kinetic energy of the decay products far exceeds the medium rest-mass energy,
and the trail has a high Lorentz factor at radii R < R_{trail} = 10R_\beta

shock wave in it. Thus, observed afterglow emission is produced in the neutron
trail. It can naturally re-brighten or display a spectral transition at R
\approx R_{trail} where the impact of neutrons turns off. Absence of any
neutron signatures would point to an extremely low baryon loading of the

significantly for these sightlines, indicating that Complex C is not well
characterized by a single metallicity. Reliable metallicities based on [OI/HI]
range from 0.1-0.25 solar. Metallicities based on [SII/HI] range from 0.1-0.6
solar, but the trend of decreasing abundance with HI column density indicates
that photoionization corrections may affect the conversion to [S/H]. We present
models of the dependence of the ionization correction on HI column density;
these ionization corrections are significant when converting ion abundances to
elemental abundances for S, Si, and Fe. The measured abundances in this survey
indicate that parts of the cloud have a higher metallicity than previously
thought and that Complex C may represent a mixture of ``Galactic fountain'' gas
with infalling low-metallicity gas. We find that [S/O] and [Si/O] have a solar
ratio, suggesting little dust depletion. Further, the measured abundances
suggest an over-abundance of O, S, and Si relative to N and Fe. The enhancement
of these alpha-elements suggests that the bulk of the metals in Complex C were
produced by Type II supernovae and then removed from the star-forming region,
possibly via supernovae-driven winds or tidal stripping, before the ISM could
be enriched by N and Fe.

energies > 1 PeV, while without this component effective energy losses of
protons begin only at E > 10^{18} eV. We develop a model describing the
production and escape of neutrons from a comoving spherical blob, which
continue to interact with the ambient external radiation field on the
parsec-scale broad line region (BLR). Neutrons may carry ~10% of the overall
energy of the protons accelerated beyond E ~ 1 PeV outside the BLR. Ultra-high
energy (UHE) gamma rays produced in photomeson interactions of neutrons outside
the blob can also escape the BLR. The escaping neutrons, gamma rays and
neutrinos form a collimated neutral beam with a characteristic opening angle ~
1/Gamma, where Gamma is the bulk Lorentz factor of the inner jet. The energy
and the momentum of such beam is then mostly deposited in the extended jet due
to neutron decay at distances ~ (E_n/10^{17} eV}) kpc, and through
pair-production attenuation of gamma rays with energies E_g ~ 10^{15}-10^{18}
eV which can propagate to distances beyond (10-100) kpc. In this scenario,
neutral beams of UHE gamma rays and neutrons can be the reason for straight
extended jets such as in Pictor A. Fluxes of neutrinos detectable with km-scale
neutrino telescopes are predicted from flat spectrum radio quasars such as 3C
279.

above the GZK cutoff there is growing interest in the ones that represent
kinematical solutions, based either on general formulations of particle physics
with small violations of Lorentz symmetry or on a quantum-gravity-motivated
scheme for the breakup of Lorentz symmetry. An unappealing aspect of these
cosmic-ray-puzzle solutions is that they require the existence of a preferred
class of inertial observers. Here I propose a new kinematical solution of the
cosmic-ray puzzle, which does not require the existence of a preferred class of
inertial observers. My proposal is a new example of a type of relativistic
theories, the so-called ""doubly-special-relativity"" theories, which have
already been studied extensively over the last two years. The core ingredient
of the proposal is a deformation of Lorentz transformations in which also the
Planck scale $E_p$ (in addition to the speed-of-light scale $c$) is described
as an invariant. Just like the introduction of the invariant $c$ requires a
deformation of the Galileian transformations into the Lorentz transformations,
the introduction of the invariant $E_p$ requires a deformation of the Lorentz
transformations, but there is no special class of inertial observers. The
Pierre Auger Observatory and the GLAST space telescope should play a key role
in future developments of these investigations. I also emphasize that the
doubly-special-relativity theory here proposed, besides being the first one to
provide a solution for the cosmic-ray puzzle, is also the first one in which a
natural description of macroscopic bodies is achieved, and may find
applications in the context of a recently-proposed dark-energy scenario.

theoretical estimates of the energy associated with the production of the

over 0 < z < 5 is reasonably well constrained.
  The study of emission line gas in galaxies as a function of redshift provides
a complementary view of chemical evolution to that obtained from studies of
absorption line systems in quasar spectra. Emission line gas is more relevant
for some questions, including the confrontation with models for the chemical
evolution of our own and other galaxies, and Origins-related questions about
the formation of stars and planets. Using relatively crude diagnostic
parameters such as Pagel's R23, the increase of the metallicity of star-forming
gas with cosmic epoch can be tracked. Observations of a large sample of CFRS
galaxies at z ~ 0.8 (a look-back time of 0.5 t0 show the appearance of a
significant number of low metallicity systems amongst luminous L* galaxies.
However, overall there is only a modest change in mean metallicity compared
with the present, D log Z = -0.08 +- 0.06. These data do not support a
fading-dwarf scenario for the ``faint blue galaxies''. At z ~ 3 it is likely
that all star-forming galaxies have sub-solar metallicities. The overall
increase in the metallicity of star-forming gas with cosmic epoch matches
rather well the age-metallicity relation in the solar neighbourhood and some
recent models for the evolution of the global metallicity of gas in the
Universe.

scales, probably predominantly by supernovae. The scaling properties of
supersonic turbulence are well described by a new analytical theory. The
distribution of proto-stellar core masses depends primarily on the power
spectrum of the turbulent flow, and on the jump conditions for near isothermal
shocks in a magnetized gas. For the predicted velocity power spectrum index
beta=1.74, consistent with results of numerical experiments of supersonic
turbulence as well as with Larson's velocity-size relation, one obtains by
scaling arguments a power law mass distribution of dense cores with a slope
equal to 3/(4-beta) = 1.33, consistent with the slope of the Salpeter stellar
initial mass function (IMF). Results from numerical simulations confirm this
scaling. Both the analytical model for the stellar IMF and its numerical

fluctuations and have different couplings to gravitational waves and to the

interferometric combinations LISA will be able to synthesize, we have
identified a triplet of interferometric combinations that show optimally
combined sensitivity. As an application of the method, we computed the
sensitivity improvement for sinusoidal sources in the nominal, equal-arm LISA
configuration. In the part of the Fourier band where the period of the wave is
longer than the typical light travel-time across LISA, the sensitivity gain
over a single Michelson interferometer is equal to $\sqrt{2}$. In the mid-band
region, where the LISA Michelson combination has its best sensitivity, the
improvement over the Michelson sensitivity is slightly better than $\sqrt{2}$,
and the frequency band of best sensitivity is broadened. For frequencies
greater than the reciprocal of the light travel-time, the sensitivity
improvement is oscillatory and $\sim \sqrt{3}$, but can be greater than
$\sqrt{3}$ near frequencies that are integer multiples of the inverse of the
one-way light travel-time in the LISA arm.

its future null infinity. In the present article, we mainly consider spacetimes
with two black holes. Although, in most of cases, the black holes coalesce and
their event horizon is topologically a single sphere far in the future, there
are several possibilities that the black holes do not coalesce eternally and
such exact solutions. In our formulation, the geometrical structure of future
null infinity is related to the topological structure of the upper end of the
future null infinity through the Poincare\'-Hopf's theorem. Since the upper end
of the future null infinity determines the event horizon far in the future
under the conformal embedding, the topology of event horizon far in the future
will be affected by the geometrical structure of the future null infinity. Our
method is not only for the case of black hole coalescence. Also we can consider
more than two black holes or a black hole with non-trivial topology.

conversion. The LMA MSW solution with $\Delta m^2 = (5 - 7) \cdot 10^{-5}$
eV$^2$, $\tan^2 \theta = 0.35 - 0.45$ looks rather plausible: it fits well the
experimental data and our new theoretical prejudices. In the LMA case, KamLAND
should see (0.5 - 0.7) reduced signal. VAC-QVO and LOW are accepted at about
$3\sigma$-level. The SMA solution is practically excluded. No sub-leading
effects produced by $U_{e3}$ and admixture of sterile neutrino have been found.
The fit becomes worse with increase of $U_{e3}$ (for LMA) and the $\nu_s$
admixture. Still (30 - 50)% presence of the sterile neutrino is allowed.
Solutions based on the neutrino spin-flip in the magnetic fields of the Sun as
well as on non-standard neutrino interactions give good fit of the data. If
KamLAND confirms LMA MSW, the spin-flip and non-standard interactions can be
considered (and will be searched for) as sub-leading effects.

quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for a finite value of the chemical potential and
for finite temperature. Studies have been made of the restoration of chiral
symmetry in matter and at finite temperature. The phenomenon of deconfinement
is also of great interest, with studies of the temperature dependence of the
confining interaction reported recently. In the present work we study the
change of the properties of light mesons as the temperature is increased. For
this study we make use of a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model that has been
generalized to include a covariant model of confinement. The parameters of the
confining interaction are made temperature-dependent to take into account what
has been learned in lattice simulations of QCD at finite temperature. The
constituent quark masses are calculated at finite temperature using the NJL
model. A novel feature of our work is the introduction of a temperature
dependence of the NJL interaction parameters. (This is a purely
phenomenological feature of our model, which we do not attempt to derive from
more fundamental considerations.) With the three temperature-dependent aspects
of the model mentioned above, we find that the mesons we study are no longer
bound when the temperature reaches the critical temperature, $T_c$, which we
take to be 170 MeV. We believe that ours is the first model that is able to
describe the interplay of chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement for
mesons at finite temperature. The introduction of temperature-dependent
coupling constants is a feature of our work whose further consequences should
be explored in future work.

turns out that in terms of spineless cacti Cohen's Gerstenhaber structure and

also prove that spineless cacti and cacti are homotopy equivalent to their

  Schroedinger systems","To appear in Nonlinearity",,"10.1088/0951-7715/15/6/319",,"nlin.PS",,"  An explanation is given for previous numerical results which suggest a
certain bifurcation of `vector solitons' from scalar (single-component)
solitary waves in coupled nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) systems. The bifurcation
in question is nonlocal in the sense that the vector soliton does not have a
small-amplitude component, but instead approaches a solitary wave of one
component with two infinitely far-separated waves in the other component. Yet,
it is argued that this highly nonlocal event can be predicted from a purely
local analysis of the central solitary wave alone. Specifically the
linearisation around the central wave should contain asymptotics which grow at
precisely the speed of the other-component solitary waves on the two wings.
This approximate argument is supported by both a detailed analysis based on
matched asymptotic expansions, and numerical experiments on two example
systems. The first is the usual coupled NLS system involving an arbitrary ratio
between the self-phase and cross-phase modulation terms, and the second is a
coupled NLS system with saturable nonlinearity that has recently been
demonstrated to support stable multi-peaked solitary waves. The asymptotic
analysis further reveals that when the curves which define the proposed
criterion for scalar nonlocal bifurcations intersect with boundaries of certain
local bifurcations, the nonlocal bifurcation could turn from scalar to
non-scalar at the intersection. This phenomenon is observed in the first
example. Lastly, we have also selectively tested the linear stability of
several solitary waves just born out of scalar nonlocal bifurcations. We found
that they are linearly unstable. However, they can lead to stable solitary
waves through parameter continuation.

give the parametric solution of the positive hierarchy. In particular, we
obtain the parametric solution of the equation $u_t=\pa^5_x u^{-{2/3}}$.

appearance of functional structures responsible for the improvements in the
learning process, as measured by the generalization capabilities of the
resulting algorithms. The effect of such appearances can be described as
dynamical phase transitions. The concepts of phenotypic and genotypic
entropies, which serve to describe the distribution of fitness in the
population and the distribution of symbols respectively, are used to monitor
the dynamics. In different runs the phase transitions might be present or not,
with the system finding out good solutions, or staying in poor regions of
algorithm space. Whenever phase transitions occur, the sequence of appearances
are the same. We identify combinations of variables and operators which are

luminescence of solids, in quantum dots and in molecular nanostructures, and
they also play a central role in light harvesting processes in photosynthetic
organisms. We demonstrate that such mechanisms, together with the
exciton-exciton binding energy shift typical of these nanostructures, can be
used to perform universal quantum logic. In particular, we show how to generate
controlled exciton entanglement and identify two different regimes of quantum
behaviour.

  self-interaction","30 pages, 18 figures, LaTeX file",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A low temperature model system consisting of a central spin coupled to a
spin-bath is studied to determine whether interaction among bath spins has an
effect on central spin dynamics. In the absence of intra-environmental
coupling, decoherence of the central spin is fast and irreversible. Strong
intra-environmental interaction results in an effective decoupling of the
central spin from the bath and suppression of decoherence. Weaker
intra-environmental coupling reduces but does not eliminate decoherence. We
believe that similar behaviour will be observed in any system with a
self-interacting environment.

quantum information theory and of the entropy of a subalgebra in quantum
ergodic theory. Both notions require optimization over decompositions of
quantum states. We show that both functionals are strongly related for some
highly symmetric density matrices. We discuss the presence of broken symmetries
in relation with the structure of the optimal decompositions.
