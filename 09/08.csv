observational consequences of accretion around supermassive black holes in
active galactic nuclei and neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes in x-ray
binary (XRB) systems. But despite more than three decades of study, the
structure and composition of these jets remain unknown. Here we present
spatially resolved x-ray spectroscopy of arc second-scale x-ray jets from the
XRB SS 433 analized with the Chandra advanced charge-coupled device imaging
spectrometer. These observations reveal evidence for a hot continuum and
Doppler-shifted iron emission lines from spatially resolved regions.
Apparently, in situ reheating of the baryonic component of the jets takes place
in a flow that moves with relativistic bulk velocity even more than 100 days
after launch from the binary core.

  Cosmic Microwave Background","12 pages,7 figures. Figures revised to reduce file size","SPIE Proceedings, Waikaloa 2002",,,"astro-ph physics.ins-det",,"  We have developed a bolometric detector that is intrinsically sensitive to
linear polarization which is optimized for making measurements of the
polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The receiver
consists of a pair of co-located silicon nitride micromesh absorbers which
couple anisotropically to linearly polarized radiation through a corrugated
waveguide structure. This system allows simultaneous background limited
measurements of the Stokes I and Q parameters over ~ 30% bandwidths at
frequencies from ~ 60 to 600 GHz. Since both linear polarizations traverse
identical optical paths from the sky to the point of detection, the
susceptibility to systematic effects is minimized. The amount of uncorrelated
noise between the two polarization senses is limited to the quantum limit of
thermal and photon shot noise, while drifts in the relative responsivity to
orthogonal polarizations are limited to the effect of non-uniformity in the
thin film deposition of the leads and the intrinsic thermistor properties.
Devices using NTD Ge thermistors have achieved NEPs of 2 x 10^{-17} W/sqrt{Hz}
with a 1/f knee below 100 mHz at a base temperature of 270 mK. Numerical
modelling of the structures has been used to optimize the bolometer geometry
and coupling to optics. Comparisons of numerical results and experimental data
are made. A description of how the quantities measured by the device can be
interpreted in terms of the Stokes parameters is presented. The receiver
developed for the Boomerang and Planck HFI focal planes is presented in detail.

dramatic effect on the photonic band structure. In the case of diamond and
zinc-blende photonic crystals, several complete photonic band gaps (CPBG's) can
open in the spectrum, between the 2nd-3rd, 5th-6th, and 8th-9th bands. Unlike
in the purely dielectric case, in the presence of small inclusions of a low
absorbing metal the largest CPBG for a moderate dielectric constant
(epsilon<=10) turns out to be the 2nd-3rd CPBG. The 2nd-3rd CPBG is the most
important CPBG, because it is the most stable against disorder. For a diamond
and zinc-blende structure of nonoverlapping dielectric and metallo-dielectric
spheres, a CPBG begins to decrease with an increasing dielectric contrast
roughly at the point where another CPBG starts to open--a kind of gap
competition. A CPBG can even shrink to zero when the dielectric contrast
increases further. Metal inclusions have the biggest effect for the dielectric
constant 2<=epsilon<=12, which is a typical dielectric constant at near
infrared and in the visible for many materials, including semiconductors and
polymers. It is shown that one can create a sizeable and robust 2nd-3rd CPBG at
near infrared and visible wavelengths even for a photonic crystal which is
composed of more than 97% low refractive index materials (n<=1.45, i.e., that
of silica glass or a polymer). These findings open the door for any
semiconductor and polymer material to be used as genuine building blocks for
the creation of photonic crystals with a CPBG and significantly increase the
possibilities for experimentalists to realize a sizeable and robust CPBG in the
near infrared and in the visible. One possibility is a construction method
using optical tweezers, which is analyzed here.

intense study for several decades. Thermoelectric properties, such as
thermopower and thermal conductivity, have been relatively neglected. A long
standing problem is represented by the sign of the thermoelectric power. In
crystalline semiconductors this is related to the sign of the majority
carriers, but in non-crystalline systems it is commonly observed to change sign
at low temperatures. In spite of its apparent universality this change has been
interpreted in a variety of ways in different systems. We have developed a
Green's function recursion algorithm based on the
Chester-Thelling-Kubo-Greenwood formula for calculating the kinetic
coefficients on long strips or bars. From these we can deduce the electrical
conductivity, the Seebeck and Peltier coefficients and the thermal
conductivity, as well as the Lorenz number. We present initial results for 1D
systems. We observe a Lorentzian distribution for the thermopower which is
modified by the presence of inelastic scattering. This could give rise to
non-negligible quantum fluctuations in macroscopic systems at low temperatures.
