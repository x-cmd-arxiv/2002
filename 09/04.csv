Early and Late type galaxies present in a redshift survey since these can then
be used in their respective redshift-independent distance estimators (Dn-sigma

relatively successfully separated into these two types by the use of various

Supergranulation and related scales of turbulent convection are likely to play
a significant role in the maintenance of such radial gradients, and may
influence dynamics on a global scale in ways that are not yet understood. To
investigate such dynamics, we have constructed a series of three-dimensional
numerical simulations of turbulent compressible convection within spherical
shells, dealing with shallow domains to make such modeling computationally
tractable. These simulations are the first models of solar convection in a
spherical geometry that can explicitly resolve both the largest dynamical
scales of the system (of order the solar radius) as well as smaller-scale
convective overturning motions comparable in size to solar supergranulation
(20--40 Mm). We find that convection within these simulations spans a large
range of horizontal scales, and that the radial angular velocity gradient in
these models is typically negative, especially in low- and mid-latitude
regions. Analyses of the angular momentum transport indicates that such
gradients are maintained by Reynolds stresses associated with the convection,
transporting angular momentum inward to balance the outward transport achieved
by viscous diffusion and large-scale flows in the meridional plane. We suggest
that similar mechanisms associated with smaller-scale convection in the sun may
contribute to the maintenance of the observed radial shear layer located
immediately below the solar photosphere.

of the ionizing radiation produced by stars are modeled with two free
parameters: (i) a transition redshift, z_tran, above which the stellar
population is dominated by massive, zero-metallicity stars and below which it
is dominated by a Scalo mass function; (ii) the product of the escape fraction
of stellar ionizing photons from their host galaxies and the star-formation

at high redshifts based on the lack of the HI Gunn-Peterson trough at z<6 and
the upper limit on the total intergalactic optical depth for electron
scattering, tau_es<0.18, from recent cosmic microwave background (CMB)

reionize hydrogen by themselves before z~6. A major fraction of the allowed
combinations of f_esc f_* and z_tran lead to an early peak in the ionized
fraction due to metal-free stars at high redshifts. This sometimes results in
two reionization epochs, namely an early HII or HeIII overlap phase followed by
recombination and a second overlap phase. Even if early overlap is not
achieved, the peak in the visibility function for scattering of the CMB often
coincides with the early ionization phase rather than with the actual
reionization epoch. Consequently, tau_es does not correspond directly to the

protoplanetary embryo is explored theoretically. We propose a method to
describe the evolution of the disk surface density, eccentricity, and
inclination caused by the embryo-planetesimal interaction. It relies on the
analytical treatment of the scattering in two extreme regimes of the
planetesimal epicyclic velocities: shear-dominated (dynamically ``cold'') and
dispersion-dominated (dynamically ``hot''). In the former, planetesimal
scattering can be treated as a deterministic process. In the latter, scattering
is mostly weak because of the large relative velocities of interacting bodies.
This allows one to use the Fokker-Planck approximation and the two-body
approximation to explore the disk evolution. We compare the results obtained by
this method with the outcomes of the direct numerical integrations of
planetesimal orbits and they agree quite well. In the intermediate velocity
regime an approximate treatment of the disk evolution is proposed based on
interpolation between the two extreme regimes. We also calculate the rate of
embryo's mass growth in an inhomogeneous planetesimal disk and demonstrate that
it is in agreement with both the simulations and earlier calculations. Finally
we discuss the question of the direction of the embryo-planetesimal interaction
in the dispersion-dominated regime and demonstrate that it is repulsive. This
means that the embryo always forms a gap in the disk around it, which is in
contrast with the results of other authors. The machinery developed here will
be applied to realistic protoplanetary systems in future papers.

planetesimal-planetesimal interactions, which increase random motions and
smooth gradients in the disk, and (2) gravitational scattering of planetesimals
by the embryo, which tends to heat up the disk locally and repels planetesimals
away. The embryo's growth is self-consistently coupled to the planetesimal disk
dynamics. We demonstrate that details of the evolution depend on only two
dimensionless parameters incorporating all the physical characteristics of the
problem: the ratio of the physical radius to the Hill radius of any solid body
in the disk and the number of planetesimals inside the annulus of the disk with
width equal to the planetesimal Hill radius. The results of exploration in the
framework of our model of several situations typical for protosolar nebula can
be summarized as follows: initially, the planetesimal disk dynamics is not
affected by the presence of the embryo and the growth of the embryo's mass
proceeds very rapidly in the runaway regime. Later on, when the embryo starts
being dynamically important, its accretion slows down similar to the
``oligarchic'' growth picture. The scenario of orderly growth suggested by
Safronov (1972) is never realized in our calculations; scenario of runaway
growth suggested by Wetherill & Stewart (1989) is only realized for a limited
range in mass. Slow character of the planetesimal accretion on the oligarchic
stage of the embryo's accumulation leads to a considerable increase of the
protoplanetary formation timescale compared to that following from a simple
runaway accretion picture valid in the homogeneous planetesimal disks.

of hard lag, i.e., the amplitude of the 3.2--10 keV photons lagging the lower
energy ones, tends to increase with the decreasing energy. In the Fourier
frequency domain, by investigating the cross-spectra of the 0.1--2/2--10 keV

lags at the lowest frequencies. However, with the present data, it is
impossible to constrain the dependence of the lags on frequencies even though
the detailed simulations demonstrate that the hard lags at the lowest
frequencies probed by the flare are not an artifact of sparse sampling, Poisson
and red noise. As a possible interpretation, the implication of the hard lags
is discussed in the context of the interplay between the (diffusive)
acceleration and synchrotron cooling of relativistic electrons responsible for
the observed X-ray emission. The energy-dependent hard lags are in agreement
with the expectation of an energy-dependent acceleration timescale. The
inferred magnetic field (B ~ 0.11 Gauss) is consistent with the value inferred
from the Spectral Energy Distributions of the source. Future investigations

to produce larger [(Zn, Co, V)/Fe] and smaller [(Mn, Cr)/Fe], which could
explain the trend observed in very metal-poor stars. 2) Because of enhanced
$\alpha$-rich freezeout, $^{44}$Ca, $^{48}$Ti, and $^{64}$Zn are produced more
abundantly than in normal supernovae. The large [(Ti, Zn)/Fe] ratios observed

Extending a previous analysis of Johansen and Sornette [1999, 2000] on the
Nikkei index ``anti-bubble'' based on a theory of cooperative herding and
imitation working both in bullish as well as in bearish regimes, we demonstrate
the existence of a clear signature of herding in the decay of the S&P500 index
since August 2000 with high statistical significance, in the form of strong
log-periodic components. We offer a detailed analysis of what could be the
future evolution of the S&P500 index over the next two years, according to
three versions of the theory: we expect an overall continuation of the bearish
phase, punctuated by local rallies; we predict an overall increasing market
until the end of the year 2002 or at the beginning of 2003 (first quarter); we
predict a strong following descent (with maybe one or two severe up and downs
in the middle) which stops during the first semester of 2004. After this strong
minimum, the market is expected to recover. Beyond, our prediction horizon is
made fuzzy by the possible effect of additional nonlinear collective effects
and of a real departure from the anti-bubble regime. The similarities between
the two stock market indices may reflect deeper similarities between the
fundamentals of two economies which both went through over-valuation with
strong speculative phases preceding the transition to bearish phases
characterized by a surprising number of bad surprises (bad loans for Japan and
accounting frauds for the US) sapping investors' confidence.

at $\Ms/2$ is found to vanish immediately if the randomness is switched on in
agreement with Totsuka's prediction. The small plateau also appears near the
saturation field due to the localization of inverted spins around the minority
bond. On the other hand, if the stronger bond is replaced by the ferromagnetic
bonds randomly, the randomness induced fractional plateau appears as in the
nonfrustrated case. The plateau at $\Ms/2$ does not simply vanish but shifts
and splits into two smaller plateaux. The magnetization on this plateau varies
nonlinearly with $1-p$. The physical origin of this behavior is explained based
on the strong coupling picture.

(low) conductivity for H-(L-)phase, respectively. The modification reduces a

The latter value explicitly depends on the average concentration gamma(p) of
the H-component per model cell. The effective conductivity as a function of
content p of the H-phase in such systems can be modelled making use of three
model parameters that are sensitive to both grain size distributions, GSD(H)

connected with a given GSD, a computer simulation of the geometrical
arrangement of grains is necessary. By controlling the polydispersity in grain
sizes and their relative area frequencies, the effective conductivity could be
raised or decreased and correlated with gamma(p). When the phases are
interchanged, a hysteresis-loop-like behaviour of the effective conductivity,

upper limit corresponds to a mean free path consistent with the Ioffe-Regel

known to use bandwidth inefficiently, there has been much research into shared
mesh protection, which promises significant bandwidth savings. Unfortunately,
most shared mesh protection schemes cannot guarantee that failed traffic will
be restored within the 50 ms timeframe that SONET standards specify. A notable
exception is the p-cycle scheme of Grover and Stamatelakis. We argue, however,
that p-cycles have certain limitations, e.g., there is no easy way to adapt
p-cycles to a path-based protection scheme, and p-cycles seem more suited to
static traffic than to dynamic traffic. In this paper we show that the key to
fast restoration times is not a ring-like topology per se, but rather the
ability to pre-cross-connect protection paths. This leads to the concept of a
pre-cross-connected trail or PXT, which is a structure that is more flexible
than rings and that adapts readily to both path-based and link-based schemes
and to both static and dynamic traffic. The PXT protection scheme achieves fast
restoration speeds, and our simulations, which have been carefully chosen using
ideas from experimental design theory, show that the bandwidth efficiency of
the PXT protection scheme is comparable to that of conventional shared mesh
protection schemes.

action in order to obtain coupled, nonperturbative equations for the mean field

of a quartically self-interacting O(N) field theory (with unbroken symmetry) in
spatially flat FRW spacetime, the dynamics of the mean field is studied
numerically, at leading order in the large-N expansion. The time evolution of
the scale factor is determined self-consistently using the semiclassical
Einstein equation. It is found that cosmic expansion can dramatically affect
the efficiency of parametric resonance-induced particle production. The
production of fermions due to the oscillating inflaton mean field is studied
for the case of a scalar inflaton coupled to a fermion field via a Yukawa
coupling $f$. The dissipation and noise kernels appearing at $O(f^2)$ in the
one-loop CTP effective action are shown to satisfy a zero-temperature
fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR). The effective stochastic equation
obeyed by the inflaton zero mode at $O(f^4)$ contains multiplicative noise. It
is shown that stochasticity becomes important to the dynamics of the inflaton
zero mode before the end of reheating. The thermalization problem is discussed,
and a strategy is presented for obtaining time-local equations for equal-time
correlation functions which goes beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation.

depend on the structure of the binary's members. If the binary contains neutron
stars, measuring such waves can teach us about the properties of matter at
extreme densities. Unfortunately, these waves are typically at high frequency
where the sensitivity of broad-band detectors is not good. Learning about dense
matter from these waves will require networks of broad-band detectors combined
with narrow-band detectors that have good sensitivity at high frequencies. This
paper presents an algorithm by which a network can be ``tuned'', in accordance
with the best available information, in order to most effectively measure
merger waves. The algorithm is presented in the context of a toy model that
captures the qualitative features of narrow-band detectors and of certain
binary neutron star merger wave models. By using what is learned from a

accurately measure the waves. The number of measurements needed to reach this

the waves that carry the merger information. Future studies will go beyond this

the trajectory. Conventionally, the dynamics of test particles as observed in
4D is discussed on the basis of the splitting of the geodesic equation in 5D.
However, this procedure is {\em not} unique and therefore leads to some
problems. The most serious one is the ambiguity in the definition of rest mass
in 4D, which is crucial for the discussion of the dynamics. We propose the
Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, instead of the geodesic one, to study the dynamics

the rest mass and its variation along the motion as observed in 4D. It is
independent of the coordinates and any parameterization used along the motion.
Also, we are able to show a comprehensive picture of the various physical
scenarios allowed in 4D, without having to deal with the subtle details of the
splitting formalism. Moreover we study the extra non-gravitational forces
perceived by an observer in 4D who describes the geodesic motion of a bulk test
particle in 5D. Firstly, we show that the so-called fifth force fails to
account for the variation of rest mass along the particle's worldline.
Secondly, we offer here a new definition that correctly takes into account the
change of mass observed in 4D.

separations and propagation times at which string breaking occurs. The static

evidence for string breaking as the static quark potential completely saturates

altogether, the light-cone collapses completely. This is the Carrollian limit,

binary Markov process. Similarly, the wave equation can in the high frequency
limit be mapped onto a quantum graph. Implications of this result for the level
statistics are discussed. Furthermore, a periodic trace formula is derived from
the scattering matrix based on the inside-outside duality between eigen-modes
and scattering solutions and periodic orbits are identified by Fourier
transforming the spectral density

conditioning through repeated input of a limited number of of temporal

of the state can therefore be understood modewise; that is, a given mode on one

the total bi-partite entanglement is the sum of the modewise entanglement. This
decomposition is generally not applicable to all mixed Gaussian states.
