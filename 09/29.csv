particle and nuclear physics point of view. From the elementary particle point
of view it pops up in almost every model. giving rise, among others, to the
following mechanisms: a) The traditional contributions like the light neutrino
mass mechanism . b) The exotic R-parity violating supersymmetric (SUSY)
contributions. Similar considerations apply to its sister lepton and muon
number violating muon to positron conversion. The observation of neutrinoless
double beta decay will signal that the neutrinos are massive Majorana
particles. For nuclear physics it is challenging, because: 1) The nuclei, which
can undergo double beta decay, have complicated structure. 2) The energetically
allowed transitions are suppressed. 3) One must cope with the short distance
behavior of the transition operators. Thus novel effects (decay of pions in
flight between nucleons etc) have to be considered. 4) One has to take into
account possible momentum dependent terms of the nucleon current. For light
neutrinos such modifications of the nucleon current reduce the nuclear matrix
elements by about 25 per cent. In the case of heavy neutrino the effect is much
larger and model dependent. With the above effects the nuclear matrix elements
for all interesting nuclei A = 76, 82, 96, 100, 116, 128, 130, 136 and 150 are
discussed. Some have been obtained in the shell model but most in QRPA. Thus we
have extracted new limits on the various lepton violating parameters. We find
an average neutrino mass of about 0.5eV and, for reasonable choices of the
parameters of SUSY models, we get a stringent limit on the R-parity violating
parameter less than 0.00068.

  France, July 18-24, 2002. To appear in the proceedings (Nucl. Phys. A)","Nucl.Phys.A715:757-760,2003","10.1016/S0375-9474(02)01482-3",,"nucl-ex",,"  The PHENIX detector at RHIC measured high p_T identified hadron ratios in
sqrt(s_NN) = 200GeV Au+Au collisions. Within the current systematic and
statistical errors, pbar/p ratios that are measured up to 3.8GeV/c are almost
independent of both p_T and centrality. The baryon to meson ratio is measured
through p/pi and pbar/pi ratios up to 3.8GeV/c, showing they are strongly
centrality dependent.

radiation reaction force appearing when a relativistic charged particle moves
along a periodic structure without external fields is investigated. It is shown
that the non-synchronous spatial harmonics of Cherenkov-type radiation (CR) can
give rise to the oscillation of a particle which consequently generates
undulator-type radiation (UR). In the spectral region, where the diffraction of
generated waves is essential, the radiation manifests itself in the coherent
interference of CR and UR. A pure undulator -type radiation takes place only in
the wavelength range where the wave diffraction can be neglected. In the case
of coherent UR by a bunch of N electrons, the UR power is proportional to N in
the forth degree.

solutions to the wave equation for arbitrary frequencies and adjustable
bandwidth. The formulation presented here is rather simple, and its results can
be expressed in terms of the ordinary, so-called ""X-shaped waves"". Moeover, by
the present formalism we obtain the first analytical localized Superluminal
approximate solutions which represent beams propagating in dispersive media.
Our solutions may find application in different fields, like optics,
microwaves, radio waves, and so on. [PACS nos.: 03.50.De ; 41.20.Jb ; 83.50.Vr

"quant-ph/0209160","Leble Sergey","A. Halim, S. Kshevetskii, S. Leble","On numerical integration of coupled Korteweg-de Vries System",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  We introduce a numerical method for general coupled Korteweg-de Vries
systems. The scheme is valid for solving Cauchy problems for arbitrary number
of equations with arbitrary constant coefficients. The numerical scheme takes
its legality by proving its stability and convergence which gives the
conditions and the appropriate choice of the grid sizes. The method is applied
to Hirota-Satsuma (HS) system and compared with its known explicit solution
investigating the influence of initial conditions and grid sizes on accuracy.
We also illustrate the method to show the effects of constants with a
transition to the non-integrable case.
