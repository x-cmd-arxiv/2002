source count model of Rowan-Robinson (2001) is improved in two ways. First,
density evolution is incorporated to correspond to the mergers in hierarchical
models of galaxy formation. Secondly, the evolution of dust opacity is taken
into account. The luminosity and density evolution parameters and the
characteristic opacity of the local universe are allowed to vary freely and the
best overall fit to the B band is determined. This parameter set is then
translated to other wavebands, showing significant improvement of goodness of
fit in the optical, UV and near-IR bands, whilst retaining the goodness of fit
in the far-IR and submillimetre bands of the original model. A significant
fraction of the improvement of fit is shown to be due to the introduction of
optical depth history. The mean value of Av in the local universe for the
best-fitting model is 0.4. The goodness of fit to available star formation
history data is not significantly altered and the form of the evolution of the
luminosity function shown to be consistent with a semi-analytic, forward
evolution model.

modulated by ~83% at a period of 2.78 hr (10017 s) in an XMM-Newton observation
taken 2002 Jan 6-7. The X-ray intensity dips show no energy dependence. We
detected weaker dips with the same period in observations taken 2000 June 25
(XMM-Newton) and 1991 June 26 (ROSAT/PSPC). The amplitude of the modulation has
been found to be anticorrelated with source X-ray flux: it becomes lower when
the source intensity rises. The energy spectrum of Bo158 was stable from
observation to observation, with a characteristic cutoff at ~4-6 keV. The
photo-electric absorption was consistent with the Galactic foreground value. No
significant spectral changes were seen in the course of the dips. If the 2.78
hr cycle is the binary period of Bo158 the system is highly compact, with a
binary separation of ~10e11 cm. The association of the source with a globular
cluster, together with spectral parameters consistent with Galactic neutron
star sources, suggests that X-rays are emitted by an accreting neutron star.
The properties of Bo 158 are somewhat reminiscent of the Galactic X-ray sources
exhibiting a dip-like modulations. We discuss two possible mechanisms
explaining the energy-independent modulation observed in Bo 158: i) the
obscuration of the central source by highly ionized material that scatters
X-rays out of the line of sight; ii) partial covering of an extended source by
an opaque absorber which occults varying fractions of the source.

ratio, R, of the corotation radius to the length of the bar semi-major axis.
For all the galaxies, R is consistent with being in the range from 1.0 and 1.4,
i.e. that they host fast bars. This represents the largest sample of galaxies
for which R has been measured this way. Taking into account the measured
distribution of R and our measurement uncertainties, we argue that this is

Tremaine-Weinberg method finds a distribution of R which is in agreement with
that obtained by hydrodynamical simulations. We compared this result with
recent high-resolution N-body simulations of bars in cosmologically-motivated
dark matter halos,and conclude that these bars are not located inside centrally

problems. Up to the present most photoionization codes have numerically solved
the equations of radiative transfer by making the extreme simplifying
assumption of spherical symmetry. Unfortunately very few real astronomical
nebulae satisfy this requirement. To remedy these shortcomings, a
self-consistent, three-dimensional radiative transfer code has been developed
using Monte Carlo techniques. The code, Mocassin, is designed to build
realistic models of photoionized nebulae having arbitraries geometry and
density distributions with both the stellar and diffuse radiation fields
treated self-consistently. In addition, the code is capable of tretating on or
more exciting stars located at non-central locations. The gaseous region is
approximated by a cuboidal Cartesian grid composed of numerous cells. The
physical conditions within each grid cell are determined by solving the thermal
equilibrium and ionization balance equations This requires a knowledge of the
local primary and secondary radiation fields, which are calculated
self-consistently by locally simulating the individual processes of ionization
and recombination. The main structure and computational methods used in the
Mocassin code are described in this paper. Mocassin has been benchmarked
against established one-dimensional spherically symmetric codes for a number of
standard cases, as defined by the Lexington/Meudon photoionization workshops

objects at a given black hole mass ranging over 7 orders of magnitude in radio
power. We have been able to tie in the population of powerful radio sources

direct handle on the extent to which the accelerated electrons are beamed,
which, in turn, has important implications for particle acceleration models.
Past efforts to measured X-ray polarization have met with only limited success.
Although designed primarily as a hard X-ray imager and spectrometer, the Ramaty
High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) is also capable of measuring
the polarization of hard X-rays (20-100 keV) from solar flares. This capability
arises from the inclusion of a small unobstructed Be scattering element that is
strategically located within the cryostat that houses the array of nine
germanium detectors. The Ge detectors are segmented, with both a front and rear
active volume. Low energy photons (below about 100 keV) can reach a rear
segment of a Ge detector only indirectly, by scattering. Low energy photons
from the Sun have a direct path to the Be and have a high probability of
Compton scattering into a rear segment of a Ge detector. The azimuthal
distribution of these scattered photons carries with it a signature of the
linear polarization of the incident flux. Sensitivity estimates, based on Monte
Carlo simulations and in-flight background measurements, indicate that a 20-100
keV polarization sensitivity of less than a few percent can be achieved for
X-class flares.

III objects thermalized by conducting cosmic graphite/iron needle-shaped dust.
Due to lack of an accurate solution to the absorption properties of exceedingly
elongated grains, in existing literature which studies the CMB thermalizing
process they are generally modelled as (1) needle-like spheroids in terms of
the Rayleigh approximation; (2) infinite cylinders; and (3) the antenna theory.
We show here that the Rayleigh approximation is not valid since the Rayleigh
criterion is not satisfied for highly conducting needles. We also show that the
available intergalactic iron dust, if modelled as infinite cylinders, is not
sufficient to supply the required opacity at long wavelengths to obtain the
observed isotropy and Planckian nature of the CMB. If appealing to the antenna
theory, conducting iron needles with exceedingly large elongations (10^4)
appear able to provide sufficient opacity to thermalize the CMB within the iron
density limit. But the applicability of the antenna theory to exceedingly thin
needles of nanometer/micrometer in thickness needs to be justified.

curvature radius independently of its being hyperbolic, flat, or spherical.
Whatever the curvature, the universe may have either a simply connected or a
multiply connected topology. In the flat case, the topology scale is arbitrary,
and there is no a priori reason for this scale to be of the same order as the
size of the observable universe. In the hyperbolic case any nontrivial topology
would almost surely be on a length scale too large to detect. In the spherical
case, by contrast, the topology could easily occur on a detectable scale. The
present paper shows how, in the spherical case, the assumption of a nearly flat
universe simplifies the algorithms for detecting a multiply connected topology,
but also reduces the amount of topology that can be seen. This is of primary
importance for the upcoming cosmic microwave background data analysis.
  This article shows that for spherical spaces one may restrict the search to
diametrically opposite pairs of circles in the circles-in-the-sky method and
still detect the cyclic factor in the standard factorization of the holonomy
group. This vastly decreases the algorithm's run time. If the search is widened
to include pairs of candidate circles whose centers are almost opposite and
whose relative twist varies slightly, then the cyclic factor along with a
cyclic subgroup of the general factor may also be detected. Unfortunately the
full holonomy group is, in general, unobservable in a nearly flat spherical
universe, and so a full 6-parameter search is unnecessary. Crystallographic
methods could also potentially detect the cyclic factor and a cyclic subgroup
of the general factor, but nothing else.

are used, as well as a probabilistic law of image enhancement for various

probability density of a product of random quantities. It is shown that the
slope of this function ranges from -1 to -2 for faint quasars, like that for
ordinary galaxies. In the case of bright quasars, the slope of the apparent
brightness distribution function is determined mainly by the lensing effect and
has a lower limit of -3. The good agreement between theory and observations
suggests that statistically quasars are gravitationally enhanced images of the
active nuclei of distant galaxies. If the initial assumptions are correct, then
the luminosity function of galaxies and the apparent brightness function for
quasars are not independent but are related by means of the differential
lensing probability.

off-centered with respect to the center of symmetry of the whole galaxy and it
shows a much lower ellipticity with respect to the rest of the galaxy.
Moreover, UMi stars are shown to be clustered according to two different

very symmetric and smooth density profile. The possible consequences of this

source population in the vicinity of the radio galaxy MRC 1138-262. Many
serendipitous X-ray sources are detected in an area of 8'x8' around the radio
source and 90% are identified in our deep VLT images. The space density of such
sources is higher than expected on the basis of the statistics of ROSAT and
Chandra deep surveys. The most likely explanation is in terms of a
concentration of AGN associated with the protocluster at z=2.16 which was found
around the radio galaxy in previous studies. Two sources have a confirmed
spectroscopic redshift close to that of the radio galaxy, and for three more
sources other observations suggest that they are associated with the
protocluster. Four of these five X-ray sources form, together with the radio
galaxy, a filament in the plane of the sky. The direction of the filament is
similar to that of the radio source axis, the large scale distribution of the
other protocluster members, the 150 kpc-sized emission-line halo and the
extended X-ray emission associated with the radio galaxy.
  The majority of optically identified X-ray sources in this field have
properties consistent with type I AGN, a few could be soft, low luminosity
galaxies, one is probably an obscured (type II) AGN and one is a star. These
statistics are consistent with the results of deep X-ray surveys.

populations, and taking into account the observational uncertainties. We assume
a recent burst of star formation superimposed on a more evolved population. The
effects of the nebular continuum, line emission and dust attenuation are taken
into account. We also test different model assumptions including the choice of
specific evolutionary synthesis model, initial mass function, star formation
scenario and the treatment of dust extinction. Quantitative tests are applied
to determine how well these models fit our multi-wavelength observations for
the UCM sample. Our observations span the optical and near infrared, including
both photometric and spectroscopic data. Our results indicate that extinction
plays a key role in this kind of studies, revealing that low- and
high-extinction objects may require very different extinction laws and must be
treated differently. We also demonstrate that the UCM Survey galaxies are best
described by a short burst of star formation occurring within a quiescent
galaxy, rather than by continuous star formation. A detailed discussion on the
inferred parameters, such as the age, burst strength, metallicity, star
formation rate, extinction and total stellar mass for individual objects, is

of young stars is responsible for the Halpha emission used to detect the
objects in the UCM Survey. We also infer total stellar masses and star
formation rates in a consistent way taking into account the evolutionary
history of each galaxy. We find that an average UCM galaxy has a total stellar
mass of ~1E10 Msun, of which about 5% has been formed in an instantaneous burst
occurred about 5 Myr ago, and sub-solar metallicity. Less than 10% of the
sample shows massive starbursts involving more than half of the total mass of
the galaxy. Several correlations are found among the derived properties. The
burst strength is correlated with the extinction and with the integrated
optical colours for galaxies with low obscuration. The current star formation
rate is correlated with the gas content. A stellar mass-metallicity relation is
also found. Our analysis indicates that the UCM Survey galaxies span a broad
range in properties between those of galaxies completely dominated by
current/recent star formation and those of normal quiescent spirals. We also
find evidence indicating that star-formation in the local universe is dominated
by galaxies considerably less massive than L*.

  From a ROSAT-PSPC map we find that the X-ray surface brightness distribution
of A3560 is well described by two components, an elliptical King law and a more
peaked and fainter structure, which has been modeled with a Gaussian. The main
component, corresponding to the cluster, is elongated with the major axis
pointing toward the A3558 complex. The second component, centered on the
Dumb-bell galaxy which dominates the cluster, appears significantly offset (by
about 0.15 Mpc) from the cluster X-ray centroid.
  From a Beppo-SAX observation we derive the radial temperature profile,
finding that the temperature is constant (at kT~3.7 keV) up to 8 arcmin,
corresponding to 0.3 Mpc: for larger distances, the temperature significantly
drops to kT~1.7 keV. We analyze also temperature maps, dividing the cluster in
4 sectors and deriving the temperature profiles in each sector: we find that
the temperature drop is more sudden in the sectors which point towards the
A3558 complex.
  From VLA radio data, at 20 and 6 cm, we find a peculiar bright extended radio
source (J1332-3308), composed by a core (centered on the northern component of

morphology of the source could be interpreted either with a strong interaction

observational tool at hand for modern cosmology. It allows to break the
degeneracy of fundamental cosmological parameters one cannot obtain using only
anisotropy data and provides new insight into conditions existing in the very
early Universe. Many experiments are now in progress whose aim is detecting
anisotropy and polarization of the CMB. Measurements of the CMB polarization
are however hampered by the presence of polarized foregrounds, above all the
synchrotron emission of our Galaxy, whose importance increases as frequency
decreases and dominates the polarized diffuse radiation at frequencies below
$\simeq 50$ GHz. In the past the separation of CMB and synchrotron was made
combining observations of the same area of sky made at different frequencies.
In this paper we show that the statistical properties of the polarized
components of the synchrotron and dust foregrounds are different from the
statistical properties of the polarized component of the CMB, therefore one can
build a statistical estimator which allows to extract the polarized component
of the CMB from single frequency data also when the polarized CMB signal is
just a fraction of the total polarized signal. This estimator improves the
signal/noise ratio for the polarized component of the CMB and reduces from
about 50 GHz to about 20 GHz the frequency above which the polarized component
of the CMB can be extracted from single frequency maps of the diffuse
radiation.

as a function of the metallicity [Fe/H] is discussed and compared to that of
other heavy elements beyond iron. We also estimate spatial velocities and
galactic orbital parameters for our target stars in order to disentangle the
population of disk stars from that of halo stars using kinematic criteria. In
the absence of a firm a priori knowledge of the nucleosynthesis mechanisms
controlling Cu and Zn production, and of the relative stellar sites, we derive
constraints on these last from the trend of the observed ratios [Cu/Fe] and
[Zn/Fe] throughout the history of the Galaxy, as well as from a few well
established properties of basic nucleosynthesis processes in stars. We thus
confirm that the production of Cu and Zn requires a number of different sources
(neutron captures in massive stars, s-processing in low and intermediate mass
stars, explosive nucleosynthesis in various supernova types). We also attempt a
ranking of the relative roles played by different production mechanisms, and
verify these hints through a simple estimate of the galactic enrichment in Cu
and Zn. In agreement with suggestions presented earlier, we find evidence that
Type Ia Supernovae must play a relevant role, especially for the production of
Cu.

and a small gap, Delta_S~2.4 meV. The SIS break junctions show clearly that the
small gap closes near the bulk critical temperature, T_c=39 K. The SIS spectra
allow proximity effects to be ruled out as the cause for the small gap and
therefore make a strong case that MgB_2 is a coupled, two-band superconductor.

conductance from both bands, it is more often found that Delta_S dominates the

growth of complex networks that give rise to power-law distributions. These
models are based on the notion of preferential attachment leading to the ``rich

limited size of networks such as protein and e-mail networks. Such networks may
in fact exhibit an exponential cutoff in the power-law scaling, although this

model, so that after a node is chosen preferentially, say according to the
number of its inlinks, there is a small probability that this node will be
discarded. We show that as a result of this modification, by viewing the
stochastic process in terms of an urn transfer model, we obtain a power-law

model can capture instances where the exponent of the distribution is less than

transitions, which are actually allowed by higher-order processes or other

these tests to the quantum states in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), which
are regarded as artificial atoms. Electrons in a QD occupy quantized states in
the same manner as electrons in real atoms. However, unlike real atoms, the
confinement potential of the QD is anisotropic, and the electrons can easily
couple with phonons of the material. Understanding the selection rules for such
QDs is an important issue for the manipulation of quantum states. Here we
investigate allowed and forbidden transitions for phonon emission in one- and
two-electron QDs (artificial hydrogen and helium atoms) by electrical
pump-and-probe experiments, and find that the total spin is an excellent
quantum number in artificial atoms. This is attractive for potential

The work is divided into two main parts. In the first part we study the general
existence of Kerr-Schild motions --a recently introduced metric motion. We show
that generically, Kerr-Schild motions give rise to finite dimensional Lie
algebras and are isometrizable, i.e., they are in a one-to-one correspondence
with a subset of isometries of a (usually different) spacetime. This is similar
to conformal motions. There are however some exceptions that yield infinite
dimensional algebras in any dimension of the manifold. We also show that
Kerr-Schild motions may be interpreted as some kind of metric symmetries in the
sense of having associated some geometrical invariants. In the second part, we
suggest a scheme able to cope with other new candidates of metric motions from
a geometrical viewpoint. We solve a set of new candidates which may be
interpreted as the seeds of further developments and relate them with known
methods of finding new solutions to Einstein's field equations. The results are
similar to those of Kerr-Schild motions, yet a richer algebraical structure
appears. In conclusion, even though several points still remain open, the

generated in first approximation by introducing fermion condensates on the same
lines as was done before for gluons, within the modified perturbative expansion
for QCD proposed in former works. Thus, the results point in the direction of
the conjectured link of the approximate `Democratic' symmetry of the quark mass
matrix and `gap' effects similar to the ones occuring in superconductivity. The
condensates are introduced here non-dynamically and therefore the question of
the possibility for their spontaneous generation remains open. However,
possible ways out of the predicted lack of the `Democratic' symmetry of the
condensates resulting from the spontaneous breaking of the flavour symmetry are
suggested. They come from an analysis based on the Cornwall--Jackiw--Tomboulis
(CJT) effective potential for composite operators

elastic proton-nucleus scattering observables uses a global Dirac
phenomenological (DP) approach based on the Relativistic Impulse Approximation
(RIA). Data sets for Ca40, Ca48 and Pb208 in the energy range from 500 MeV to
1040 MeV are considered. The global fits are successful in reproducing the data
and in predicting data sets not included in the analysis. Using this global
approach, energy independent neutron densities are obtained. The vector point
proton density distribution is determined from the empirical charge density
after unfolding the proton form factor. The other densities are parametrized.
  This work provides energy independent values for the RMS neutron radius, R_n
and the neutron skin thickness, S_n, in contrast to the energy dependent values
obtained by previous studies. In addition, the results presented in paper show
that the expected rms neutron radius and skin thickness for Ca40 is accurately
reproduced. The values of R_n and S_n obtained from the global fits that we
consider to be the most reliable are given as follows: for Ca40 R_n is 3.314 >
R_n > 3.310 fm and S_n is -0.063 > S_n > -0.067 fm; for Ca48 R_n is 3.459 > R_n
> 3.413 fm and S_n is 0.102 > S_n > 0.056 fm; and for Pb208 R_n is 5.550 > R_n
> 5.522 and S_n is 0.111 > S_n > 0.083 fm. These values are in reasonable
agreement with nonrelativistic Skyrme Hartree-Fock models and with relativistic
Hartree-Bogoliubov models with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings. The
results from the global fits for Ca48 and Pb208 are generally not in agreement
with the usual relativistic mean-field models.

show strong SU(3) symmetry breaking due mainly to the single-particle

values are insensitive to fragmentation of the SU(3) symmetry. Specifically,
the quadrupole collectivity as measured by B(E2) strengths remains high even

family of the orbits with reference to the largest one significantly improves
the eigenvalues of sphere and an exact comparison with the quantum mechanical

contributions of the equatorial, the planar (in the axis of symmetry plane) and
the non-planar(3-Dimensional) orbits are obtained from the same trace formula
by using the appropriate conditions. The resulting eigenvalues compare very
well with the quantum mechanical eigenvalues at normal deformation. It is
interesting that the partial sum of equatorial orbits leads to eigenvalues with
maximum angular momentum projection, while the summing of planar orbits leads
to eigenvalues with $L_z=0$ except for L=1. The remaining quantum mechanical
eigenvalues are observed to arise from the 3-dimensional(3D) orbits. Very few
spurious eigenvalues arise in these partial sums. This result establishes the
important role of 3D orbits even at normal deformations.

plans to measure the expected Standard Model asymmetry of ~10^-7 to an accuracy

requires for operation an intense circularly polarized laser beam and the

Quad-cavity, with its quadrupole mode at beam operating frequency, extracts the
beam quad-moment exclusively, utilizing the symmetry of the cavity and some
simple networks to suppress common modes. Six successive beam quadrupole moment
measurements, performed at different betatron phases in a linear transport
