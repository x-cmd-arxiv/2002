20298+3559, which was identified by a cross-correlation of cold compact sources
from the 170 micron ISOPHOT Serendipity Survey (ISOSS) database coinciding with
objects detected by the MSX, 2MASS and IRAS infrared surveys. ISOSS J
20298+3559 is associated with a massive dark cloud complex (M ~ 760
M$_{\odot}$) and located in the Cygnus X giant molecular cloud. We derive a
distance of 1800 pc on the basis of optical extinction data. The low average
dust temperature (T ~ 16 K) and large mass (M ~ 120 M$_{\odot}$) of the dense
inner part of the cloud, which has not been dispersed, indicates a recent begin
of star formation. The youth of the region is supported by the early
evolutionary stage of several pre- and protostellar objects discovered across
the regio n: I) Two candidate Class 0 objects with masses of 8 and 3.5
M$_{\odot}$, II) a gravitationally bound, cold (T ~ 12 K) and dense (n(H$_{2}$)
\~ 2 x 10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) cloud core with a mass of 50 M$_{\odot}$ and III) a
Herbig B2 star with a mass of 6.5 M$_{\odot}$ and a bolometric luminosity of
2200 L$_{\odot}$, showing evidence for ongoing accretion and a stellar age of
less than 40000 years. The dereddened SED of the Herbig star is well reproduced
by an accretion disc + star model. The externally heated cold cloud core is a
good candidate for a massive pre-protostellar object. The star formation
efficiency in the central cloud region is about 14 %.

triplet-state pairing of neutrons with the $|m_J| = 2$ projection of the total
angular momentum of Cooper pairs onto quantization axis. The specific feature
of this pairing is that it leads to a power-law (nonexponential) reduction of
the emissivity of the main neutrino processes by neutron superfluidity. For a
wide range of neutron critical temperatures $T_{cn}$, the cooling of NSs with
the $|m_J| = 2$ superfluidity is either the same as the cooling with the $m_J =
0$ superfluidity, considered in the majority of papers, or much faster. The
cooling of NSs with density dependent critical temperatures $T_{cn}(\rho)$ and
$T_{cp}(\rho)$ can be imitated by the cooling of the NSs with some effective
critical temperatures $T_{cn}$ and $T_{cp}$ constant over NS cores. The
hypothesis of strong neutron superfluidity with $|m_J| = 2$ is inconsistent
with current observations of thermal emission from NSs, but the hypothesis of
weak neutron superfluidity of any type does not contradict to observations.

here in the light of new high-quality ultraviolet (UV) interstellar line data

component of interstellar absorption at a mean LSR velocity of $-$14 km
s$^{-1}$ indicates that the distance to QU Car may be $\sim$2 kpc or more -- a
considerable increase on the previous lower-limiting distance of 500 pc. If so,
the bolometric luminosity of QU Car could exceed $10^{37}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. This
would place this binary in the luminosity domain occupied by known
compact-binary supersoft X-ray sources. Even at a 500 pc, QU Car appears to be
the most luminous nova-like variable known.
  New intermediate dispersion optical spectroscopy of QU Car spanning
3800--7000 \AA is presented. These data yield the discovery that C{\sc iv}
$\lambda\lambda$5801,12 is present as an unusually prominent emission line in
an otherwise low-contrast line spectrum. Using measurements of this and other
lines in a recombination line analysis, it is shown that the C/He abundance as
proxied by the n(C$^{4+}$)/n(He$^{2+}$) ratio may be as high as 0.06 (an order
of magnitude higher than the solar ratio). Furthermore, the C/O abundance ratio
is estimated to be greater than 1. These findings suggest that the companion in
QU Car is a carbon star. If so, it would be the first example of a carbon star
in such a binary. An early-type R star best matches the required abundance
pattern and could escape detection at optical wavelengths provided the distance
to QU Car is $\sim$2 kpc or more.

ordered ground state phase at small layer separations the Hartree-Fock data
compare reasonably with the exact results. Above the critical layer separation,
however, the Hartree-Fock findings still predict an increase in the ground
state energy, while the exact ground state energy is in this regime independent
of the layer separation indicating the decoupling of layers and the loss of
spontaneous phase coherence between them. We also find accurate values for the
pseudospin anisotropy constant whose dependence of the layer separation
provides another very clear indication for the strong interlayer correlations
in the ordered phase and shows an inflection point at the phase boundary.
Finally we discuss the possibility of interlayer correlations in biased systems
even above the phase boundary for the balanced case. Certain features of our
data for the pseudospin anisotropy constant as well as for quantum fluctuations

the energy level statistics at the integer quantum Hall (QH) transition.
Previously it was demonstrated that the RG approach reproduces the critical
distribution of the {\em power} transmission coefficients, i.e., two-terminal
conductances, $P_{\text c}(G)$, with very high accuracy. The RG flow of $P(G)$
at energies away from the transition yielded the value of the critical
exponent, $\nu$, that agreed with most accurate large-size lattice simulations.
To obtain the information about the level statistics from the RG approach, we
analyze the evolution of the distribution of {\em phases} of the {\em
amplitude} transmission coefficient upon a step of the RG transformation. From
the fixed point of this transformation we extract the critical level spacing
distribution (LSD). This distribution is close, but distinctively different
from the earlier large-scale simulations. We find that away from the transition
the LSD crosses over towards the Poisson distribution. Studying the change of
the LSD around the QH transition, we check that it indeed obeys scaling
behavior. This enables us to use the alternative approach to extracting the
critical exponent, based on the LSD, and to find $\nu=2.37\pm0.02$ very close
to the value established in the literature. This provides additional evidence
for the surprising fact that a small RG unit, containing only five nodes,
accurately captures most of the correlations responsible for the
localization-delocalization transition.

ranges with negative specific heat and temperature jumps at transition

the theory of Nersesyan {\em et al.}. For strong disorder, a qualitative change
to an energy independent DoS occurs.

core of the associated hyperbolic 3-manifold $M$ and give coordinates for the
non-Fuchsian groups $\QF - \F$. The pleating invariants of a component of
$\bch$ consist of the projective class of its bending measure, together with
the lamination length of a fixed choice of transverse measure in this class.
Our description complements that of Minsky in \cite{MinskyPT}, in which he
describes the space of all punctured torus groups in terms of {\em ending
invariants} which characterize the asymptotic geometry of the ends of $M$.
  Pleating invariants give a quasifuchsian analog of the Kerckhoff-Thurston

critical lines extend to {\em pleating planes} on which the pleating loci of
$\bch$ are constant and the horocycles extend to {\em BM-slices} on which the
pleating invariants of one component of $\bch$ are fixed.

dense and that their boundaries can be found {\em explicitly}. This means,
answering questions posed by Bers in the late 1960's, that it is possible to

1974 by F. Iachello and A. Arima and then extended by numerous papers.
Many-body configurations with s- and d-boson states are described and creation-
and annihilation-operators for bosons are introduced. States with defined total
angular momentum are dealt with and the Hamilton operator of the IBM1-model is
expressed in terms of Casimir operators. Level energies and electromagnetic
transition probabilities are compared with measured data. A short introduction
to Lie algebras and their application to the IBM1-model are given. In the IBM2-
model protons and neutrons are treated separately and in IBFM single nucleons
are added to the boson model. Comparison with experimental results.

cases agreement is not so good, but the behaviour of the binding energy with
increasing baryon number is in qualitative agreement with data. Charmed or
beauty hypernuclei within this approach are predicted to be bound stronger than
strange hypernuclei. This conclusion is stable against variation of poorly
known heavy flavor decay constants.

  Published on Communications in Theoretical Physics","Commun. Theor. Phys. 45 (2006) 527-534",,,"nucl-th",,"  According to Wick's theorem, the second order self-energy corrections of
hadrons in the hot and dense nuclear matter are calculated. Furthermore, the
Feynman rules are summarized, and an effective formulation on quantum
hadrodynamics at finite temperatures and densities is evaluated. As the strong
couplings between nucleons are considered, the self-consistency of this method
is discussed in the framework of relativistic mean-field approximation. Debye
screening masses of the scalar and vector mesons in the hot and dense nuclear
matter are calculated with this method in the relativistic mean-field
approximation. The results are different from those of thermofield dynamics and
Brown-Rho conjecture. Moreover, the effective masses of the photon and the
nucleon in the hot and dense nuclear matter are discussed.

1 square micrometer (or nanometer). The channeled beam can be deflected and
thus well separated in angle and space from the primary and scattered
particles. Monte Carlo simulation is done to evaluate the characteristics of a
channeled microbeam. Emittances down to 0.1-0.001 nanometer radian, and flux up
to 1 million particles per square micron per second, can be achieved for
protons and ions.

entanglement by the class of one-way protocols converted from stabilizer codes
for a certain class of states is equal to or greater than the achievable rate
of stabilizer codes over the channel corresponding to the distilled state, and
they can distill asymptotically more entanglement from a very noisy Werner
state than the hashing protocol.

approximately or exactly with some probability. There are two types of cloners:
universal and state-dependent cloner. The optimal universal cloner has been
found and could be viewed as a special state-dependent quantum cloner which has
no information about the states. In this paper, we investigate the
state-dependent cloning when the state-set contains more than two states. We
get some bounds of the global fidelity for these processes. This method is not
dependent on the number of the states contained in the state-set. It is also
independent of the numbers of copying.
