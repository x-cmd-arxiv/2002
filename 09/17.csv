square-degree field with a more sensitive narrow-field ""fovea"" imager. Coupled
to each telescope array is a real-time data analysis pipeline that is designed
to identify interesting transients on timescales of seconds and, when a
celestial transient is identified, to command the rapidly slewing robotic
mounts to point the narrow-field ``fovea'' imagers at the transient. The two
narrow-field telescopes then image the transient with higher spatial resolution
and at a faster cadence to gather light curve information. Each ""fovea"" camera
also images the transient through a different filter to provide color
information. This stereoscopic monitoring array is supplemented by a rapidly
slewing telescope with a low resolution spectrograph for follow-up observations
of transients and a sky patrol telescope that nightly monitors about 10,000
square-degrees for variations, with timescales of a day or longer, to a depth
about 100 times fainter. In addition to searching for fast transients, we will
use the data stream from RAPTOR as a real-time sentinel for recognizing
important variations in known sources. Altogether, the RAPTOR project aims to
construct a new type of system for discovery in optical astronomy--one that
explores the time domain by ""mining the sky in real time"".

coronal base (where, e.g., the mass flux is determined) and in the extended
acceleration region between 2 and 10 solar radii (where the plasma becomes
collisionless and individual particle species begin to exhibit non-Maxwellian
velocity distributions with different moments). The dissipation of
magnetohydrodynamic fluctuations (i.e., waves, turbulence, and shocks) is
believed to dominate the heating in the extended corona, and spectroscopic
observations from the UVCS instrument on SOHO have helped to narrow the field
of possibilities for the precise modes, generation mechanisms, and damping

claims that the standard value of $H_0$ favors a strangely small halo as
compact as the stellar light distribution with an overall nearly Keplerian
rotation curve. In an earlier paper (Paper I, astro-ph/0209191) we argue that
this is not necessarily the case, at least in a perfectly symmetrical Einstein

give a counter example to Kochanek's claims. We fit the time delay and image
positions in the quadruple image system PG1115+080. Equally good fits are found
between lens models with flat vs. Keplerian rotation curves. Time delays in
both types of models can be fit with the standard value of $H_0$. We

halos even if the data image positions are accurately given and the cosmology

observables when a small number of sources contribute effectively to the
observables. This is the case for a variety of linear functions of the spectral
energy distribution (SED) in small stellar systems, such as galactic and
extragalactic HII regions, dwarf galaxies or stellar clusters. In this paper we
show that sampling fluctuations also introduce systematic biases and
multi-modality in non-linear functions of the SED, such as luminosity ratios,
magnitudes and colours. In some cases, the distribution functions of rational
and logarithmic quantities are bimodal, hence complicating considerably the
interpretation of these quantities in terms of age or evolutionary stages.
These biases can be only assessed by Monte Carlo simulations. We find that
biases are usually negligible when the effective number of stars, Neff, which
contribute to a given observable is larger than 10. Bimodal distributions may
appear when Neff is between 10 and 0.1. Predictions from any model of stellar
population synthesis become extremely unreliable for small Neff values,
providing an operational limit to the applicability of such models for the
interpretation of integrated properties of stellar systems. In terms of stellar
masses, assuming a Salpeter Initial Mass Function in the range 0.08 -- 120 Mo,
Neff=10 corresponds to about 10**5 Mo (although the exact value depends on the
age and the observable). This bias may account, at least in part, for claimed
variations in the properties of the stellar initial mass function in small
systems, and arises from the discrete nature of small stellar populations.

At metallicities [Fe/H] <= -2.5, the elements in the mass region past barium (A

products. The identification of an environment provided by massive stars and
associated Type II supernovae as an r-process site seems compelling. Increasing
levels of heavy s-process (e.g., barium) enrichment with increasing
metallicity, evident in the abundances of more metal-rich halo stars and disk
stars, reflect the delayed contributions from the low- and intermediate-mass (M

by consecutively placing an 0.1 arcsec slit at 18 adjacent positions. Careful
and complicated data reduction and analysis were required. The spectral pixel
size exceeds the velocity dispersion of M15, which puts the project at the

effects: drifts in the STIS wavelength scale during an HST orbit; the orbital
velocity component of HST along the line-of-sight to the cluster, and its
variations during the HST orbit; and the apparent wavelength shift that is

triples the number of stars with measured velocities in the central 1 arcsec of

ground-based data we obtain the radial profiles of the projected kinematical
quantities. The RMS velocity sigma_RMS rises to 14 km/s in the central few
arcsec, somewhat higher than the values of 10-12 km/s inferred previously from
ground-based data. To interpret the results we construct dynamical models based
on the Jeans equation, which imply that M15 must have a central concentration
of non-luminous material. If this is due to a single black hole, then its mass
is M_BH = (3.9 +/- 2.2) x 10^3 solar masses. This is consistent with the
relation between M_BH and sigma_RMS that has been established for galaxies.
Also, the existence of intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters is
consistent with several scenarios for globular cluster evolution proposed in
the literature. Therefore, these results may have important implications for
our understanding of the evolution of globular clusters, the growth of black
holes, the connection between globular cluster and galaxy formation, and the
nature of the recently discovered `ultra-luminous' X-ray sources in nearby
galaxies. Instead of a single black hole, M15 could have a central
concentration of dark remnants (e.g., neutron stars) due to mass segregation.
However, the best-fitting Fokker-Planck models that have previously been
constructed for M15 do not predict a central mass concentration that is
sufficient to explain the observed kinematics.[ABRIDGED]

mass-loss rates and terminal velocities. The models are 2.5-dimensional,
include an energy balance condition with radiative heating and cooling
processes, and includes local ionization equilibrium introducing time
dependence and spatial dependence on the line radiation force parameters. The
radiation field is assumed to originate in an optically thick accretion disk.
Wind ion populations are calculated under the asumption that local ionization
equilibrium is determined by photoionization and radiative recombination,
similar to a photoionized nebula. We find a steady wind flowing from the
accretion disk. Radiative heating tends to maintain the temperature in the
higher density wind regions near the disk surface, rather than cooling
adiabatically. For a disk luminosity Ldisk = Lsun, white dwarf mass Mwd = 0.6
Msun, and white dwarf radii Rwd = 0.01 Rsun, we obtain a wind mass-loss rate of
dMwind/dt =4E-12 Msun/yr, and a terminal velocity of ~ 3000 km/s. These results
confirm the general velocity and density tructures found in our earlier
constant ionization equilibrium adiabatic CV wind models. Further we establish
here 2.5D numerical models that can be extended to QSO/AGN winds where the
local ionization equilibrium will play a crucial role in the overall dynamics.

Herbig Ae/Be stars is studied. This is done by constructing a self-consistent
model based on 2-D radiative transfer coupled to the equation of vertical
hydrostatics. As a simplifying assumption a grey opacity is used. It is found
that the disk can adopt four different structures, dependent on the surface
density distribution Sigma(R) as a function of radius, i.e. on radial- and
vertical optical depth of the disk. For the case of high to intermediate
vertical optical depth, the temperature and density structures are in agreement
with the simple ``disk with inner hole'' model of Dullemond, Dominik & Natta
(2001, henceforth DDN01). At large radii the disk adopts a flaring shape as
expected, and near the dust destruction radius (located at about 0.5 AU for
most Herbig Ae stars) the disk is superheated and puffs up. The region directly
behind this ``puffed-up inner dust wall'' is shadowed, as predicted by DDN01.
For the case of intermediate to low vertical optical depth, but still high
radial optical depth, the 2-D models show that the shadow can cover the entire
disk. The disk is then no longer flaring. When the disk is optically thin even
in radial direction, it becomes unshadowed again because the inner rim can no
longer block the stellar light. Finally, for disks that flare at intermediate
radii, but become too optically thin at large radii, the outer parts once again
become shadowed. But this time the shadowing is caused by the flaring part of
the disk instead of the inner rim. Observational consequences of these four
geometries are discussed.

refinement technique with initial conditions drawn from a flat Lambda-dominated
cold dark matter model cosmology to follow the nonequilibrium chemistry of nine
chemical species in the presence of both a soft ultraviolet Lyman-Werner H_2
photodissociating flux and a soft X-ray background extending to 7.2 keV.
Although we vary the normalization of the X-ray background by two orders of
magnitude, the positive feedback effect of the X-rays on cooling and collapse
of the pregalactic cloud expected due to the increased electron fraction is
quite mild, only weakly affecting the mass threshold for collapse and the
fraction of gas within the cloud that is able to cool. Inside most of the cloud
we find that H_2 is in photodissociation equilibrium with the soft UV flux. The
net buildup of the electron density needed to enhance H_2 formation occurs too
slowly compared to the H_2 photodissociation and dynamical timescales within
the cloud to overcome the negative impact of the soft UV photodissociating flux
on cloud collapse. However, we find that even in the most extreme cases the
first objects to form do rely on molecular hydrogen as coolant and stress that
our results do not justify the neglect of these objects in models of galaxy
formation.

M_sun. BLR mass estimates in several existing textbooks suggest lower values,
but pertain to much less luminous Seyfert galaxies or include only a small
fraction of the ionized/emitting volume of the BLR. The previous estimates also
fail to include the large amounts of BLR gas that emit at low efficiency (in a
given line), but that must be present based on reverberation and other studies.
Very highly ionized gas, as well as partially ionized and neutral gas lying
behind the ionization zones, are likely additional sources of mass within the
BLR. The high masses found here imply that the chemical enrichment of the BLR
cannot be controlled by mass ejection from one or a few stars. A significant
stellar population in the host galaxies must be contributing. Simple scaling
arguments based on normal galactic chemical enrichment and solar or higher BLR
metallicities show that the minimum mass of the enriching stellar population is
of order 10 times the BLR mass, or greater than 10^4-10^5 M_sun. More realistic
models of the chemical and dynamical evolution in galactic nuclei suggest that
much larger, bulge-size stellar populations are involved.

high spectral resolution achieved has had to be matched by unprecedented high
spatial resolution in the imaging microchannel plate detector used to record
the data. We illustrate the performance of the complete instrument through an
analysis of the 220-245A spectrum of the white dwarf G191-B2B obtained with a

likely to contain comparable number of protons and neutrons. During
acceleration process, and/or later, due to interaction with external medium,
such ejecta are likely to be split into spatially distinct shells of neutron
and proton-electron plasmas. This leads to dynamical effects which can affect
the afterglow light curves. In this paper we study these effects including, for
the first time, radiation drag imposed on the neutron rich ejecta. In the
presence of efficient radiation drag and for typical ejecta Lorentz factor
(below 400), this is the neutron shell which moves faster and, after conversion
to proton-electron plasma, powers the afterglow. After certain amount of
deceleration, this shell is hit by the second one. Such collision will lead to
reflaring, as observed in some afterglow light curves.

branching of the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) curves at around
100 K, a cusp at 85 K and a diamagnetic transition around 30 K in the ZFC part.
A further confirmation for the superconductivity at 30 K was obtained from a
resistance vs. temperature measurement. Annealing the as-synthesized sample in
100-atm O2 atmosphere at 420 oC increased the diamagnetic transition
temperature from 30 K to 43 K. According to a thermogravimetric analysis, the
oxygen content increased accordingly by ca. 0.15 oxygen atoms per formula unit.
Quantitative analysis of the XANES spectra using Sr2RuO4 (RuIV) and Sr2GdRuO6
(RuV) as reference materials revealed a valence value of +4.74 and +4.81 for Ru
in the as-synthesized and the 100-atm O2-annealed sample, respectively. The

is shown that these conflicts are not an undesirable artefact of the parallel

friction parameter $\mu$ can be interpreted as a kind of internal local
pressure between the pedestrians which becomes important in regions of high
density, ocurring e.g. in panic situations. We present simulations of the
evacuation of a large room with one door. It is found that friction has not

display a non-unique flow-density relation (fundamental diagram) for certain

conditions plays a crucial role.In contrast to all models investigated so far,
the high flow states of the Krauss-model are not metastable, but also stable.
Nevertheless we find that the current in open systems obeys an extremal
principle introduced for the case of simpler discrete models. The phase diagram
of the open system will be completely determined by the fundamental diagram of
the periodic system through this principle. In order to allow the investigation
of the whole state space of the Krauss-model, appropriate strategies for the
injection of cars into the system are needed.Two methods solving this problem
are discussed and the boundary-induced phase transitions for both methods are
studied.We also suggest a supplementary rule for the extremal principle to
account for cases where not all the possible bulk states are generated by the
chosen boundary conditions.

model used, comprising the twofold conduction band and the fourfold topmost
valence band (or heavy- and light-hole states), incorporates spin-splitting of
the single-particle states. The interaction terms include besides the direct
Coulomb coupling between carriers also the electron-hole exchange interaction,
which together with the spin-splitting terms is responsible for spin
relaxation. Applying the Hartree-Fock truncation scheme leads to a set of
coherent semiconductor Bloch equations for the multiband case. This concept
provides the theoretical frame for describing phenomena connected with optical
response under excitation with arbitrary light polarization and spin
relaxation: polarized optical response, polarization dynamics of VCSELs, spin
relaxation, and the circular photovoltaic effect.

collected by recent e+e- and fixed target experiments. Sensitivities to
D0-D0bar mixing and CP violation are approaching some non-standard model
predictions. Recent measurements of charmed particle lifetimes and semileptonic
decays have added to our understanding of decay mechanisms and the dynamics of
heavy-to-light quark transitions. Many of these provide vital input to QCD
models and are an essential ingredient in extracting standard model parameters
from other measurements. Studies of charmonium production continue to offer new
surprises. A recent measurement from Belle indicates that ~60% of J/psi events
produced in continuum e+e- collisions are produced with an additional charm
quark pair. Fueled by new data from a host of continuing and future
experiments, we can expect significant improvement to the standard model and

dual theory is shown to describe a three-dimensional gas of point charges with
logarithmic interactions which arises from an anomalous dimension of the gauge
field caused by critical matter field fluctuations. The theory is equivalent to
a sine-Gordon-like theory in 2+1 dimensions with an anomalous gradient energy
proportional to $k^3$. The Callan-Symanzik equation is used to demonstrate that
this theory has a massless and a massive phase. The renormalization group
equations for the fugacity $y(l)$ and stiffness parameter $K(l)$ of the theory
show that the renormalization of $K(l)$ induces an anomalous scaling dimension
$\eta_y$ of $y(l)$. The stiffness parameter of the theory has a universal jump
at the transition determined by the dimensionality and $\eta_y$. As a byproduct
of our analysis, we relate the critical coupling of the sine-Gordon-like theory
to an {\it a priori} arbitrary constant that enters into the computation of
critical exponents in the Abelian Higgs model at the charged infrared-stable
fixed point of the theory, enabling a determination of this parameter. This
facilitates the computation of the critical exponent $\nu$ at the charged fixed
point in excellent agreement with one-loop renormalization group calculations
for the three-dimensional XY-model, thus confirming expectations based on
duality transformations.

depends only on the geometry, not on the microscopic models of inflation and
stabilization. D(D-3)/2 degrees of freedom of the free bulk gravitons are
projected onto the 3d brane as tensor, vector and scalar modes. We found the
following no-go results for a generic geometry of a five (or D) dimensional
warped metric with four dimensional de Sitter (inflationary) slices and two (or
one) edge of the world branes: Massive KK graviton modes are not generated from
inflation (with the Hubble parameter H) due to the gap in the KK spectrum; the
universal lower bound on the gap is sqrt{3/2} H. Massless scalar and vector
projections of the bulk gravitons are absent, unlike in geometries with KK
compactification.
  A massless 4d tensor mode is generated from inflation with the amplitude
H/M_P, where M_P is the effective Planck mass during inflation, derived from
the D dimensional fundamental mass M_S and the volume of the inner dimensions.
However, M_P for a curved dS braneworld may differ from that of the flat brane
at low energies, either due to the H-dependence of the inner space volume or
variations in the brane separation before stabilization. Thus the amplitude of
gravitational waves from inflation in braneworld cosmology may be different
from that predicted by inflation in 4d theory.
