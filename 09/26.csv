the Universe was already lit up by bright quasars fuelled by the infall of gas
onto supermassive black holes. The masses of these early black holes are
inferred from their luminosities to be > 10^9 solar masses, which is a
difficult theoretical challenge to explain. Like nearby quasars, the early
objects could have formed in the central cores of massive host galaxies. The
formation of these hosts could be explained if, like local large galaxies, they
were assembled gravitationally inside massive (> 10^12 solar mass) halos of
dark matter. There has hitherto been no observational evidence for the presence
of these massive hosts or their surrounding halos. Here we show that the cosmic
gas surrounding each halo must respond to its strong gravitational pull, where
absorption by the infalling hydrogen produces a distinct spectral signature.
That signature can be seen in recent data.

extending over 3 pc, is spatially and kinematically complex on sub-parsec
scales, suggesting the presence of small, dense gas clouds with a wide range of
velocities and column densities. The main absorption component matches that
detected in the MERLIN study and is consistent with absorption through a clumpy
neutral gas layer in the putative obscuring torus, with higher velocity blue-
and red-shifted systems with narrow linewidths also detected across E+F. The
spatial location and distribution of the absorbing gas across component E+F
rules out component E as the location of the AGN (as suggested by Ulvestad et

the mean magnetic flux to mass ratio in the interstellar medium. When ions are
strongly coupled to neutrals, the transport of a large--scale magnetic field is
driven by both turbulent mixing and nonlinear, ambipolar drift. Using a
standard homogeneous and Gaussian statistical model for turbulence, we show
rigorously that a large-scale magnetic field can decay on at most turbulent
mixing time scales when the field and neutral flow are strongly coupled. There
is no enhancement of the decay rate by ambipolar diffusion. These results

  All three spectra show strong, narrow emission lines with the asymmetric
profile that is characteristically produced in high redshift Lyman alpha
emitters by preferential HI absorption in the blue wing of the line. These
objects are undetected in deep Bw, V, R, and 6600A narrow-band images from the
NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey and from LALA, as expected from Lyman break and
Lyman alpha forest absorption at redshift z = 5.7. All three objects show large
equivalent widths (>= 150A in the rest-frame), suggesting at least one of the
following: a top-heavy initial mass function, very low stellar metallicity, or
the presence of an active nucleus. We consider the case for an active nucleus
to be weak in all three objects due to the limited width of the Lyman alpha
emission line (< 500 km/s) and the absence of any other indicator of quasar
activity.
  The three confirmed high redshift objects were among four spectroscopically
observed targets drawn from the sample of 18 candidates presented by Rhoads and
Malhotra (2001). Thus, these spectra support the Lyman alpha emitter population
statistics from our earlier photometric study, which imply little evolution in
number density from z=5.7 to z=4.5 and provide strong evidence that the

simulations. In this regime accreting matter tends to be expelled from the
equatorial region of the magnetosphere where the centrifugal force on matter
rotating with the star exceeds the gravitational force. The regime is predicted
to occur if the magnetospheric radius larger than the corotation radius and
less than the light cylinder radius. The simulations show that accreting
matters is expelled from the equatorial region of the magnetosphere and that it
moves away from the star in a supersonic, disk-shaped outflow. At larger radial
distances the outflow slows down and becomes subsonic. The equatorial matter
outflow is initially driven by the centrifugal force, but at larger distances
the pressure gradient becomes significant. We find that the star is spun-down
mainly by the magnetic torques at its surface with the rate of loss of angular
momentum $\dot{L}$ proportional to $-\Omega_*^{1.3}\mu^{0.8}$, where $\Omega_*$
is the star's rotation rate and $\mu$ is its magnetic moment. Further, we find
that $\dot{L}$ is approximately independent of the magnetic diffusivity of the

with the latest data about a rather large relative number of such clusters
among globulars in M33 and their low portion in M31, seems to be consistent
with the suspected process. It might have taken place within the system of the
most massive galaxies of the Local Group (LG) at the earliest stages of their
formation and evolution. We argue that the origin and basic characteristics of
the SPGCs can naturally be explained as a result of mass outflow from M31,
during and due to formation of its Pop. II stars, and subsequent accretion of
gas onto its massive companions, the Galaxy and M33. An amount of the gas
accreted onto the Milky Way is expected to have been quite enough for the
formation in the outer Galactic halo not only of the clusters under
consideration but also a number of those dSph galaxies which are as young as
the SPGCs. A less significant, but notable mass transfer from the starbursting
protoGalaxy to the massive members of the LG might have occurred, too.

model calculations of PDF peak widths and the experimentally determined peak
widths. The Debye model successfully explains the average, though not detailed,

diffusion in lattice gases. We consider both models in which the gas particles
density is explicitly conserved and situations in which the lattice gas
particles undergo continuous exchanges with a reservoir, which case is
appropriate, e.g., to adsorbed monolayers in contact with the vapor phase. For
all these models we determine, in some cases exactly and in other ones - using
a certain decoupling approximation, the mean displacement of a tracer particle
(TP) driven by a constant external force in a dynamical background formed by
the lattice gas particles whose transition rates are symmetric. Evaluating the
TP mean displacement explicitly we are able to define the TP mobility, which
allows us to demonstrate that the Einstein relation between the TP mobility and
the diffusivity generally holds, despite the fact that in some cases diffusion
is anomalous. For models treated within the framework of the decoupling
approximation, our analytical results are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.
Perturbance of the lattice gas particles distribution due to the presence of a
biased TP and the form of the particle density profiles are also discussed.

thrive is limited from above due to genomic information deterioration, and from
below by insufficient sequence diversity, which leads to a quick eradication of
the virus by the immune system. The mutation rate that optimally balances these
two requirements depends to first order on the ratio of the inverse of the
virus' growth rate and the time the immune system needs to develop a specific
answer to an antigen. We find that a virus is most viable if it generates
exactly one mutation within the time it takes for the immune system to adapt to
a new viral epitope. Experimental viral mutation rates, in particular for HIV

that can be mapped onto the ""row model"" for partially frustrated triangular
magnets. We present heat capacity measurements that reveal a phase transition
at T_N = 1.18K, indicative of magnetic ordering. The zero-field magnetically
ordered structure was solved from neutron powder diffraction data taken between
0.04 and 1.2 K. It consists of an incommensurate spiral with a temperature
independent propagation vector Q=(2Q 0 0)=(+/-0.622 0 0), where different signs
relate to the two different networks. This corresponds to (+/-0.311 +/-0.311 0)

of the full Mn2+ moment. From the values of T_N and Q, the exchange parameters
J/k = 0.15 K and J'/J = 0.749 are estimated. The magnetic-field dependence of
the intensity of the <2Q 0 0> Bragg reflection, measured for external fields
H||Q, indicates the presence of three different magnetic phases. We associate
them with the incommensurate spiral (H < 13.5 kOe), an intermediate phase (13.5
kOe < H < 16 kOe), and the ""2-1"" spin-flop like magnetic structure (H > 16 kOe)
proposed for related compounds. For increasing fields, Q continuously
approaches the value 1/3, corresponding to the commensurate magnetic structure
of the fully frustrated triangular lattice. This value is reached at H_c = 19
kOe. At this point, the field-dependence reverses and Q adopts a value of 0.327
at 26 kOe, the highest field applied in the experiment. Except for H_c, the
magnetic ordering is incommensurate in all three magnetic phases of
Mn[C(CN)3]2.

methods inspired by equilibrium statistical physics, such as {\em simulated

complete understanding of the proposed duality. We argue that the limit of no

this CFT loop contribution to the gauge field 1PI two-point function is dual
(on the RS side) to the full gauge propagator (i.e., including the contribution
of Kaluza-Klein and zero-modes) with both external points on the Planck brane.
We also emphasize that loop corrections to the gauge coupling on the RS side
are dual to sub-leading effects in a large-N expansion on the CFT side; these
sub-leading corrections to the gauge coupling in the dual CFT are (in general)
sensitive to the strong dynamics of the CFT.

produce stable solitons of lower dimensionality. Solitons that localize
massless gauge fields in their world volume automatically imply the existence
of open flux tubes ending on them and closed flux tubes propagating in the
bulk. We discuss some aspects of this localization on explicit examples of
unstable wall-anti-wall systems. The annihilation of these walls can be
described in terms of tachyon condensation which renders the world-volume gauge
field non-dynamical. During this condensation the world volume gauge fields
(open string states) are resonantly excited. These can later decay into closed
strings, or get squeezed into a network flux tubes similar to a network of
cosmic strings formed at a cosmological phase transition. Although, as in the
$D$-brane case, perturbatively one can find exact time-dependent solutions,
when the energy of the system stays localized in the plane of the original
soliton, such solutions are unstable with respect to decay into open and closed
string states. Thus, when a pair of such walls annihilates, the energy is
carried away (at least) by closed string excitations (``glueballs''), which are
the lowest energy excitations about the bulk vacuum. Suggested analogies can be
useful for the understanding of the complicated D-brane dynamics and of the
production of topological defects and reheating during brane collision in the

due to the non-vanishing coupling to the rolling open string tachyon with
co-dimensions larger than 2, and discuss the effect of back reaction to the

tachyonic matter remains in the late time, but it will completely evaporate
away over a short time of few string scales if the string coupling is huge.

over a standard positively graded commutative Noetherian ring $R$, with respect
to the irrelevant ideal $R_+$, is itself graded; all its graded components are
finitely generated modules over $R_0$, the component of $R$ of degree 0. This
paper is concerned with the asymptotic behaviour of
$\Ass_{R_0}(H^i_{R_+}(M)_n)$ as $n \to -\infty$.
  The smallest $i$ for which such study is interesting is the finiteness
dimension $f$ of $M$ relative to $R_+$, defined as the least integer $j$ for
which $H^j_{R_+}(M)$ is not finitely generated. Brodmann and Hellus have shown
that $\Ass_{R_0}(H^f_{R_+}(M)_n)$ is constant for all $n < < 0$ (that is, in
their terminology, $\Ass_{R_0}(H^f_{R_+}(M)_n)$ is asymptotically stable for $n
\to -\infty$). The first main aim of this paper is to identify the ultimate
constant value (under the mild assumption that $R$ is a homomorphic image of a
regular ring): our answer is precisely the set of contractions to $R_0$ of
certain relevant primes of $R$ whose existence is confirmed by Grothendieck's
Finiteness Theorem for local cohomology.
  Brodmann and Hellus raised various questions about such asymptotic behaviour
when $i > f$. They noted that Singh's study of a particular example (in which
$f = 2$) shows that $\Ass_{R_0}(H^3_{R_+}(R)_n)$ need not be asymptotically
stable for $n \to -\infty$. The second main aim of this paper is to determine,
for Singh's example, $\Ass_{R_0}(H^3_{R_+}(R)_n)$ quite precisely for every
integer $n$, and, thereby, answer one of the questions raised by Brodmann and
Hellus.

Yang-Mills field can be gauge transformed to a smooth field if the $L^2$ norm

first is Price's monotonicity formula, which allows us to assert that the
curvature is small not only in the $L^2$ norm, but also in the Morrey norm
$M_2^{n/2}$. The second ingredient is a new inductive (averaged radial) gauge
construction and truncation argument which allows us to approximate a singular
gauge as a weak limit of smooth gauges with curvature small in the Morrey norm.
The second ingredient is variant of Uhlenbeck's lemma, allowing one to place a
smooth connection into the Coulomb gauge whenever the Morrey norm of the
curvature is small; This variant was also proved independently by Meyer and
Riviere. It follows easily from this variant that a $W^{1,2}$-connection can be
placed in the Coulomb gauge if it can be approximated by smooth connections
whose curvatures have small Morrey norm.

structure comprise the transformation of the Schr{\""o}dinger equation for

the equivalent density and energy are obtained. By employing the integrated
form of the Kato electron-nucleus cusp condition, we prove that the effective
electron -interaction potential energy of these model fermions or bosons is
finite at a nucleus. The proof is general and valid for arbitrary system
whether it be atomic, molecular, or solid state, and for arbitrary state and
symmetry. This then provides justification for all prior work in the literature
based on the assumption of finiteness of this potential energy at a nucleus. We
further demonstrate the criticality of the electron-nucleus cusp condition to
such theories by example of the Hydrogen molecule. We show thereby that both
model system effective electron-interaction potential energies, as determined
from densities derived from accurate wave functions, will be singular at the
nucleus unless the wave function satisfies the electron-nucleus cusp condition.
