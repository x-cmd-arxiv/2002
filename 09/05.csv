spectroscopy and imaging of the metal-rich nuclear starburst in NGC3049. The
stellar continuum and the absorption line spectrum in the ultraviolet are used
to constrain the massive stellar population. The strong, blueshifted stellar
lines of CIV and SiIV detected in the UV spectra indicate a metal-rich,
compact, massive (1E6 Msol) cluster of age 3--4 Myr emitting the UV-optical
continuum. We find strong evidence against a depletion of massive stars in this
metal-rich cluster. The derived age and the upper mass-limit cut-off of the
initial mass function are also consistent with the detection of Wolf-Rayet (WR)
features at optical wavelengths. As a second independentconstraint on the
massive stellar content, the nebular emission-line spectrum is modeled with
photoionization codes using stellar spectra from evolutionary synthesis models.
However, the nebular lines are badly reproduced by 3--4 Myr instantaneous
bursts, as required by the UV line spectrum, when unblanketed WR and/or Kurucz
stellar atmospheres are used. The corresponding number of photons above 24 and
54 eV in the synthetic models is too high in comparison with values suggested
by the observed line ratios. Since the ionizing spectrum in this regime is
dominated by emission from WR stars, this discrepancy between observations and
models is most likely the result of incorrect assumptions about the WR stars.
Thus we conclude that the nebular spectrum of high-metallicity starbursts is
poorly reproduced by models for WR dominated populations. However, the new
model set of Smith et al. (2002) with blanketed WR and O atmospheres and
adjusted WR temperatures predicts a softer far-UV radiation field, providing a
better match to the data.

electromagnetic energy is distributed throughout the entire region extending
from the horizon of the EMBH to infinity. We discuss two conceptually different
mechanisms of energy extraction occurring respectively in an EMBH with
electromagnetic fields smaller and larger than the critical field for vacuum
polarization. For a subcritical EMBH the energy extraction mechanism involves a
sequence of discrete elementary processes implying the decay of a particle into
two oppositely charged particles. For a supercritical EMBH an alternative
mechanism is at work involving an electron-positron plasma created by vacuum
polarization. The energetics of these mechanisms as well as the definition of
the spatial regions in which thay can occur are given. The physical
implementations of these ideas are outlined for ultrahigh energy cosmic rays

gamma-ray burst classes; Class I (long, large fluence bursts of intermediate
spectral hardness), Class II (short, small fluence, hard bursts), and Class III
(soft bursts of intermediate durations and fluences). The algorithms
surprisingly assign larger membership to Class III than to either of the other
two classes. A known systematic bias has been previously used to explain the
existence of Class III in terms of Class I; this bias allows the fluences and
durations of some bursts to be underestimated (Hakkila et al., ApJ 538, 165,
2000). We show that this bias primarily affects only the longest bursts and
cannot explain the bulk of the Class III properties. We resolve the question of
Class III existence by demonstrating how samples obtained using standard
trigger mechanisms fail to preserve the duration characteristics of small peak
flux bursts. Sample incompleteness is thus primarily responsible for the
existence of Class III. In order to avoid this incompleteness, we show how a
new dual timescale peak flux can be defined in terms of peak flux and fluence.
The dual timescale peak flux preserves the duration distribution of faint
bursts and correlates better with spectral hardness (and presumably redshift)
than either peak flux or fluence. The techniques presented here are generic and
have applicability to the studies of other transient events. The results also
indicate that pattern recognition algorithms are sensitive to sample
completeness; this can influence the study of large astronomical databases such

synthesized from model flares that are distributed in energy according to a
power law with selectable index alpha (dN/dE ~ E^{-alpha}). Two methods are
applied, the first comparing flux distributions of the binned data, and the
second using the distributions of photon arrival time differences in the
unbinned data. We find acceptable alpha values between 2.0-2.5 for the EUVE DS

shallower energy distribution than the LECS data, which is attributed to the
harder range of sensitivity of the MECS detector and the increasing peak
temperatures of flares with increasing total (radiative) energy. The results
suggest that flares can play an important role in the energy release of this

seek the extrasolar planet signal, and describe a mathematical approach to
completely eliminate stray light from the host star (although not its Poisson
noise). For the case where the PSF is dominated by diffraction and scattering
effects, and comprises a multitude of speckles within an Airy pattern typical

showing an idealized simulation that results in a 20-sigma detection of a

discovered; the protostars are confirmed through the detection of their
accompanying outflows in CO(2-1) emission. The survey is believed to be
complete for Class 0 and Class I protostars, and yields two important results
regarding the lifetimes of these phases. First, the ratio of Class 0 to Class
protostars in the sample is roughly unity, very different from the 1:10 ratio
that has previously been observed for the rho Ophiuchi star-forming region.
Assuming star formation to be a homogeneous process in the dark clouds, this
implies that the Class 0 lifetime is similar to the Class I phase, which from
infrared surveys has been established to be approximately 200,000 yr. It also
suggests there is no rapid initial accretion phase in Class 0 objects. A burst
of triggered star formation some 100,000 yr ago can explain the earlier results
for rho Ophiuchus. Second, the number of starless cores is approximately twice
that of the total number of protostars, indicating a starless core lifetime of
approximately 800,000 yr. These starless cores are therefore very short-lived,
surviving only two or three free-fall times. This result suggests that, on size
scales of 10,000 AU at least, the dynamical evolution of starless cores is
probably not controlled by magnetic processes.

being from the interaction region between Alpha Tau's massive, cool wind and
the interstellar medium, i.e., Alpha Tau's ""astrosphere"". We compute
hydrodynamic models of the Alpha Tau astrosphere in order to see if the models
can reproduce the Mg II absorption feature. These models do predict that
stellar wind material heated, decelerated, and compressed after passing through
a termination shock a few thousand AU from the star should produce a Mg II
absorption feature with about the right width at roughly the right velocity.
However, our first models underestimate the Mg II column density by an order of

emitters. However, a significant fraction of the TeV gamma rays emitted are
likely to be absorbed in interactions with the diffuse IR background, yielding
electron-positron pairs. Hence, the observed TeV spectrum must be steeper than
the intrinsic one. Using the recently derived intrinsic $\gamma$-ray spectrum
of Mrk 501 during its 1997 high state, we study the inverse-Compton scattering
of cosmic microwave photons by the resulting electron-positron pairs, which
implies the existence of a hitherto undiscovered GeV emission. The typical
duration of the GeV emission is determined by the flaring activity time and the
energy-dependent magnetic deflection time. We numerically calculate the
scattered photon spectrum for different intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF)
strengths, and find a spectral turnover and flare duration at GeV energies
which are dependent on the field strength. We also estimate the scattered
photon flux in the quiescent state of Mrk 501. The GeV flux levels predicted
are consistent with existing EGRET upper limits, and should be detectable above
the synchrotron -- self Compton (SSC) component with the {\em Gamma-Ray Large

influenced by gravitational lensing by the foreground cluster, and therefore
conclude that this object is more likely to be an S0-like galaxy, rather than a

of such a galaxy with an apparently relaxed disk of stars at this high redshift

radio galaxies are the parent population of BL Lac objects. Based on our
observations of the B2 sample, we use Monte Carlo techniques to simulate
samples of beamed radio galaxies, and use the selection criteria of existing
samples of BL Lac objects to compare our simulated results to what is observed.
We find that previous analytical results are not applicable since the BL Lac
samples are selected on beamed flux density. A simple model in which BL Lacs
are the moderately beamed (gamma ~ 3) counterparts of radio galaxies, with some
random dispersion (~ 0.4 decades) in the intrinsic radio-X-ray relationship,
can reproduce many of the features of the radio-selected and X-ray-selected BL
Lac samples, including their radio and X-ray luminosity functions and the
distributions of their radio-to-X-ray spectral indices. In contrast, models in
which the X-ray and radio emission have systematically different beaming
parameters cannot reproduce important features of the radio-galaxy and BL Lac
populations. The redshift distribution and number counts of the X-ray-selected
EMSS sample are well reproduced by our best models, supporting a picture in
which these objects are beamed FRI radio galaxies with intrinsic luminosities
similar to those of the B2 sample. However, we cannot match the redshift
distribution of the radio-selected 1-Jy sample, and it is likely that a
population of FRII radio galaxies is responsible for the high-redshift objects

systems in detail, and review the results of a photometric variability survey

and suggest that an accretion disk is involved in jet production in CH Cyg as
well as in the outbursts of both CH Cyg and Z And. They also support the notion
that the fundamental power source in most SS is nuclear burning on the surface

carry the crystal-spin angular momentum $hbar$ and generate in a new way
constraining forces that constrain the electrons to form Cooper pairs. The

constructed from a subset n of the assets from a benchmark, consisting of N
assets whose returns are multivariate normal, is completely characterized by
its tracking error. However, if the benchmark asset returns are not
multivariate normal then higher moments of the probability distribution for the
portfolio's relative return are not related to its tracking error. We discuss
the convergence of generalized tracking error measures as the size of the
subset of benchmark assets increases. Assuming that the joint probability
distribution for the returns of the assets is symmetric under their
permutations we show that increasing n makes these generalized tracking errors
small (even though n<<N). For n>>1 the probability distribution for the
portfolio's relative return is approximately symmetric and strongly peaked
about the origin. The results of this paper generalize the conclusions of
Dynkin et. al. (2002) to more general underlying asset distributions.

screening of the long-range Coulomb interaction, and provides a source of
dissipation due to the gapless diffusive electrons. The interplay of these two
effects leads to interesting physical phenomena which are analysed in detail in
this paper. We argue that the generic superconductor-insulator transition of
charged particles in the presence of the ground plane may be controlled by a
{\it fixed line} with variable critical exponents. This is illustrated by an
explicit calculation in an appropriate $\epsilon$ expansion. In contrast, the
universal properties of the superconductor-Mott insulator transition in the
clean limit at commensurate densities are shown to be unmodified by either the
metal or the long-range Coulomb interaction. A similar fixed line can arise in
the presence of a metallic ground plane for quantum Hall plateau transitions.
Implications for experiments on Josephson-junction arrays and quantum Hall

distributions of values. The transformed Hamiltonian is ordered, and may be
interpreted as an itinerant electron interacting with a spin on each site. In
this new basis, the distinction between extended and localized states is clear,
and edges of the bands of extended states, the mobility edges, are calculated
as a function of disorder. In two dimensions these edges have been found in
both analytic and numerical applications of tridiagonalization, but they have
not been found in analytic approaches based on perturbation theory, or the
single-parameter scaling hypothesis; nor have they been detected in numerical
approaches based on scaling or critical distributions of level spacing. In both
two and three dimensions the mobility edges in this work are found to separate
with increasing disorder for all disorders, in contrast with the results of
calculation using numerical scaling for three dimensions. The analytic
trajectories are compared with recent results of numerical tridiagonalization
on samples of over 10^9 sites. This representation of the Anderson model as an
ordered interacting system implies that in addition to transitions at mobility
edges, the Anderson model contains weaker transitions characterized by critical
disorders where the band of extended states decouples from individual sites;
and that singularities in the distribution of site energies, rather than its
second moment, determine localization properties of the Anderson model.

performed analytically using an approximation that employs only a subset of
states in the functional neighborhood surrounding the most probable states.
Such integration establishes the free energy of the system, and upon taking the
derivatives of the free energy, the localization transition is shown to be
continuous and to be distinct from peak stress. When the bulk modulus of the
grain material is large, localization always occurs in the softening regime
following peak stress, while for sufficiently small bulk moduli and at
sufficiently low confining pressure, the localization occurs in the hardening
regime prior to peak stress.
  In the approach to localization, the stress-strain relation for the whole
rock remains analytic, as is observed both in experimental data and in simpler
models.
  The correlation function of the crack fields is also obtained. It has a
correlation length characterizing the aspect ratio of the crack clusters that

chain models are not able to describe the Monte Carlo data in a thermodynamic
consistent way. This study reinforces the use of the wormlike chain model to
interpret experimental data on the elasticity of synthetic polymers in the
finite extensibility regime, provided the chain is not yet in its fully
stretched regime. Specific solvent effects on the elasticity law and the
partition between energetic and entropic contributions to single chain
elasticity are investigated.

solid accumulates damage is applied to the special case of fiber bundles with
global load sharing and is shown to be exact in this case. The theory
postulates that the probability of observing a given emergent damage state is
obtained by maximizing the emergent entropy as defined by Shannon subject to
energetic constraints. This theory yields the known exact results for the
fiber-bundle model with global load sharing and holds for any quenched-disorder
distribution. It further defines how the entropy evolves as a function of
stress, and shows definitively how the concepts of temperature and entropy
emerge in a problem where all statistics derive from the initial quenched
disorder.
  A previously unnoticed phase transition is shown to exist as the entropy goes
through a maximum. In general, this entropy-maximum transition occurs at a
different point in strain history than the stress-maximum transition with the
precise location depending entirely on the quenched-disorder distribution.

attractive theory of the semantics of natural language questions, commonly
referred to as the partition theory. Two central notions in this theory are
entailment between questions and answerhood. For example, the question ""Who is
going to the party?"" entails the question ""Is John going to the party?"", and
""John is going to the party"" counts as an answer to both. Groenendijk and
Stokhof define these two notions in terms of partitions of a set of possible
worlds.
  We provide a syntactic characterization of entailment between questions and
answerhood . We show that answers are, in some sense, exactly those formulas
that are built up from instances of the question. This result lets us compare
the partition theory with other approaches to interrogation -- both linguistic
analyses, such as Hamblin's and Karttunen's semantics, and computational
systems, such as Prolog. Our comparison separates a notion of answerhood into
three aspects: equivalence (when two questions or answers are interchangeable),
atomic answers (what instances of a question count as answers), and compound
answers (how answers compose).

Relaxation of these assumptions permits sensible theories of quantum gravity

theta12 offers a way to probe otherwise inaccessible features of supernova

whereby string scale unification is facilitated via exotic matter with
intermediate scale mass. This mechanism guarantees that a virtual MSSM
unification below the string scale is extrapolated from the running of gauge
couplings upward from M_Z^o when an intermediate scale desert is assumed. In
this letter we explore the possibility of optical unification within the
context of weakly coupled heterotic strings. In particular, we investigate this
for models of free fermionic construction containing the NAHE set of basis
vectors. This class is of particular interest for optical unification, because
it provides a standard hypercharge embedding within SO(10), giving the standard
k_Y = 5/3 hypercharge level, which was shown necessary for optical unification.
We present a NAHE model for which the set of exotic SU(3)_C
triplet/anti-triplet pairs, SU(2)_L doublets, and non-Abelian singlets with
hypercharge offers the possibility of optical unification. Whether this model
can realize optical unification is conditional upon these exotics not receiving
Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) scale masses when a flat direction of scalar vacuum
expectation values is non-perturbatively chosen to cancel the FI D-term, xi,
generated by the anomalous U(1)-breaking Green-Schwarz-Dine-Seiberg-Wittten
mechanism. A study of perturbative flat directions and their phenomenological

peaked around some non-zero value of $<\phi(0)>$, and characterized by a single
particle Bose-Einstein distribution function at a given temperature. We compute
the evolution of the system using three different approximations: Hartree, BVA
and a related 2PI-1/N expansion, as a function of coupling strength and initial
temperature. In the Hartree approximation, the static phase diagram shows that
there is a first order phase transition for this system. As we change the
initial starting temperature of the system, we find that the BVA relaxes to a
new final temperature and exhibits a second order phase transition. We find
that the average fields thermalize for arbitrary initial conditions in the BVA,
unlike the behavior exhibited by the Hartree approximation, and we illustrate
how $<\phi(t)>$ and $<\chi(t)>$ depend on the initial temperature and on the
coupling constant. We find that the 2PI-1/N expansion gives dramatically
different results for $<\phi(t)>$.

transition in quantum mechanics, can be recast in the closed time-path
formalism. This results in simpler, explicit expressions than were obtained in
the Schr\""odinger formulation and allows for a straightforward generalization
to higher dimensions. Motivated by the success of the method in the
quantum-mechanical problem, where it has been shown to give more accurate
results for longer than existing alternatives, we apply the linear delta
expansion to four-dimensional field theory.
  At small times all methods agree. At later times, the first-order linear
delta expansion is consistently higher that Hartree-Fock, but does not show any
sign of a turnover. A turnover emerges in second-order of the method, but the
value of $<\hat{\Phi}^2(t)>$ at the turnover is larger that that given by the
Hartree-Fock approximation. Based on this calculation, and our experience in
the corresponding quantum-mechanical problem, we believe that the Hartree-Fock
approximation does indeed underestimate the value of $<\hat{\Phi}^2(t)>$ at the
turnover. In subsequent applications of the method we hope to implement the
calculation in the context of an expanding universe, following the line of
earlier calculations by Boyanovsky {\sl et al.}, who used the Hartree-Fock and
large-N methods. It seems clear, however, that the method will become
unreliable as the system enters the reheating stage.

Lett. 90 (2003) 230602","10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.230602",,"quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech nlin.CD",,"  We show that particle transport in a uniform, quantum multi-baker map, is
generically ballistic in the long time limit, for any fixed value of Planck's
constant. However, for fixed times, the semi-classical limit leads to
diffusion. Random matrix theory provides explicit analytical predictions for
the mean square displacement of a particle in the system. These results exhibit
a crossover from diffusive to ballistic motion, with crossover time from
diffusive to ballistic motion on the order of the inverse of Planck's constant.
We can argue, that for a large class of 1D quantum random walks, similar to the
quantum multi-baker, a sufficient condition for diffusion in the semi-classical
limit is classically chaotic dynamics in each cell. Using an initial
equilibrium density matrix, we find that diffusive behavior is recovered in the
semi-classical limit for such systems, without further interactions with the
environment.

in some exactly solvable models in which the decoherence is caused by a pure
dephasing process. In particular, for the toy models presented in this paper,
we identify two different time scales, one is responsible for local dephasing,
while the other is for entanglement decay. For a class of fragile entangled
states defined in this paper, we find that the entanglement of two qubits, as
measured by concurrence, decays faster asymptotically than the quantum
dephasing of an individual qubit.

pair of qubits and allowing asymptotically secure key distribution and
quasi-secure direct communication. Since the information is transferred in a
deterministic manner, no qubits have to be discarded. The transmission of
information is instantaneous, i.e. the information can be decoded during the
transmission. The security against arbitrary eavesdropping attacks is provided.
In case of eavesdropping attacks with full information gain, the detection rate
is 50% per control transmission. The experimental realization of the protocol
is feasible with relatively small effort, which also makes commercial
applications conceivable.

affected by spectral filtering, crystal thickness, and, most importantly, the
choice of pump source. It is also robust against environmental disturbance and
a more general state, partially mixed$-$partially entangled state, can be
readily generated as well.
