and hyperactive stars and samples the bulk part of activity levels encountered
in coronal X-ray sources. We use the LETGS spectra to carry out density and
temperature diagnostics with an emphasis on the H-like and the He-like ions. We
find a correlation between line flux ratios of the Lyman-Alpha and He-like
resonance lines with the mean X-ray surface flux. We determine densities using
the He-like triplets. For active stars we find no significant deviations from
the low-density limit for the ions of Ne, Mg, and Si, while the measured line
ratios for the ions of C, N, and O do show evidence for departures from the
low-density limit in the active stars, but not in the inactive stars. Best
measurements can be made for the OVII triplet where we find significant
deviations from the low-density limit for the stars Algol, Procyon, YY Gem, Eps
Eri, and HR1099. We discuss the influence of radiation fields on the
interpretation of the He-like triplet line ratios in the low-Z ions, which is
relevant for Algol, and the influence of dielectronic satellite lines, which is
relevant for Procyon. For the active stars YY Gem, Eps Eri, and HR1099 the low
f/i ratios can unambiguously be attributed to high densties in the range 1--3

have allowed an assessment of the evolution of the space density of clusters
out to z~1, and the evolution of the physical properties of the intra-cluster
medium out to z~0.5. With the advent of Chandra and Newton-XMM, and their
unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution, these studies have been
extended beyond redshift unity and have revealed the complexity of the
thermodynamical structure of clusters. The properties of the intra-cluster gas
are significantly affected by non-gravitational processes including star
formation and Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity. Convincing evidence has
emerged for modest evolution of both the bulk of the X-ray cluster population
and their thermodynamical properties since redshift unity. Such an
observational scenario is consistent with hierarchical models of structure
formation in a flat low density universe with Omega_m=0.3 and sigma_8=0.7-0.8
for the normalization of the power spectrum. Basic methodologies for
construction of X-ray-selected cluster samples are reviewed and implications of
cluster evolution for cosmological models are discussed.

The Astrophysical Journal, in press","Astrophys.J. 580 (2002) 969-979","10.1086/343859",,"astro-ph",,"  (Abridged) We consider the expansion of an initially self-gravitating,
static, singular, isothermal cloud core. For t>0, the gas is ionized and heated
to a higher uniform temperature by the formation of a luminous, but massless,
star in its center. The approximation that the mass and gravity of the central
star is negligible for the subsequent motion of the HII region holds for
distances much greater than about 100 AU and for the massive cloud cores that
give rise to high-mass stars. If the initial ionization and heating is
approximated to occur instantaneously at t=0, then the subsequent flow (for r
>> 100 AU) caused by the resulting imbalance between self-gravity and thermal
pressure is self-similar. Because of the steep density profile, pressure
gradients produce a shock front that travels into the cloud, accelerating the
gas to supersonic velocities in what has been called the ``champagne phase.''
We then study the self-similar solutions of the expansion of HII regions
embedded in molecular clouds characterized by more general power-law density
distributions with exponent 3/2 < n < 3. In these cases, the shock velocity is
an increasing function of the exponent n, and diverges as n tends to 3. We show
that this happens because the model includes an origin, where the pressure
driving the shock diverges because the enclosed heated mass is infinite. Our
results imply that the continued photoevaporation of massive reservoirs of
neutral gas (e.g., surrounding disks and/or globules) nearby to the embedded
ionizing source is required in order to maintain over a significant timescale
the emission measure observed in champagne flows.

and physical parameters and their influence on the age estimated by means of

sequence have been obtained on the base of progenitor evolutionary tracks
computed starting from the zero age horizontal branch and for a typical halo
chemical composition (Z=0.0001, Y=0.23). The uncertainties due to nuclear
reaction rates, convection, mass loss and initial chemical composition are
discussed. Then, various cooling sequences for a typical white dwarf mass
(M=0.6 Mo) have been calculated under different assumptions on some input
physics, namely: conductive opacity, contribution of the ion-electron
interaction to the free energy and microscopic diffusion. Finally we present
the evolution of white dwarfs having mass ranging between 0.5 and 0.9 Mo. Much
effort has been spent to extend the equation of state down to the low
temperature and high density regime. An analysis of the latest improvement in
the physics of white dwarf interiors is presented. We conclude that at the
faint end of the cooling sequence (log L/Lo=-5.5) the present overall
uncertainty on the age is of the order of 20%, which correspond to about 3 Gyr.
We suggest that this uncertainty could be substantially reduced by improving
our knowledge of the conductive opacity (especially in the partially degenerate
regime) and by fixing the internal stratification of C and O.

compare them to the ones of Kimura's model of neutral evolution. Our study is
based on the Structurally Constrained Neutral (SCN) model which we recently
proposed. We show that, in the SCN model, the substitution rate decreases as
longer time intervals are considered, and fluctuates strongly from one branch
of the evolutionary tree to another, leading to a non-Poissonian statistics for
the substitution process. Such strong fluctuations are also due to the fact
that neutral substitution rates for individual residues are strongly correlated
for most residue pairs. Interestingly, structurally conserved residues,
characterized by a much below average substitution rate, are also much less
correlated to other residues and evolve in a much more regular way. Our results
could improve methods aimed at distinguishing between neutral and adaptive
substitutions as well as methods for computing the expected number of
substitutions occurred since the divergence of two protein sequences.

axis, using neutron scattering. The decrease of the magnetic intensity of the
tiny moment with increasing field does not follow a simple power law, but shows
a clear inflection point, indicating that the moment disappears first at the
metamagnetic transition at ~40 T. This suggests that the moment m is connected
to a hidden order parameter Phi which belongs to the same irreducible
representation breaking time-reversal symmetry. The magnetic excitation gap at
the antiferromagnetic zone center Q=(1,0,0) increases continuously with
increasing field, while that at Q=(1.4,0,0) is nearly constant. This field
dependence is opposite to that of the gap extracted from specific-heat data.

information or communication systems. In these contexts, the use of
grammar-independent input (sequences of uninflected semantic units like e.g.
language-independent icons) can be an answer to the users' needs. A semantic
analysis can be performed, based on lexical semantic knowledge: it is
equivalent to a dependency analysis with no syntactic or morphological clues.
However, this requires that an intelligent system should be able to interpret
this input with reasonable accuracy and in reasonable time. Here we propose a
method allowing a purely semantic-based analysis of sequences of semantic
units. It uses an algorithm inspired by the idea of ``chart parsing'' known in
Natural Language Processing, which stores intermediate parsing results in order
to bring the calculation time down. In comparison with using declarative logic
programming - where the calculation time, left to a prolog engine, is
hyperexponential -, this method brings the calculation time down to a
polynomial time, where the order depends on the valency of the predicates.

field-theoretical formulation of general relativity helped us to identify the
phenomenological seeds of such modifications. They take place in the form of
very specific mass-terms, which appear in addition to the field-theoretical
analog of the usual Hilbert-Einstein Lagrangian. We interpret the added terms
as masses of the spin-2 and spin-0 gravitons. The arising finite-range gravity
is a fully consistent theory, which smoothly approaches general relativity in
the massless limit, that is, when both masses tend to zero and the range of
gravity tends to infinity. We show that all local weak-field predictions of the
theory are in perfect agreement with the available experimental data. However,
some other conclusions of the non-linear massive theory are in a striking
contrast with those of general relativity. We show in detail how the
arbitrarily small mass-terms eliminate the black hole event horizon and replace
a permanent power-law expansion of a homogeneous isotropic universe with an
oscillatory behaviour. One variant of the theory allows the cosmological scale
factor to exhibit an `accelerated expansion'instead of slowing down to a
regular maximum of expansion. We show in detail why the traditional,
Fierz-Pauli, massive gravity is in conflict not only with the static-field
experiments but also with the available indirect gravitational-wave
observations. At the same time, we demonstrate the incorrectness of the widely
held belief that the non-Fierz-Pauli theories possess `negative energies' and

this work limits the choice of the link lengths to a finite number. This makes
the computational evaluation of the path integral much faster. A main concern
in lattice field theories is the existence of a continuum limit which requires
the existence of a continuous phase transition. The recently conjectured
second-order transition of the four-dimensional Regge skeleton at negative
gravity coupling could be such a candidate. We examine this regime with Monte
Carlo simulations and critically discuss its behavior.

to estimate the sensitivity of different observables to the magnitude of the
effective couplings. In a previous paper the dominant $W$-gluon fusion
mechanism was considered, while here we extend the analysis to the subdominant
(10% with our set of experimental cuts) s-channel process. In order to
distinguish left from right effective couplings it is required to consider
polarized cross-sections and/or include $m_b$ effects. The spin of the top is
accessible only indirectly by measuring the angular distribution of its decay
products. We show that the presence of effective right-handed couplings implies
necessarily that the top is not in a pure spin state. We discuss to what extent
quantum interference terms can be neglected in the measurement and therefore
simply multiply production and decay probabilities clasically. The coarsening
involved in the measurement process makes this possible. We determine for each
process the optimal spin basis where theoretical errors are minimized and,
finally, discuss the sensitivity in the s-channel to the effective right-handed
coupling. The results presented here are all analytical and include $m_b$
corrections. They are derived within the narrow width approximation for the

conditions for the regularized (quadratically and logarithmically) divergent
ILIs are obtained to maintain the generalized Ward identities of gauge
invariance in non-Abelian gauge theories. Overlapping UV divergences are
explicitly shown to be factorizable in the ILIs and be harmless via suitable
subtractions. A new regularization and renormalization method is presented in
the initial space-time dimension of the theory. The procedure respects
unitarity and causality. Of interest, the method leads to an infinity free
renormalization and meanwhile maintains the symmetry principles of the original
theory except the intrinsic mass scale caused conformal scaling symmetry
breaking and the anomaly induced symmetry breaking. Quantum field theories
(QFTs) regularized through the new method are well defined and governed by a
physically meaningful characteristic energy scale (CES) $M_c$ and a physically
interesting sliding energy scale (SES) $\mu_s$ which can run from $\mu_s \sim
M_c$ to a dynamically generated mass gap $\mu_s=\mu_c$ or to $\mu_s =0$ in the
absence of mass gap and infrared (IR) problem. It is strongly indicated that
the conformal scaling symmetry and its breaking mechanism play an important
role for understanding the mass gap and quark confinement.

takes place due to a quartic ghost interaction, unavoidably present in MAG for
renormalizability purposes. The off-diagonal mass can be seen as evidence for
Abelian dominance. We discuss why ghost condensation of the type discussed in
those works cannot be the reason for the off-diagonal mass and Abelian
dominance, since it results in a tachyonic mass. We also point out what the

a specific way of modeling which starts on the level of single proteins. Each
protein is represented by characteristics that are determined by single protein
experiments and that are considered to be widely independent of neuron types.
This allows the applications of the model to different classes of neurons and
experiments. The procedure is demonstrated for single boutons of pyramidal
neurons of the rat neocortex. The corresponding fluorescence measurements of

threshold stimulation frequency. The threshold frequency depends on the amount

observed during humoral immune responses: Some germinal centers develop very
well and give rise to a large number of high affinity antibody producing plasma
cells. Other germinal center reaction are very weak and the output production
is practically absent. We propose an explanation for this nearly all-or-none
behavior of germinal center reactions: The affinity of the seeder B-cells to
the antigen is the critical parameter that determines the fate of the germinal
center reaction. This hypothesis is verified in the framework of a space-time
simulation of germinal center reactions.

passage that allows to prepare cold atomic samples with a well defined ratio of
atomic density and atom number. This method is used to perform a measurement of
the cold collision frequency shift in a laser cooled cesium clock at the
percent level, which makes the evaluation of the cesium fountains accuracy at
the $10^{-16}$ level realistic. With an improved set-up, the adiabatic passage
would allow measurements of atom number-dependent phase shifts at the $10^{-3}$
level in high precision experiments.

absorption (EIA) coherence resonances in pump-probe spectroscopy of degenerate
two-level atomic transition is studied for light intensities below saturation.
Analytical expression for the transient absorption spectra are given for simple
model systems and a model for the calculation of the time dependent response of
realistic atomic transitions, where the Zeeman degeneracy is fully accounted
for, is presented. EIT and EIA resonances have a similar (opposite sign) time
dependent lineshape, however, the EIA evolution is slower and thus narrower
lines are observed for long interaction time. Qualitative agreement with the
theoretical predictions is obtained for the transient probe absorption on the
$^{85}Rb$ $D_{2}$ line in an atomic beam experiment.

derived in the literature on the entropic uncertainties of two observables

In the case of a two-dimensional Hilbert Space, the optimal bound for
successive measurements of two spin components, is seen to be strictly greater
than the optimal bound for the case when they are measured on distinct
ensembles, except when the spin components are mutually parallel or

existence of discontinuous motion of particles.

criteria we give examples of noisy channels such that (1) no information can be
corrected by such a scheme (2) for some basis B there is a correcting

equivalent to the channel allowing a representation as a convex combination of
isometric channels. Such channels are doubly stochastic but not conversely.
