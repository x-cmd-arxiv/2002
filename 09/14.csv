gravitational lensing mostly as a tool to boost the sensitivity when observing

lensed objects among those detected in CO rotational lines at z>1. It is also
evident in the use of lensing magnification by galaxy clusters in order to
reach faint submm/mm continuum sources. There are, however, a few cases where
millimeter lines have been directly involved in understanding lensing
configurations. Future mm/submm instruments, such as the ALMA interferometer,
will have both the sensitivity and the angular resolution to allow detailed
observations of gravitational lenses. The almost constant sensitivity to dust
emission over the redshift range z=1-10 means that the likelihood for strong
lensing of dust continuum sources is much higher than for optically selected
sources. A large number of new strong lenses are therefore likely to be
discovered with ALMA, allowing a direct assessment of cosmological parameters
through lens statistics. Combined with an angular resolution <0.1"", ALMA will
also be efficient for probing the gravitational potential of galaxy clusters,
where we will be able to study both the sources and the lenses themselves, free
of obscuration and extinction corrections, derive rotation curves for the
lenses, their orientation and, thus, greatly constrain lens models.

to the halo virial temperature before cooling to the much lower temperature of

compression, and radiating it just as quickly. This ``cold mode'' accretion is
channeled along filaments, while the conventional, ``hot mode'' accretion is
quasi-spherical. Cold mode accretion dominates high redshift growth by a
substantial factor, while at z<1 the overall accretion rate declines and hot
mode accretion has greater relative importance. The decline of the cosmic star
formation rate at low z is driven largely by geometry, as the typical cross

Chandra reveals sub-arcsecond structure, both in the brightness and in spectral
variations. Underlying these small-scale variations is a surprisingly simple
radial structure in the equivalent widths of the strong Si and S emission
lines. We investigate these radial variations through spatially resolved
spectroscopy using a plane-parallel, non-equilibrium ionization model with
multiple components. The majority of the emission arises from components with a
temperature of 1 keV: a fully ionized hydrogen component; a high ionization
timescale (n_e*t > 10^12 s cm^-3) component containing Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe;
and a low ionization timescale (n_e*t ~ 10^{11} s cm^-3) O, Ne, and Mg
component. To reproduce the strong Fe Kalpha line, it is necessary to include
additional Fe in a hot (> 2 keV), low ionization (n_e*t ~ 10^10.8 s cm^-3)
component. This hot Fe may be in the form of hot Fe bubbles, formed in the
radioactive decay of clumps of 56Ni. We find no radial variation in the
ionization timescales or temperatures of the various components. Rather, the Si
and S equivalent widths increase at large radii because these lines, as well as
those of Ar and Ca, are formed in a shell occupying the outer half of the
remnant. A shell of hot Fe is located interior to this, but there is a large
region of overlap between these two shells. In the inner 30% of the remnant,
there is a core of cooler, 1 keV Fe. We find that the distribution of the
ejecta and the yields of the intermediate mass species are consistent with

obtained after every iteration step give the distribution of electron density
which is not corresponded to the boundary conditions for the Coulomb potential.
As a result, either it is impossible to obtain the solution for the next
iteration step or some parameters of the system are to be changed, for example,
the density of the positive charge. The last way is disagreed with the
Euler-Lagrange variational derivation of the self-consistent equations. We

high temperature and discussed in terms of the fractal dimension of the
conducting network of the weakly conducting (so-called insulating) phase and
Orbach estimate of the excitation spectral behaviors. The need of considering
both independent spin scattering and collective spin scattering is thus
emphasized. The report indicates a remarkable agreement for the Fisher-Langer

parts: (1) a dynamical theory such as superstring theory, and (2) a state of
the universe such as Hawking's no-boundary wave function. Both are necessary
because prediction in quantum mechanics requires both a Hamiltonian and a
state. Complete ignorance of the state leads to predictions inconsistent with
observation. The simplicity observed in the early universe gives hope that
there is a simple, discoverable quantum state of the universe. It may be that,
like the dynamical theory, the predictions of the quantum state for late time,
low energy observations can be summarized by an effective cosmological theory.
That should not obscure the need to provide a fundamental basis for such an
effective theory which gives a a unified explanation of its features and is
applicable without restrictive assumptions. It could be that there is one
principle that determines both the dynamical theory and the quantum state. That
would be a truly unified final theory. (talk given The Future of Theoretical

atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations, as well as with those of the quark
and charged lepton masses and mixings, and the gravitino-constraint. Hereby one
obtains a unified description of fermion masses, neutrino oscillations and
baryogenesis (via leptogenesis) within a single predictive framework.

generalizes the regularity theorem of Ecker and Huisken for Lipschitz
hypersurfaces. In particular, any submanifold of the Euclidean space with a
continuous induced metric can be smoothed out by the mean curvature flow. The
smallness assumption is necessary in the higher codimension case in view of an
