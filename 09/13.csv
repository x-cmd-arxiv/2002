relativistic processes such as Doppler boosts, strong self-lensing,
frame-dragging, and the differential gravitational redshift arising from the
stellar oblateness. In this Letter, we calculate line profiles taking into
account the first two effects, which is accurate for rotation rates less than
the breakup frequency. We show that the line profiles are not only broadened
and weakened but are also significantly asymmetric, and allow for an
independent measurement of both the mass and the radius of the neutron star.
Furthermore, we investigate the case when a fraction of the neutron star
surface contributes to the emission and find that the line profiles are
typically doubly peaked. We discuss the implications of our results for
searches for line features in the spectra of isolated neutron stars and X-ray
bursters. We finally assess the systematic uncertainties introduced by the line
asymmetry in inferring the compactness of neutron stars from the detection of
redshifted lines.

that we derive from the Lick indices Mgb and Fe5270 are in excellent agreement
with the metallicity scale by Zinn & West (1984), and we show that the latter
provides total metallicity rather than iron abundance. We can reproduce the
relatively strong CN-absorption features CN1 and CN2 of galactic globular
clusters with models in which nitrogen is enhanced by a factor three. An
enhancement of carbon, instead, would lead to serious inconsistencies with the

is well matched by our models with [Ca/Fe]= 0.3, including the metal-rich Bulge

the index [MgFe] defined by Gonzalez (1993) is quite independent of alpha/Fe,
but still slightly decreases with increasing alpha/Fe. We define a slight
modification of this index that is completely independent of alpha/Fe and
serves best as a tracer of total metallicity. Searching for blue indices that
give similar information as Mgb and Fe, we find that CN1 and Fe4383 may be best
suited to estimate alpha/Fe ratios of objects at redshifts z~1. (Abridged)

supermassive black hole (SMBH) has been followed recently by means of
hydrodynamic simulations in full general relativity. The initial SMS of
arbitrary mass M in these simulations rotates uniformly at the mass--shedding
limit and is marginally unstable to radial collapse. The final black hole has
mass M_h/M = 0.9 and and spin J_h/M_h^2 = 0.75, approximately. The remaining
mass goes into a disk of mass M_disk/M = 0.1, also approximately. Here we show
that these black hole and disk parameters can be calculated analytically from
the initial stellar density and angular momentum distribution. The analytic
calculation thereby corroborates and provides a simple physical explanation for
the computational discovery that SMS collapse inevitably terminates in the
simultaneous formation of a SMBH and a rather substantial ambient disk. This
disk arises even though the total spin of the progenitor star, J/M^2 = 0.97, is
safely below the Kerr limit. The calculation performed here applies to any
marginally unstable n = 3 polytrope uniformly rotating at the break--up speed,
independent of stellar mass or the source of internal pressure. It illustrates
how the black hole and disk parameters can be determined for the collapse of
other types of stars with different initial density and rotation profiles.

Earth has been previously associated with variations in the global low altitude
cloud cover. This CRF variability arises from changes in the solar wind
strength. However, cosmic ray variability also arises intrinsically from
variable activity of and motion through the Milky Way. Thus, if indeed the CRF
climate connection is real, the increased CRF witnessed while crossing the
spiral arms could be responsible for a larger global cloud cover and a reduced
temperature, thereby facilitating the occurrences of ice ages. This picture has
been recently shown to be supported by various data (Shaviv, 2001). In
particular, the variable CRF recorded in Iron meteorites appears to vary
synchronously with the appearance ice ages.
  Here we expand upon the original treatment with a more thorough analysis and
more supporting evidence. In particular, we discuss the cosmic ray diffusion
model which considers the motion of the Galactic spiral arms. We also elaborate
on the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way's spiral arms. In particular, we
bring forth new argumentation using HI observations which imply that the
galactic spiral arm pattern speed appears to be that which fits the glaciation
period and the cosmic-ray flux record extracted from Iron meteorites. In
addition, we show that apparent peaks in the star formation rate history, as
deduced by several authors, coincides with particularly icy epochs, while the
long period of 1 to 2 Gyr before present, during which no glaciations are known
to have occurred, coincides with a significant paucity in the past star
formation rate.

precise prediction of the solar B8 neutrino flux. We therefore examine the
effect of pressure ionization on the ionization state of Be7 and all elements
with 12 >= Z >= 4. We show that under the conditions prevailing in the solar
core, one has to consider the effect of the nearest neighbor on the electronic
structure of a given ion. To this goal, we first solve the Schroedinger and
then the Kohn-Sham equations for an ion immersed in a dense plasma under
conditions for which the mean interparticle distance is smaller than the Debye
radius. The question of which boundary conditions should be imposed on the wave
function is discussed, examined and found to be crucial.
  Contrary to previous estimates showing that Beryllium is partially ionized,
we find that it is fully ionized. As a consequence, the predicted rate of the
Be7 + e- reaction is reduced by 20-30%, depending on the exact solar model.
Since Be7 is a trace element, its total production is controlled by the
unchanged He4+He3 reaction rate, and its destruction is determined by the rate
of electron capture. As the latter rate decreases when the Beryllium is fully
ionized (relative to the case of partially ionized Be), the estimate for the
abundance of Be7 increases and with it the B8 neutrino flux. The increase in
phi_nu(B8) is by about 20-30%. The neutrino flux due to Be7 electron capture
remains effectively unchanged because the change in the rate is compensated for
by a change in the abundance. Hence the prediction for the ratio of phi_nu(B8)
/ phi_nu(Be7) changes as well.

contain SMBHs, with masses proportional to the total luminous mass in the

tension at the interface between hadronic and deconfined-quark-matter phases is
taken into account. The nucleation time (i.e. the time to form a critical-size
drop of quark matter) can be extremely long if the mass of the star is small.
Via mass accretion the nucleation time can be dramaticaly reduced and the star
is finally converted into the stable configuration. A huge amount of energy, of
the order of 10$^{52}$--10$^{53}$ erg, is released during the conversion
process and can produce a powerful Gamma Ray Burst. The delay between the

surface density gradient between the depleted region inside the ring and the
inner border of the ring. The CO nuclear ring is significantly broader
(500-600pc) than the dust lane ring. The CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ratio is around 1,
typical of optically thick gas with high density. The overall morphology of the
ring is quite circular, with no evidence of non-circular velocities. In the
CO(2-1) map, a central concentration might be associated with the circumnuclear
ring of ionised gas detected inside r=3"" and interpreted as a polar ring by
Sil'chenko and Afanasiev (2000). Our interpretation is more in terms of a
bar/spiral structure, in the same plane as the global galaxy but affected by
non-circular motions, which results in a characteristic S-shape of the isovels.
This nuclear bar/spiral structure, clearly seen in a V-I HST colour image, is
essentially gaseous and might be explained with acoustic waves.

that for systems with a time-reversal invariant steady state there exists a
stochastic differential for which then the Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry, and all
its consequences, are valid for finite times. For these systems the
differential can be seen as the direct analogy of the Gibbs-entropy creation
along paths in deterministic systems. It differs from previously studied

near the quantum Hall plateau transition can be described in a theory of the
bosonic density operators, with no reference to the underlying fermions. The
resulting ``Liouvillian'' theory has a $U(1|1)$ global supersymmetry as well as
a hierarchy of geometric conservation laws related to the noncommutative
geometry of the lowest Landau level (LLL). Approximations to the Liouvillian
theory contain quite different physics from standard approximations to the
underlying fermionic theory. Mean-field and large-N generalizations of the
Liouvillian are shown to describe problems of noninteracting bosons that
enlarge the $U(1|1)$ supersymmetry to $U(1|1) \times SO(N)$ or $U(1|1) \times
SU(N)$.
  These noninteracting bosonic problems are studied numerically for $2 \leq N
\leq 8$ by Monte Carlo simulation and compared to the original N=1 Liouvillian
theory. The $N>1$ generalizations preserve the first two of the hierarchy of
geometric conservation laws, leading to logarithmic corrections at order 1/N to
the diffusive large-N limit, but do not preserve the remaining conservation
laws. The emergence of nontrivial scaling at the plateau transition, in the
Liouvillian approach, is shown to depend sensitively on the unusual geometry of
Landau levels.

results depending whether the starting FBM is persistent or not, i.e. depending

antiferromagnets with very weak easy-axis and easy-plane exchange anisotropies.
By means of quantum Monte Carlo simulations, based on the continuous-time loop
and worm algorithm, we obtain a rich set of data that allows us to draw
conclusions about both the existence and the type of finite-temperature
transition expected in the considered models. We observe that the essential
features of the Ising universality class, as well as those of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) one, are preserved even for anisotropies
as small as 10^{-3} times the exchange integral; such outcome, being referred
to the most quantum case S=1/2, rules out the possibility for quantum
fluctuations to destroy the long or quasi-long range order, whose onset is
responsible for the Ising or BKT transition, no matter how small the
anisotropy. Besides this general issue, we use our results to extract, out of
the isotropic component, the features which are peculiar to weakly anisotropic
models, with particular attention for the temperature region immediately above
the transition. By this analysis we aim to give a handy tool for understanding
the experimental data relative to those real compounds whose anisotropies are
too weak for a qualitative description to accomplish the goal of singling out
the genuinely two-dimensional critical behaviour.

giant quasi-spherical vesicle formed of a single lipid species is revisited
theoretically. A coherent physical theory for the dynamics is developed based
on a number of fundamental principles and considerations and a systematic
formulation of the theory is also established. From the systematic theoretical
formulation, an analytical description of the dynamics of shape fluctuations of
quasi-spherical vesicles is derived. In particular, in developing the theory we
have made a new interpretation of some of the phenomenological constants in a
canonical continuum description of fluid lipid-bilayer membranes and shown the
consequences of this new interpretation in terms of the characteristics of the
dynamics of vesicle shape fluctuations. Moreover, we have used the systematic
formulation of our theory as a framework against which we have discussed the
previously existing theories and their discrepancies. Finally, we have made a
systematic prediction about the system-dependent characteristics of the
relaxation dynamics of shape fluctuations of quasi-spherical vesicles with a
view of experimental studies of the phenomenon and also discussed, based on our
theory, a recently published experimental work on the topic.

are some products of generators of the algebra ${\bf D}(\iota)$ and $t_{ik}$

quantum orthogonal groups essentially depend on the choice of primitive
elements of the Hopf algebra. All such choices are considered for quantum group
$SO_{q}(N;C)$ and all allowed contractions in Cayley--Klein scheme are
described.

algebraic geometry are used to formulate a direct and intrinsic link between
the geometry of Calabi-Yau manifolds and aspects of the underlying conformal
field theory. As an application the algebraic number field determined by the
fusion rules of the conformal field theory is derived from the number theoretic
structure of the cohomological Hasse-Weil L-function determined by Artin's
congruent zeta function of the algebraic variety. In this context a natural
number theoretic characterization arises for the quantum dimensions in this
geometrically determined algebraic number field.

advection in chaotic flows generated by four and sixteen point vortices are
investigated. General transport properties of these flows are found anomalous
and exhibit a superdiffusive behavior with typical second moment exponent (\mu
\sim 1.75). The origin of this anomaly is traced back to the presence of
coherent structures within the flow, the vortex cores and the region far from
where vortices are located. In the vicinity of these regions stickiness is
observed and the motion of tracers is quasi-ballistic. The chaotic nature of
the underlying flow dictates the choice for thorough analysis of transport
properties. Passive tracer motion is analyzed by measuring the mutual relative
evolution of two nearby tracers. Some tracers travel in each other vicinity for
relatively large times. This is related to an hidden order for the tracers
which we call jets. Jets are localized and found in sticky regions. Their
structure is analyzed and found to be formed of a nested sets of jets within
jets. The analysis of the jet trapping time statistics shows a quantitative
agreement with the observed transport exponent.

correlation function, whose stretching exponent is almost constant and
correlation time is linear as functions of degrees of freedom. The full time
evolution is characterized by varying stretching exponent and correlation time.

equilibrium description which avoids the problem of the vapor and explains the

scale according to Fisher's formula and can be simultaneously fit with the much

to push its end point to the desired position, step by step. The method is also
useful to obtain configurations of rods with fixed end points but different

system of fixed number of clusters. Two existing structures from a given
population are combined in a special way to produce a new structure (child)
which is kept if its energy is lower than the highest energy in the ensemble.
To keep the population constant we reject the structure with the highest
energy. This algorithm gives a better result than the optimization techniques
used previously. Using the GA we have found a new structure corresponding to
the (seemingly) global minimum. The most important result is that the new
structure is detected only if the molecular cluster contains more than a
critical number of molecules.
