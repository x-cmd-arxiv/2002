regions of the symbiotic system CH Cygni are analysed. These extensions are
evidence of a strong collimation mechanism, probably an accretion disk
surrounding the hot component of the system. Over 16 years (between 1985 and
2001) the general trend is that these jets are seen to precess. Fitting a
simple ballistic model of matter ejection to the geometry of the extended
regions suggests a period of 6520 +/- 150 days, with a precession cone opening
angle of 35 +/- 1 degrees. This period is of the same order as that proposed
for the orbital period of the outer giant in the system, suggesting a possible
link between the two. Anomalous knots in the emission, not explained by the
simple model, are believed to be the result of older, slower moving ejecta, or
possibly jet material that has become disrupted through sideways interaction
with the surrounding medium.

spectrum in the 0.7--10 keV ASCA bandpass, which looks like a high temperature
analogue of the disk dominated high/soft state spectra seen in Galactic black
hole binaries (BHBs) at high mass accretion rates. Several ULXs have been seen
to vary, and to make a transition at their lowest luminosity to a spectrum
which looks more like a power law. These have been previously interpreted as
the analogue of the power law dominated low/hard state in Galactic BHBs.
However, the ULX luminosity at which the transition occurs must be at least
10--50 per cent of the Eddington limit assuming that their highest luminosity
phase corresponds to the Eddington limit, while for the Galactic BHBs the
high/soft--low/hard transition occurs at a few per cent of the Eddington limit.
Here we show that the apparently power law spectrum in a ULX in IC342 can be
equally well fit over the ASCA bandpass by a strongly Comptonised optically
thick accretion disk with the maximum temperature of ~1 keV. Recent work on the
Galactic BHBs has increasingly shown that such components are common at high
mass accretion rates, and that this often characterises the very high (or
anomalous) state. Thus we propose that the power law type ULX spectra are not
to be identified with the low/hard state, but rather represent the
Comptonisation dominated very high/anomalous state in the Galactic BHBs.

that constrains in a simple way the galaxy luminosity function evolution with
the redshift, and fits all the existing source counts and redshift
distributions, Cosmic Infrared Background intensity and fluctuations
observations, from the mid-infrared to the submillimetre range. The model is
based on template spectra of starburst and normal galaxies, and on the local
infrared luminosity function. Although the Cosmic Infrared Background can be
modeled with very different luminosity functions as long as the radiation
production with redshift is the right one, the number counts, and the
anisotropies of the unresolved background, imply that the luminosity function
must change dramatically with redshift, with a rapid evolution of the
high-luminosity sources (L>3 10^{11} L_{\odot}) from z=0 to z=1 which then stay
rather constant up to redshift 5. The derived evolution of the IR luminosity
function may be linked to a bimodal star formation process, one associated with
the quiescent and passive phase of the galaxy evolution and one associated with
the starburst phase, trigerred by merging and interactions. The latter
dominates the infrared and submillimetre ouput energy of the Universe.
  The model is intended as a convenient tool to plan further observations, as
illustrated through predictions for Herschel, Planck and ALMA observations. Our
model predictions for given wavelengths, together with some usefull routines,

that the transition back to the hard state occurs at a luminosity $\sim $ 5

rules out the propeller mechanism as the sole cause of state transitions in Aql
X-1. Assuming the propeller mechanism only operates at a luminosity equal to or
below that of the observed soft-to-hard transition requires that the magnetic
field of Aql X-1 be less than $7\times 10^7$ Gauss, the lowest neutron star
field known to date. To compare the state transition behavior of Aql X-1 with
that found in transient black hole systems, we use RXTE ASM data to compute
hardness-intensity diagrams for four black hole candidate transients where the
ASM data should also give us state information throughout much of the outburst
cycles. In all four systems, we find evidence for a hard-to-soft state
transition during the rising outburst phase and for the source staying in a
soft state down to much lower luminosities during the declining phase, i.e., a
hysteresis effect. This similarity suggests a common origin for state
transitions in low magnetic field neutron star and black hole systems, and the
hysteresis effect rules out the ``Strong ADAF Principle'' for determining the
state of an accretion disc. We discuss the general implications of these

previous observations of the non-transient systems Cygnus X-1 and X-3 which do

present the first molecular dynamics simulation for these systems. Different
nanotube types were considered in order to verify the reliability of such

molecular devices are since recently subject of intense studies both

relaxation dynamics of a small model glass former of Lennard-Jones type. The
mechanism under investigation is the hopping betweem superstructures of PEL
mimima, called metabasins (MB). From the mean durations $\tauphi$ of visits to
MBs, we derive effective depths of these objects by the relation
$\Eapp=\d\ln\tauphi/\d\beta$, where $\beta=1/\kB T$. Since the apparent
activation energies $\Eapp$ are of purely dynamical origin, we look for a
quantitative relation to PEL structure. A consequence of the rugged nature of
MBs is that escapes from MBs are not single hops between PEL minima, but
complicated multi-minima sequences. We introduce the concept of return
probabilities to the bottom of MBs in order to judge whether the attraction
range of a MB was left. We then compute the energy barriers that were
surmounted. These turn out to be in good agreement with the effective depths
$\Eapp$, calculated from dynamics. Barriers are identified with the help of a
new method, which accurately performs a descent along the ridge between two
minima. A comparison to another method is given. We analyze the population of
transition regions between minima, called basin borders. No indication for the
mechanism of diffusion to change around the mode-coupling transition can be
found. We discuss the question whether the one-dimensional reaction paths
connecting two minima are relevant for the calculation of reaction rates at the
temperatures under study.

transitions occur. While the bulk layering and intra-layering transitions
appear above an other finite temperature $T_{L}^{b} (\ge T_{L}^{s})$. These
surface and bulk intra-layering transitions are not seen in the perfect
surfaces case.
  Numerical values of $T_{L}^{s}$ and $T_{L}^{b}$, computed by Monte Carlo

However, the results predicted by the two methods become similar, and are
exactly those given by the ground state phase diagram, for very low

function of the external magnetic field, shows that the transitions are of the
first order type. $T_{L}^{s}$ and $T_{L}^{b}$ decrease when increasing the

reaches the wetting temperature $T_{w}$ for sufficiently large system sizes.

structural relaxation near the interface. Bipolarons are the lowest energy

calculated using a technique that combines a continuous Poisson-Boltzmann
description for the microscopic electrolyte ions with a molecular-dynamics
simulation for the macroionic colloidal spheres. While correlations between the
microions are neglected in this approach, many-body interactions between the
colloids are fully included. The solid-liquid transition is determined at a
high colloid volume fraction where many-body interactions are expected to be
strong. With a view to the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory predicting
that colloids interact via Yukawa pair-potentials, we compare our results with
the phase diagram of a simple Yukawa liquid. Good agreement is found at high
salt conditions, while at low ionic strength considerable deviations are
observed. By calculating effective colloid-colloid pair-interactions it is
demonstrated that these differences are due to many-body interactions. We
suggest a density-dependent pair-potential in the form of a truncated Yukawa
potential, and show that it offers a considerably improved description of the
solid-liquid phase-behavior of concentrated colloidal suspensions.

along the anisotropy direction, but with a field magnitude smaller than the
coercive field. There are three representative magnetization configurations
corresponding to three extrema of the free energy. The equilibrium and
metastable configurations, which are magnetized approximately parallel and
antiparallel to the applied field, respectively, both correspond to local
free-energy minima. The third extremum configuration is the saddle point
separating these minima. It is also called the transition state for
magnetization reversal. The free-energy difference between the metastable and
transition-state configurations determines the thermal stability of the magnet.
However, it is difficult to determine the location of the transition state in
both experiments and numerical simulations. Here it is shown that the
computational Projective Dynamics method, applied to the time dependence of the
total magnetization, can be used to determine the transition state. From
large-scale micromagnetic simulations of a simple model of magnetic nanowires
with no crystalline anisotropy, the magnetization associated with the
transition state is found to be linearly dependent on temperature, and the
free-energy barrier is found to be dominated by the entropic contribution at
reasonable temperatures and external fields. The effect of including
crystalline anisotropy is also discussed. Finally, the influence of the spin
precession on the transition state is determined by comparison of the
micromagnetic simulations to kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of precession-free
(overdamped) dynamics.

various optimizations, many routing messages are propagated unnecessarily. We
propose a gossiping-based approach, where each node forwards a message with
some probability, to reduce the overhead of the routing protocols. Gossiping
exhibits bimodal behavior in sufficiently large networks: in some executions,
the gossip dies out quickly and hardly any node gets the message; in the
remaining executions, a substantial fraction of the nodes gets the message. The
fraction of executions in which most nodes get the message depends on the
gossiping probability and the topology of the network. In the networks we have
considered, using gossiping probability between 0.6 and 0.8 suffices to ensure
that almost every node gets the message in almost every execution. For large
networks, this simple gossiping protocol uses up to 35% fewer messages than
flooding, with improved performance. Gossiping can also be combined with
various optimizations of flooding to yield further benefits. Simulations show
that adding gossiping to AODV results in significant performance improvement,
even in networks as small as 150 nodes. We expect that the improvement should
be even more significant in larger networks.

transmission power at each node. In this paper, we give a detailed analysis of
a cone-based distributed topology control algorithm. This algorithm, introduced
in [16], does not assume that nodes have GPS information available; rather it
depends only on directional information. Roughly speaking, the basic idea of
the algorithm is that a node $u$ transmits with the minimum power
$p_{u,\alpha}$ required to ensure that in every cone of degree $\alpha$ around
$u$, there is some node that $u$ can reach with power $p_{u,\alpha}$. We show
that taking $\alpha = 5\pi/6$ is a necessary and sufficient condition to
guarantee that network connectivity is preserved. More precisely, if there is a
path from $s$ to $t$ when every node communicates at maximum power, then, if
$\alpha <= 5\pi/6$, there is still a path in the smallest symmetric graph
$G_\alpha$ containing all edges $(u,v)$ such that $u$ can communicate with $v$
using power $p_{u,\alpha}$. On the other hand, if $\alpha > 5\pi/6$,
connectivity is not necessarily preserved. We also propose a set of
optimizations that further reduce power consumption and prove that they retain
network connectivity. Dynamic reconfiguration in the presence of failures and
mobility is also discussed. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the algorithm and the optimizations.

  Applications International Forum (STAIF-2003)",,"10.1063/1.1541386",,"gr-qc",,"  A possible connection between the electromagnetic quantum vacuum and inertia
was first published by Haisch, Rueda and Puthoff (1994). If correct, this would
imply that mass may be an electromagnetic phenomenon and thus in principle
subject to modification, with possible technological implications for
propulsion. A multiyear NASA-funded study at the Lockheed Martin Advanced
Technology Center further developed this concept, resulting in an independent
theoretical validation of the fundamental approach (Rueda and Haisch, 1998ab).
Distortion of the quantum vacuum in accelerated reference frames results in a
force that appears to account for inertia. We have now shown that the same
effect occurs in a region of curved spacetime, thus elucidating the origin of
the principle of equivalence (Rueda, Haisch and Tung, 2001). A further
connection with general relativity has been drawn by Nickisch and Mollere
(2002): zero-point fluctuations give rise to spacetime micro-curvature effects
yielding a complementary perspective on the origin of inertia. Numerical
simulations of this effect demonstrate the manner in which a massless
fundamental particle, e.g. an electron, acquires inertial properties; this also
shows the apparent origin of particle spin along lines originally proposed by
Schroedinger. Finally, we suggest that the heavier leptons (muon and tau) may
be explainable as spatial-harmonic resonances of the (fundamental) electron.
They would carry the same overall charge, but with the charge now having
spatially lobed structure, each lobe of which would respond to higher frequency
components of the electromagnetic quantum vacuum, thereby increasing the
inertia and thus manifesting a heavier mass.

is only true within the domain of dependence of the initial data. If one wishes
to consider situations where the evolutions are studied for longer intervals
than the size of the domain of dependence, as is usually the case in three
dimensional numerical relativity, one needs to give boundary data. The boundary
data should be specified in such a way that the constraints are satisfied
everywhere, at all times. In this paper we address this problem for the case of
general relativity linearized around Minkowski space using the generalized
Einstein-Christoffel symmetric hyperbolic system of evolution equations. We
study the evolution equations for the constraints, specify boundary conditions
for them that make them well posed and further choose these boundary conditions
in such a way that the evolution equations for the metric variables are also
well posed. We also consider the case of a manifold with a non-smooth boundary,
as is the usual case of the cubic boxes commonly used in numerical relativity.
The techniques discussed should be applicable to more general cases, as
linearizations around more complicated backgrounds, and may be used to
establish well posedness in the full non-linear case.

different radii leads to running hidden brane couplings. The hidden brane
Lagrangian consists of four-dimensional local operators constructed from the

simplified by ``running down'' the effective theory to a small radius. We

investigated within a chemical and thermal equilibrium chiral SU(3)
\sigma-\omega approach. The commonly adopted noninteracting gas calculations
yield temperatures close to or above the critical temperature for the chiral
phase transition, but without taking into account any interactions. Contrary,
the chiral SU(3) model predicts temperature and density dependent effective
hadron masses and effective chemical potentials in the medium and a transition
to a chirally restored phase at high temperatures or chemical potentials. Three
different parametrizations of the model, which show different types of phase
transition behaviour, are investigated. We show that if a chiral phase
transition occured in those collisions, ''freezing'' of the relative hadron
abundances in the symmetric phase is excluded by the data. Therefore, either
very rapid chemical equilibration must occur in the broken phase, or the
measured hadron ratios are the outcome of the dynamical symmetry breaking.
Furthermore, the extracted chemical freeze-out parameters differ considerably
from those obtained in simple noninteracting gas calculations. In particular,
the three models yield up to 35 MeV lower temperatures than the free gas
approximation. The in-medium masses turn out differ up to 150 MeV from their
vacuum values.

an unconstrained variational principle. This approach provides a natural way of
obtaining the general equations of motion for a wide range of hydrodynamic
systems containing an arbitrary number of interacting fluids and superfluids.
In addition to spatial variations we use ``time shifts'' in the variational
principle, which allows us to describe dissipative processes with entropy
creation, such as chemical reactions, friction or the effects of external
non-conservative forces. The resulting framework incorporates the
generalization of the entrainment effect originally discussed in the case of
the mixture of two superfluids by Andreev and Bashkin. In addition to the
conservation of energy and momentum, we derive the generalized conservation
laws of vorticity and helicity, and the special case of Ertel's theorem for the
single perfect fluid.
  We explicitly discuss the application of this framework to thermally
conducting fluids, superfluids, and superfluid neutron star matter. The
equations governing thermally conducting fluids are found to be more general
than the standard description, as the effect of entrainment usually seems to be
overlooked in this context. In the case of superfluid He4 we recover the
Landau--Khalatnikov equations of the two-fluid model via a translation to the
``orthodox'' framework of superfluidity, which is based on a rather awkward
choice of variables. Our two-fluid model for superfluid neutron star matter
allows for dissipation via mutual friction and also ``transfusion'' via
beta-reactions between the neutron fluid and the proton-electron fluid.

of particles in the origin. It is shown, that suggested regularization is an
analytical continuation of the scattering amplitudes of repulsive singular
potential in interaction constant $\alpha_{s}$. The nearthreshold properties of
regularized in a mentioned way singular potential are examined. We obtain
expressions for the scattering lengths, which turn to be complex even for

perturbation of nearthreshold states of regular potential by a singular one is
treated, the expressions for level shifts and widths are obtained. We show,
that the physical sense of suggested regularization is that the scattering
observables are insensitive to any details of the short range modification of
singular potential, if there exists sufficiently strong inelastic short range
interaction. In this case the scattering observables are determined by
solutions of Schrodinger equation with regularized potential $-(\alpha_{s}\pm

relative entropy. The aim of this paper is to investigate the condition of
equality in the monotonicity theorem and in its consequences such as the strong
sub-additivity of the von Neumann entropy, the Golden-Thompson trace inequality
and the monotonicity of the Holevo quantity.The relation to quantum Markovian
states is briefly indicated.

B 5 (2003) S416","10.1088/1464-4266/5/3/380",,"quant-ph",,"  The impact of an anti-unitary symmetry on the spectrum of non-hermitean
operators is studied. Wigner's normal form of an anti-unitary operator is shown
to account for the spectral properties of non-hermitean, PT-symmetric
Hamiltonians. Both the occurrence of single real or complex conjugate pairs of
eigenvalues follows from this theory. The corresponding energy eigenstates span
either one- or two-dimensional irreducible representations of the symmetry PT.
In this framework, the concept of a spontaneously broken PT-symmetry is not
needed.
