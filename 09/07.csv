variability in the high luminosity radio-quiet quasar PDS 456, the most
luminous known AGN at z<0.3. Repeated X-ray flaring is found in PDS 456, over
the duration of the 340 ksec long Beppo-SAX observation. The X-ray flux doubles
in just 30 ksec, whilst the total energy output of the flaring events is as
high as 10^51 erg. Under the assumption of isotropic emission at the Eddington
limit, this implies that the size of the X-ray emitting region in PDS 456 is
less than 3 Schwarzschild radii, for a 10^9 solar mass black hole. From the
rates of change of luminosity observed during the X-ray flares, we calculate
lower limits for the radiative efficiency between 0.06 and 0.41, implying that
accretion onto a Kerr black hole is likely in PDS 456. We suggest that the
rapid variability is from X-ray flares produced through magnetic reconnection
above the disc and calculate that the energetics and timescale of the flares
are plausible if the quasar is accreting near to the maximum Eddington rate. A
similar mechanism may account for the extreme rapid X-ray variability observed
in many Narrow Line Seyfert 1s. In the case of PDS 456, we show that the X-ray
flaring could be reproduced through a self-induced cascade of about 1000
individual flares over a timescale of the order 1 day.

WIMP dark matter through precision studies of gamma rays produced in pair
annihilations. The most dense region of dark matter in our galaxy is currently
thought to occur at the center; in particular, dark matter should concentrate
within 3 pc of the putative supermassive black hole located at the SgrA* radio
source. In fact, the 2nd and 3rd EGRET catalogs contain a significant point
source coincident with the Milky Way galactic center within a resolution of 12
arcminutes. The EGRET team has determined that the spectral and temporal
characteristics of this point source are consistent with dark matter WIMP
annihilations. More detailed analysis has determined that the magnitude and
spectrum of the EGRET source is consistent with relic WIMPs concentrated within
3 pc of the central supermassive black hole. Furthermore, the SgrA* radio
emission is consistent with the synchrotron radiation expected from electrons
and positrons produced in WIMP annihilations. If true, then GLAST should be
able to constrain the particle properties of the postulated WIMP with 1 month
of data.

for these sources than for more powerful AGN. Fractional linear polarization in
detected sources is also lower than in more powerful AGN. The weak linear
polarization in the survey sources indicates their overall similarity to Sgr
A*. Confusion with thermal sources, depolarization and weaker, less extended

Balmer lines (HgammaA,F and HdeltaA,F) from the Lick/IDS observations are given

sample the bimodal colour distribution of NGC3115 are coeval within our

diagram (Hbeta vs [MgFe]) indicates an absolute age of 11-12 Gyr. We confirm
with our accurate line-strength measurements that the (V-I) colour is a good
metallicity indicator within the probed metallicity range. The abundance ratios
for globular clusters in NGC3115 give an inhomogeneous picture. We find a range
from solar to super-solar ratios for both blue and red clusters. From our
accurate recession velocities we detect, independent of metallicity, clear
rotation in the sample of globular clusters. In order to explain the
metallicity and abundance ratio pattern, particularly the range in abundance
ratios for the metal rich globular clusters in NGC3115, we favour a formation

developed the Fourier Transform (FT) of a continuous gravitational wave (CGW)
for ground based laser interferometric detectors for the data set of one day
observation time incorporating the effects arising due to rotational as well as
orbital motion of the earth. The transform is applicable for arbitrary location
of detector and source. In Chapter four we have generalized the FT for the data
set for (i) one year observation time and (ii) arbitrary observation time. As
an application of the transform we considered spin down and N-component signal
analysis. In fifth Chapter we have made an analysis of the number of templates
required for matched filter analysis as applicable to these sources. We have
employed the concept of {\it Fitting Factor (FF)}; treating the source location
as the parameters of the signal manifold and have studied the matching of the
signal with templates corresponding to different source locations. We have
investigated the variation of {\it FF} with source location and have noticed a
symmetry in template parameters, $\theta_T$ and $\phi_T$. It has been found
that the two different template values in source location, each in $\theta_T$
and $\phi_T$, have same {\it FF}. We have also computed the number of templates
required assuming the noise power spectral density $S_n(f)$ to be flat. It is
observed that higher {\it FF} requires exponentially increasing large number of

massive spin-two field generated in higher-derivative gravity. It has been
noticed by various authors that this nonlinear field overcomes the well known
inconsistency of the theory for a linear massive spin-two field interacting
with Einstein's gravity. Starting from a Lagrangian quadratically depending on
the Ricci tensor of the metric, we explore the two possible second-order
pictures usually called ""(Helmholtz-)Jordan frame"" and ""Einstein frame"". In
spite of their mathematical equivalence, the two frames have different
structural properties: in Einstein frame, the spin-two field is minimally
coupled to gravity, while in the other frame it is necessarily coupled to the
curvature, without a separate kinetic term. We prove that the theory admits a
unique and linearly stable ground state solution, and that the equations of
motion are consistent, showing that these results can be obtained independently
in either frame. The full equations of motion and the energy-momentum tensor
for the spin--two field in Einstein frame are given, and a simple but
nontrivial exact solution to these equations is found. The comparison of the
energy-momentum tensors for the spin-two field in the two frames suggests that
the Einstein frame is physically more acceptable. We point out that the
energy-momentum tensor generated by the Lagrangian of the linearized theory is
unrelated to the corresponding tensor of the full theory. It is then argued
that the ghost-like nature of the nonlinear spin-two field, found long ago in
the linear approximation, may not be so harmful to classical stability issues,
as has been expected.

converge towards values exponentially close to the exact ones. For lambda
larger than some critical value, the method outperforms Pade approximants and

approach of the instanton contribution. Semi-classical methods can be used to
calculate the modified Feynman rules, estimate the error and optimize the field

comparable to the averaged quark-quark distance at lower density. We also
consider the same problem in two-color QCD.

involving strongly-interacting mirror fermions. As a paradigm which has been
explicitly shown to predict correctly the weak scale and the weak angle and
thus addressing successfully the essence of the hierarchy problem of energy
scales (contrary to ""supersymmetric"" or ""extra-dimension"" models) and the
unification of fundamental forces, it might have already manifested indirectly
its validity experimentally, as first noted by the author in 1998, via the
bottom-quark forward-backward asymmetry and the related coupling parameter A_b.
After a decade during which the particle-physics community was frequently
misled by a particularly obscurantist interpretation of the L.E.P./S.L.C.
precision data, this approach emerges as a strong candidate for new physics
beyond the standard model of elementary particles to be thoroughly tested in
the forthcoming high-energy experiments.

the unitarity threshold, a long multiplet can be decomposed into four
semi-short multiplets. If the conformal primary state is spinless one of these
becomes a short multiplet. For $\N=4$ a ${1\over 4}$-BPS multiplet need not

but with no other approximations are ""exact."". Exact equations relating second-
and third-order structure functions are studied, as is an exact
incompressibility condition on the second-order velocity structure function.
Opportunities for investigations using these equations are discussed. Precisely
defined averaging operations are required to obtain exact averaged equations.
Ensemble, temporal, and spatial averages are all considered because they
produce different statistical equations and because they apply to theoretical
purposes, experiment, and numerical simulation of turbulence. Particularly
simple exact equations are obtained for the following cases: i) the trace of
the structure functions, ii) DNS that has periodic boundary conditions, and
iii) an average over a sphere in r-space. The last case (iii) introduces the
average over orientations of r into the structure function equations. The
energy dissipation rate appears in the exact trace equation without averaging,
whereas in previous formulations energy dissipation rate appears after
averaging and use of local isotropy. The trace mitigates the effect of
anisotropy in the equations, thereby revealing that the trace of the
third-order structure function is expected to be superior for quantifying
asymptotic scaling laws. The orientation average has the same property.

grating with shorter period makes mode selection for short wavelength
radiation. Lasing of such a system in terahertz frequency range is discussed.

evolution of terrestrial mammals. Analysis is given by means of testing of the
power scaling laws established in long bone allometry, which describe
development of bones (of length $L$ and diameter $D$) with body mass in terms
of the growth exponents, \QTR{it}{e.g.} $\lambda =d\log L/d\log D$. The
bone-size evolution scenario given three decades ago by McMahon was quiet
explicit on the geometrical-shape and mechanical-force constraints that
predicted $\lambda =2/3$. This remains too far from the mammalian allometric
exponent $\lambda ^{(\exp)}=0.80\pm 0.2$, recently revised by Christiansen,
that is a chief puzzle in long bone allometry. We give therefore new insights
into McMahon's constraints and report on the first observation of the
critical-elastic-force, bending-deformation, muscle-induced mechanism that
underlies the allometric law with estimated $\lambda =0.80\pm 0.3$. This
mechanism governs the bone-size evolution with avoiding skeletal fracture
caused by muscle-induced peak stresses and is expected to be unique for small
and large mammals.

formalism utilizes geometric probability techniques to calculate the average
scalar products of random vectors generated in geometric objects, such as
circles and spheres. We show that these average scalar products define a family
of geometric constants which can be used to evaluate the quality of random
number generators. We explicitly apply the GRIP tests to several random number
generators frequently used in Monte Carlo simulations, and demonstrate a new
statistical property for good random number generators.

is discussed in view of the principle of duality in perturbation theory. The
models we consider are a two-level atom and an ensemble of two-level atoms both
interacting with a single radiation mode. The aim is to see how the latter can
be actually used as an amplifier of quantum fluctuations to the classical level
through the thermodynamic limit of a very large ensemble of two-level atoms [M.
Frasca, Phys. Lett. A {\bf 283}, 271 (2001)] and how can remove Schr\""odinger
cat states. The thermodynamic limit can be very effective for producing both
classical states and decoherence on a quantum system that evolves without
dissipation. Decoherence without dissipation is indeed an effect of a single
two-level atom interacting with an ensemble of two-level atoms, a situation
that proves to be useful to understand recent experiments on nanoscale devices
showing unexpected disappearance of quantum coherence at very low temperatures.
