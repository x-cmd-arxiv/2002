  for publication in 20 Dec 2002 ApJ","Astrophys.J.581:1019-1031,2002","10.1086/344301",,"astro-ph",,"  I present results on the correlation between galaxy mass, luminosity, and
metallicity for a sample of spiral and irregular galaxies having well-measured
abundance profiles, distances, and rotation speeds. Additional data for low
surface brightness galaxies from the literature are also included for
comparison. These data are combined to study the metallicity-luminosity and
metallicity-rotation speed correlations for spiral and irregular galaxies. The
metallicity luminosity correlation shows its familiar form for these galaxies,
a roughly uniform change in the average present-day O/H abundance of about a
factor 100 over 11 magnitudes in B luminosity. However, the O/H - V(rot)
relation shows a change in slope at a rotation speed of about 125 km/sec. At
faster V(rot), there appears to be no relation between average metallicity and
rotation speed. At lower V(rot), the metallicity correlates with rotation
speed. This change in behavior could be the result of increasing loss of metals
from the smaller galaxies in supernova-driven winds. This idea is tested by
looking at the variation in effective yield, derived from observed abundances
and gas fractions assuming closed box chemical evolution. The effective yields
derived for spiral and irregular galaxies increase by a factor of 10-20 from
V(rot) approximately 5 km/sec to V(rot) approximately 300 km/sec, asympotically
increasing to approximately constant y(eff) for V(rot) > 150 km/sec. The trend
suggests that galaxies with V(rot) < 100-150 km/sec may lose a large fraction
of their SN ejecta, while galaxies above this value tend to retain metals.

rate, the metallicity evolution and the reddening properties of galaxies based
on their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). This approach allows us to
clarify the level of information present in the data, depending on its
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). When low resolution SEDs are available in the
ultraviolet, optical and near-IR wavelength ranges together, we conclude that
it is possible to constrain the star formation rate and the effective dust
optical depth simultaneously with a signal-to-noise ratio of 25. With excellent
signal-to-noise ratios, the age-metallicity relation can also be constrained.
We apply this method to the well-known nuclear starburst in the interacting
galaxy NGC 7714. We focus on deriving the SFR and the reddening law. We confirm
that classical extinction models cannot provide an acceptable simultaneous fit
of the SED and the lines. We also confirm that, with the adopted population
synthesis models and in addition to the current starburst, an episode of
enhanced star formation that started more than 200 Myr ago is required. As the
time elapsed since the last interaction with NGC 7715, based on dynamical
studies, is about 100 Myr, our result reinforces the suggestion that this
interaction might not have been the most important event in the life of NGC
7714.

spectral properties and the pulse profile shape. The absorbed power law
spectral model gave a photon index of ~ 1.7 and N_H ~ 2.3 x 10^22 cm^-2. These
values explain both a) the ROSAT non-detection and b) the deviant estimate of a
photon index of ~ 0.8 obtained by ASCA. The pulse profile appears, for the
first time, clearly double peaked with the main component much stronger than
the other. The statistical significance is 10 sigma (main peak) and 5 sigma
(secondary peak). The 1.6-10 keV pulsed fraction is consistent with 100%; only
in the 1.6-4 keV band there is a ~ 2 sigma indication for a DC component. The
secondary peak is detected significantly only for energies above 3 / 4 keV. The
unabsorbed (2-10 keV) flux is F_2-10 = 3.7 x 10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1, implying a

continues to change significantly during the other two observations. This
suggests that we are observing, for the first time, a it substantial and

converting Poynting energy flux to particle-borne energy flux in a pulsar wind
- was proposed several years ago by Coroniti and Michel who considered a
particular prescription for magnetic reconnection in a striped wind. This
prescription was later shown to be ineffective. In this paper, we discuss the
basic microphysics of the reconnection process and conclude that a more rapid
prescription is permissible. Assuming dissipation to set in at some distance
outside the light-cylinder, we compute the resulting radiation signature and
find that the synchrotron emission of heated particles appears periodic, in
general showing both a pulse and an interpulse. The predicted spacing of these
agrees well with observation in the case of the Crab and Vela pulsars. Using
parameters appropriate for the Crab pulsar - magnetization parameter at the
light cylinder sigma_L = 6 x 10^4, Lorentz factor Gamma=250 - reasonable
agreement is found with the observed total pulsed luminosity. This suggest that
the high-energy pulses from young pulsars originate not in the co-rotating
magnetosphere within the light cylinder (as in all other models) but from the
radially directed wind well outside it.

feature can be built either by 3D families associated with 3D bifurcations of
the x1 family, or, in some models, even by families related with the z-axis
orbits and existing over large energy intervals. The {\sf `X'} feature observed
inside the boxy bulges of several edge-on galaxies can be attributed to the
peaks of successive x1v1 orbits (Skokos et al. 2002a, hereafter paper I),
provided their stability allows it. However in general, the x1v1 family has to
overcome the obstacle of a S\ar\D\ar S transition in order to support the
structure of a b/p feature. Other families that can be the backbones of b/p
features are x1v4 and z3.1s. The morphology and the size of the boxy or
peanut-shaped structures we find in our models is determined by the presence

favours the idea that the observed edge-on profiles are the imprints of
families of periodic orbits that can be found in appropriately chosen

finite tension. The configuration of a vortex line in equilibrium comprises a
number of pinned straight lengths separated by unpinned kinks when the rotation
axis is slightly inclined to the major axis of a crystal lattice and the Magnus
force is not so strong. Energy of ~ 4 MeV is required to form a kink at

parabolic on global scale. There exist two modes, rotational and helical

  Proceedings are available as MPE-Report 278",,,"MPE-Report 278","astro-ph",,"  The problem of formation of the inner vacuum gap in neutron stars with
${\bf\Omega}\cdot{\bf B}<0$ is considered. It is argued by means of the
condition $T_i/T_s>1$, where $T_i$ is the melting temperature of surface
$^{56}_{26}$Fe ions and $T_s$ is the actual temperature of the polar cap
surface, that the inner vacuum gap can form, provided that the actual surface
magnetic field is extremaly strong ($B_s\gtrsim 10^{13}$ G) and curved (${\cal
R}<10^6$ cm), irrespective of the value of dipolar component measured from the
pulsar spin down rate. The calculations are carried out for pulsars with
drifting subpulses and/or periodic intensity modulations, in which the
existence of the quasi steady vacuum gap discharging via ${\bf E}\times{\bf B}$
drifting sparks is almost unavoidable.

ages 10^6-10^10 yr. We present surface brightness profiles for the entire
sample, and derive structural parameters for each cluster, including core
radii, and luminosity and mass estimates. Because we expect the results
presented here to form the basis for several further projects, we describe in
detail the data reduction and surface brightness profile construction
processes, and compare our results with those of previous ground-based studies.
The surface brightness profiles show a large amount of detail, including
irregularities in the profiles of young clusters (such as bumps, dips, and
sharp shoulders), and evidence for both double clusters and post core-collapse
(PCC) clusters. In particular we find power-law profiles in the inner regions
of several candidate PCC clusters, with slopes of approximately -0.7, but
showing considerable variation. We estimate that 20 +/- 7 % of the old cluster
population of the LMC has entered PCC evolution, a similar fraction to that for
the Galactic globular cluster system. In addition, we examine the profile of
R136 in detail and show that it is probably not a PCC cluster. We also observe
a trend in core radius with age that has been discovered and discussed in
several previous publications by different authors. Our diagram has better
resolution however, and appears to show a bifurcation at several hundred Myr.
We argue that this observed relationship reflects true physical evolution in
LMC clusters, with some experiencing small scale core expansion due to mass
loss, and others large scale expansion due to some unidentified characteristic
or physical process.

evolutionary stages; in turn hydrogen molecules (H2) are produced more
efficiently on dust grains. Therefore, dust can drastically accelerate H2
formation, leading to an enhancement of star formation activity. In order to
examine the first formation of stars and dust in galaxies, we model the
evolution of galaxies in the redshift range of 5<z<20. In particular, we focus
on the interplay between dust formation in Type II supernova ejecta and H2
production on dust grains. Such effect causes an enhancement of star formation
rate by an order of magnitude on a timescale (~3--5 galactic dynamical times)
shorter than the Hubble timescale. We also find that about half of the
radiative energy from stars is reprocessed by dust grains and is finally
radiated in the far infrared (FIR). Typical star formation rates and
luminosities (FIR, UV and metal-line luminosities) are calculated for a large
set of (M_vir, z_vir). Using these results and the Press-Schechter formalism,
we calculate galaxy number counts and integrated light from high-redshift (z>5)
galaxies in sub-millimetre and near-infrared bands. We find that: i) ALMA can
detect dust emission from several thousands of galaxies per square degree, and
ii) NGST can detect the stellar emission from 10^6 galaxies per square degree.
Further observational checks of our predictions include the integrated flux of
metal (oxygen and carbon) lines. We finally discuss possible color selection
strategies for high-redshift galaxy searches.

conductors. For non-interacting particles injected from thermal sources there
is a simple connection between the sign of correlations and statistics:
current-current correlations of Fermions are negative, intensity-intensity
correlations of Bosons can be positive. In contrast to photons, electrons are
interacting entities, and we can expect the simple connection between
statistics and the sign of current-current correlations to be broken, if
interactions play a crucial role. We present a number of examples in which
interactions are important. At a voltage probe the potential fluctuates to
maintain zero current. It is shown that there are geometries for which these
fluctuations lead to positive correlations. Displacement currents at
capacitively coupled contacts are also positively correlated if both contacts
contribute to screening of the same excess charge fluctuation. Hybrid normal
superconducting systems provide another example which permits positive
correlations. The conditions for positive correlations differ strongly
depending on whether the normal conductor is open and well coupled to the
superconductor or is only weakly coupled via a barrier to the superconductor.
In latter case, positive correlations result if the partition noise generated
by Cooper pairs is overcome by pairs which are broken up and emit one electron

the case of a nonrelativistic electron in interaction with a quantized

shows a dependence upon the stochastic terms included in the metric.
Afterwards, we prove, resorting to the influence functional, that the

  the main phenomenological predictions of the model and the other one which
  describes the detailed formulation of the flavor SU(3) chiral quark soliton
  model to predict light-flavor quark and antiquark distribution functions in
  the nucleon",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.67.034005","OU-HEP-416","hep-ph nucl-th",,"  Theoretical predictions are given for the light-flavor sea-quark
distributions including the strange quark ones on the basis of the flavor SU(3)
version of the chiral quark soliton model. Careful account is taken here of the
SU(3) symmetry breaking effects due to the mass difference between the strange
and nonstrange quarks. This effective mass difference $\Delta m_s$ between the
strange and nonstrange quarks is the only one parameter necessary for the
flavor SU(3) generalization of the model. A particular emphasis of study is put
on the {\it light-flavor sea-quark asymmetry} as exemplified by the observables
$\bar{d} (x) - \bar{u} (x), \bar{d} (x) / \bar{u} (x), \Delta \bar{u} (x) -
\Delta \bar{d} (x)$ as well as on the {\it particle-antiparticle asymmetry} of
the strange quark distributions represented by $s (x) - \bar{s} (x), s (x) /
\bar{s} (x), \Delta s (x) - \Delta \bar{s} (x)$ etc. As for the unpolarized
sea-quark distributions, the predictions of the model seem qualitatively
consistent with the available phenomenological information provided by the NMC
data for $\bar{d} (x) - \bar{u} (x)$, the E866 data for $\bar{d} (x) / \bar{u}
(x)$, the CCFR data and Barone et al.'s fit for $s (x) / \bar{s} (x)$ etc. The
model is shown to give several unique predictions also for the spin-dependent
sea-quark distribution, such that $\Delta s (x) \ll \Delta \bar{s}(x) \lesssim
0$ and $\Delta \bar{d}(x) < 0 < \Delta \bar{u}(x)$, although the verification
of these predictions must await more elaborate experimental investigations in
the near future.

provide the nonlinear composition law in any order of dimensionfull deformation
parmeter $\lambda$ (from physical reasons we can put $\lambda = \lambda_{p}$

composition laws for fourmomentum is obtained by nonlinear change of basis in
Poincar\'{e} algebra, which can be performed for any choice of coalgebraic

modification of Hopf algebra scheme with Casimir-dependent deformation
parameter, which can help to resolve the problem of consistent passage to

{\em good determinantal} if it is standard determinantal and a generic complete

sharp. The conjecture is proved for $2\le c\le 5$, and for $c\ge 6$ under some
restriction on $a_0,a_1,...,a_{t+c-2}$ and $b_1,...,b_t$. For questions (2) and

  V2 Abstract: A new mechanism of double-component convection is discovered. It
emerges in a horizontal layer of Boussinesq fluid as a stable stratification
due to flux boundary conditions is added to an unstable gradient specified by
fixed boundary values. Driven by this mechanism, steady finite-amplitude flows
reminiscent of Rayleigh--Benard convection arise even when the background
density stratification is stable.

  Seattle, Washington, USA, July 2002",,"10.1117/12.451791",,"physics.optics",,"  The Phase Diverse Speckle (PDS) problem is formulated mathematically as Multi
Frame Blind Deconvolution (MFBD) together with a set of Linear Equality
Constraints (LECs) on the wavefront expansion parameters. This MFBD-LEC
formulation is quite general and, in addition to PDS, it allows the same code
to handle a variety of different data collection schemes specified as data, the
LECs, rather than in the code. It also relieves us from having to derive new
expressions for the gradient of the wavefront parameter vector for each type of
data set. The idea is first presented with a simple formulation that
accommodates Phase Diversity, Phase Diverse Speckle, and Shack-Hartmann
wavefront sensing. Then various generalizations are discussed, that allows many
other types of data sets to be handled.

Hamiltonians that describe different nonlinear optical processes. The method
exploits the existence of a nonlinear deformation of the usual su(2) algebra
that arises as the dynamical symmetry of the original model. When some physical
parameter, dictated by the process under consideration, becomes small, we
immediately get a diagonal effective Hamiltonian that correctly represents the
dynamics for arbitrary states and long times. We extend the technique to su(3)
and su(N), finding the corresponding effective Hamiltonians when some resonance
conditions are fulfilled.

quantum computation (HQC) is distinguished from the rest in that it is
geometrical in nature and thus expected to be robust against decoherence. Here
we analyze the realization of various quantum gates by solving the inverse
problem: Given a unitary matrix, we develop a formalism by which we find loops
in the parameter space generating this matrix as a holonomy. We demonstrate for
the first time that such a one-qubit gate as the Hadamard gate and such
two-qubit gates as the CNOT gate, the SWAP gate and the discrete Fourier
transformation can be obtained with a single loop.

strength $\lambda$ of the decoherence. We also relate $\lambda$ to an effective
decoherence parameter $\zeta$ considered previously in literature. Finally we
discuss our model in the light of different measures of entanglement, i.e. the
von Neumann entropy $S$, the entanglement of formation $E$ and the concurrence
$C$, and we relate the decoherence parameter $\zeta$ to the loss of
entanglement: $1 - E$.

resonant tunneling) and the resonant frequency on the number of barriers
crossed, which can be directly tested in photonic experiments. A thorough
analysis of the role played by inter-barrier multiple reflections and a
physical interpretation of the results obtained is reported, showing that
multibarrier tunneling is a highly non-local phenomenon.
