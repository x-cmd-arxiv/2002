comprised of 36 large format fully-depleted n-type CCD's sharing a focal plane
with 36 HgCdTe detectors forms the heart of SNAP, allowing discovery and
lightcurve measurements simultaneously for many supernovae. The imager and a
high-efficiency low-resolution integral field spectrograph are coupled to a 2-m
three mirror anastigmat wide-field telescope, which will be placed in a
high-earth orbit. The SNAP mission can obtain high-signal-to-noise calibrated
light-curves and spectra for over 2000 Type Ia supernovae at redshifts between
z=0.1 and 1.7. The resulting data set can not only determine the amount of dark
energy with high precision, but test the nature of the dark energy by examining
its equation of state. In particular, dark energy due to a cosmological
constant can be differentiated from alternatives such as ""quintessence"", by
measuring the dark energy's equation of state to an accuracy of +/-0.05, and by
studying its time dependence.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.06104.x",,"astro-ph",,"  In an attempt to reconcile recent spectral data with predictions of the
standard cooling flow model, it has been suggested that the metals in the
intracluster medium (ICM) might be distributed inhomogeneously on small scales.
We investigate the possible consequences of such a situation within the
framework of the cooling flow scenario. Using the standard isobaric cooling
flow model, we study the ability of such metallicity variations to
preferentially suppress low-temperature line emission in cooling flow spectra.
We then use simple numerical simulations to investigate the temporal and
spatial evolution of the ICM when the metals are distributed in such a fashion.
Simulated observations are used to study the constraints real data can place on
conditions in the ICM. The difficulty of ruling out abundance variations on
small spatial scales with current observational limits is emphasized. We find
that a bimodal distribution of metals may give rise to interesting effects in
the observed abundance profile, in that apparent abundance gradients with
central abundance drops and off-centre peaks, similar to those seen recently in
some clusters, are produced. Different elements behave in different fashion as
governed by the temperature dependence of their equivalent widths. Our overall
conclusion is that, whilst this process alone seems unlikely to be able to
account for the sharp reduction in low temperature emission lines seen in
current spectral data, a contribution at some level is possible and difficult
to rule out. The possibility of small-scale metallicity variations should be
considered when analysing high resolution cluster X-ray spectra.

50-200 km/s, allowing tests with moderate resolution quasar spectra. The strong
bias of high redshift galaxies towards high density regions imprints a clear
signature on the flux PDF, but the predictions are not sensitive to galaxy
baryon mass or star formation rate, and they are similar for galaxies and for
dark matter halos. The dependence of the flux PDF on galaxy proximity is
sensitive to redshift determination errors, with rms errors of 150-300 km/s
substantially weakening the predicted trends. On larger scales, the mean galaxy
overdensity in a cube of 5 or 10 Mpc/h (comoving) is strongly correlated with
the mean Lya flux decrement on a line of sight through the cube center. The
slope of the correlation is ~3 times steeper for galaxies than for dark matter
as a result of galaxy bias. The predicted large scale correlation is in
qualitative agreement with recently reported observational results. However,
observations also show a drop in absorption in the immediate vicinity of
galaxies, which our models do not predict even if we allow the galaxies or AGNs
within them to be ionizing sources. This decreased absorption could be a
signature of galaxy feedback on the surrounding IGM, perhaps via galactic
winds. Peculiar velocities often allow gas at comoving distances ~1.5 Mpc/h to
produce saturated absorption at the galaxy redshift, so any feedback mechanism
must suppress neutral hydrogen out to these radii to match the data. (Abridged)

medium-resolution (FWHM = 20 km/s) FUSE spectra of O VI. We find evidence for
three distinct types of highly ionized gas present in the data. First, two
narrow absorption components are resolved in the Si IV and C IV profiles, at
approximate LSR velocities of -36 and -10 km/s. These narrow components appear
to be produced in gas associated with the Norma and Sagittarius spiral arms, at
approximate z-distances of -1.0 and -0.5 kpc, respectively. Second, we detect
an intermediate-width component in C IV and Si IV, at 17 km/s, which we propose
could arise at the conductive interface at the boundary between a low column
density neutral or weakly ionized cloud and the surrounding hot medium.
Finally, a broad collisionally ionized component of gas responsible for
producing the smooth N V and O VI profiles is observed; such absorption is also
present to a lesser degree in the profiles of Si IV and C IV. The broad O VI
absorption is observed at a velocity displaced from the broad C IV component by
almost 20 km/s, an amount large enough to suggest that the two ions may not
co-exist in the same physical location.

smaller-angular-scale CMB anisotropy data sets used in the analyses, but more
significantly a consequence of whether the DMR quadrupole moment is accounted
for or ignored in the analysis. For both flat-Lambda and open models, after
marginalizing over all other parameters, a lower Omega_B h^2 \simeq
0.005--0.009 is favored. This is also marginally at odds with estimates from
more recent CMB anisotropy data and some estimates from standard
nucleosynthesis theory and observed light element abundances. For both sets of

with other recent non-CMB indicators. We emphasize that since we consider only

electron-positron and electron-proton outflows are considered within the
one-fluid approximation for quasi-monopole cold outflow. It is shown that for a
Poynting-dominated case the drag force does not change the particle energy
inside the fast magnetosonic surface. In this region the action of the drag
results in a diminishing of the Poynting flux, not the particle flux. Outside
the fast magnetosonic surface, for intermediate photon density the drag force
may result in additional acceleration of the plasma. This acceleration is a
result of the disturbance of magnetic surfaces under the action of the drag. At
even larger distances particles are not frozen into the magnetic field and the
drag force decelerates them efficiently.
  In the case of extreme photon densities, the disturbance of magnetic surfaces
becomes large and the drag force changes the total energy flux significantly,
the particles becoming nonrelativistic.
  We find that for Active Galactic Nuclei the photon density is too low to
disturb the parameters of an ideal MHD outflow. The drag action may result in
additional acceleration of outgoing plasma only for central engines with very

jets formed in the course of the collapse of a massive progenitor. Our
numerical simulations show the presence of a strong shear in the bulk velocity
of such jets. This shear can be responsible for a very rapid shear--driven
instability that arises for any velocity profile. This conclusion has been
confirmed both by numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. The
instability leads to rapid fluctuations of the main hydrodynamical parameters
(density, pressure, Lorentz factor, etc.). However, the perturbations of the
density are effectively decoupled from those of the pressure because the beam
of the jet is radiation--dominated. The characteristic growth time of
instability is much shorter than the life time of the jet and, therefore, may
lead to a complete turbulent beam. In the course of the non-linear evolution,
these fluctuations may yield to internal shocks which can be randomly
distributed in the jet. In the case that internal shocks in a ultrarelativistic
outflow are responsible for the observed phenomenology of gamma-ray bursts, the
proposed instability can well account for the short-term variability of
gamma-ray light curves down to milliseconds.

that in order for the peak energy of the synchrotron to be E_p\sim 300 keV with
a variability time t_v>1 ms, a Lorentz factor \Gamma<350 is needed, implying no
HE emission above \sim 30 MeV and the synchrotron component would dominate at
all energies. If we want both E_p\sim 300 keV and prompt HE emission up to 2
GeV, as detected by EGRET for GRB 940217, we need \Gamma\sim 600 and t_v\sim
0.1 ms, which might be resolved by super AGILE. If such prompt HE emission is
common in GRBs, as may be tested by GLAST, then for t_v\gtrsim 1 ms we need
\Gamma\gtrsim 350, which implies E_p\lesssim 100 keV. Therefore if X-ray
flashes are GRBs with high values of t_v and \Gamma, they should produce
\gtrsim 1 GeV emission. For an electron power law index p>2, the SSC component
dominates the emission above 100 MeV. Future observations by GLAST may help
determine the value of p and whether the HE emission is consistent with a
single power law (one component--the synchrotron, dominates) or has a break
where the \nuF_\nu slope turns from negative to positive, implying that the SSC
component becomes dominant above \sim 100 MeV. The HE emission is expected to
show similar variability and time structure to that of the soft gamma-ray
emission. Finally, we find that in order to see delayed HE emission from the
prompt GRB due to pair production with the cosmic IR background, extremely
small intergalactic magnetic fields (\lessim 10^{-22} G) are required.

cases. In the first one the mass of the secondary is 8 M_s, whereas in the
second one the mass was assumed to be 1 M_s. For the first of those cases we
have also explored the possible outcomes of both conservative and
non-conservative mass-loss episodes. During the first mass transfer episode,
several differences arise between the models. The system with the more extreme
mass ratio is not able to survive the 1st. Roche lobe overflow, and spiral-in
of the secondary onto the envelope of the primary is most likely. The system
formed by two stars of comparable mass undergoes two mass transfer episodes in
which the primary is the donor. We have performed two sets of calculations
corresponding to this case in order to account for conservative and
non-conservative mass transfer during the first mass loss episode. One of our
main results is that for the non-conservative case the secondary becomes a
Super-AGB. Such a star undergoes a final dredge-up episode, similar to that of
a single star of comparable mass. The primary components do not undergo a
Super-AGB phase, but instead a carbon-oxygen white dwarf is formed in both
cases, before reversal mass transfer occurs. However, given the extreme mass
ratios at this stage between the components of the binary system, the
possibility of merger episodes remains likely. We also discuss the presumable
final outcomes of the system and possible observational counterparts.

Depending on collision parameters the result could be either a `mixed' or a
`separated' Mott-insulator phase. Such a `mixed' two-species insulator could
then be photo-associated into an array of dipolar molecules suitable for
quantum computation or the formation of a dipolar molecular condensate. For the
case of a $^{87}$Rb-$^{41}$K two-species BEC, however, the large inter-species

difficult. To overcome this difficulty we investigate the effect of varying the

regime under which a lattice of dipolar molecules could be generated.

propositional satisfiability. Rather than algorithms, they are families of
algorithms, as their behavior depend on some choices they face during
execution: DPLL depends on the choice of the literal to branch on; resolution
depends on the choice of the pair of clauses to resolve at each step. The
complexity of making the optimal choice is analyzed in this paper. Extending
previous results, we prove that choosing the optimal literal to branch on in
DPLL is Delta[log]^2-hard, and becomes NP^PP-hard if branching is only allowed
on a subset of variables. Optimal choice in regular resolution is both NP-hard
and CoNP-hard. The problem of determining the size of the optimal proofs is
also analyzed: it is CoNP-hard for DPLL, and Delta[log]^2-hard if a conjecture
we make is true. This problem is CoNP-hard for regular resolution.

the Ashtekar-Barbero connection and we loop-quantize the theory showing that it

the SU(2) Casimir. This covariant point of view allows to analyze closely the
drawbacks of the SU(2) formalism: the quantization based on the (generalized)

depend non-trivially on the embedding of the canonical hypersurface into the
space-time manifold. On the other hand, there exists a true space-time
connection, transforming properly under all diffeomorphisms. We argue that it
is this connection that should be used in the definition of loop variables.
However, we are still not able to complete the quantization program for this

do not see the same geometry at the horizon, as in a 4-dimensional space-time.
Kaluza-Klein modes invades the brane and surroundings and the brane fields can
be considered as a thermal system at the temperature of the black hole. From
energy and entropy consideration, we show that whether or not a six-dimensional
black hole will decay by emitting Kaluza-Klein modes or the standard model
particles, will depend on the length scale of the extra dimensions as well as
on the mass of the black hole. For higher dimensional black holes, Kaluza-Klein
modes will dominate the decay.

consistently modified in the infrared to eliminate, in a radiatively stable
manner, tadpole instabilities that arise after supersymmetry breaking. This is
achieved by deforming the propagators of classically massless scalar fields and
the graviton so as to cancel the contribution of their zero modes. In string
theory, this modification of propagators is accomplished by perturbatively
deforming the world-sheet action with bi-local operators similar to those that
arise in double-trace deformations of AdS/CFT. This results in a perturbatively
finite and unitary S-matrix (in the case of string theory, this claim depends
on standard assumptions about unitarity in covariant string diagrammatics). The
S-matrix is parameterized by arbitrary scalar VEVs, which exacerbates the
vacuum degeneracy problem. However, for generic values of these parameters,
quantum effects produce masses for the nonzero modes of the scalars, lifting
the fluctuating components of the moduli. Warning: in the case of string
theory, the simple prescription discussed in this paper fails to decouple BRST
trivial modes from the physical S-matrix. A procedure aimed at correcting this
is under investigation.

scenaria are unaffected, as they involve shorter length scales. A new
possibility emerges that inflation may ``self-terminate'' naturally by its own
action of stretching wavelengths to enormous sizes. In a simple limit our
proposal leads to a modification of Einstein's equation by a single additional
term proportional to the average space-time curvature of the Universe. It may
also have a qualitative connection with the dS/CFT conjecture.

nonzero Poynting vector can be viewed as expanded FD strings. A fundamental
string is viewed as a collapsed D3-brane and mapped to the (n,m) strings via
electric-magnetic duality rotations. This mapping is the same as a weak-strong
duality transformation and therefore reveals the equivalence of the
electric-magnetic and weak-strong dualities.

the fuzzy two-sphere which yields a unitary representation. This is done by
constructing a star product, $\star_{\lambda}$, for an arbitrary representation
of SU(2) which depends on a continuous parameter $\lambda$ and searching for
the values of $\lambda$ which give unitary representations. We will find two
series of values: $\lambda = \lambda^{(A)}_j=1/(2j)$ and
$\lambda=\lambda^{(B)}_j =-1/(2j+2)$, where j is the spin of the representation
of SU(2). At $\lambda = \lambda^{(A)}_j$ the new star product $\star_{\lambda}$
has poles. To avoid the singularity the functions on the sphere must be
spherical harmonics of order $\ell \leq 2j$ and then $\star_{\lambda}$ reduces
to the star product $\star$ obtained by Preusnajder. The star product at
$\lambda=\lambda^{(B)}_j$, to be denoted by $\bullet$, is new. In this case the
functions on the fuzzy sphere do not need to be spherical harmonics of order
$\ell \leq 2j$. Because in this case there is no cutoff on the order of
spherical harmonics, the degrees of freedom of the gauge fields on the fuzzy
sphere coincide with those on the commutative sphere. Therefore, although the
field theory on the fuzzy sphere is a system with finite degrees of freedom, we
can expect the existence of the Seiberg-Witten map between the noncommutative
and commutative descriptions of the gauge theory on the sphere. We will derive
the first few terms of the Seiberg-Witten map for the U(1) gauge theory on the
fuzzy sphere by using power expansion around the commutative point $\lambda=0$.

corrects the Smagorinsky model near the walls while at the same time minimizing

paper we define what a filter is and also address an issue related to filters;
the error that results when the filtering and differential operations are
interchanged. This error is studied under the context of the Finite Element
Method which allows us to focus on the function being filtered rather than the

synaptic inputs originating from the network's background activity. This leads
to ongoing, mostly subthreshold membrane dynamics that depends on the
statistics of the background activity and of the synapses made on a neuron.
Subthreshold membrane polarization is, in turn, a potent modulator of neural
responses. The present paper analyzes the subthreshold dynamics of the neural
membrane potential driven by synaptic inputs of stationary statistics. Synaptic
inputs are considered in linear interaction. The analysis identifies regimes of
input statistics which give rise to stationary, fluctuating, oscillatory, and
unstable dynamics. In particular, I show that (i) mere noise inputs can drive
the membrane potential into sustained, quasiperiodic oscillations (noise-driven
oscillations), in the absence of a stimulus-derived, intraneural, or network
pacemaker; (ii) adding hyperpolarizing to depolarizing synaptic input can
increase neural activity (hyperpolarization-induced activity), in the absence
of hyperpolarization-activated currents.

single system of qubits amenable to projective measurements. However, in
expectation value quantum computation, such as nuclear magnetic resonance
realizations, the computer consists of an ensemble of identical qubit-systems
amenable only to expectation value measurements. The prevalent strategy in such
expectation value implementations of quantum algorithms has been to retain the
conventional formulation's unitary operations but modify its initialization and
measurement steps appropriately. This naive approach is not optimal for
Grover's algorithm and a shortened version for expectation value quantum
computers is presented.

  revtex4 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Mayers, Lo and Chau argued that all quantum bit commitment protocols are
insecure, because there is no way to prevent an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
cheating attack. However, Yuen presented some protocols which challenged the
previous impossibility argument. Up to now, it is still debated whether there
exist or not unconditionally secure protocols. In this paper the above
controversy is addressed. For such purpose, a complete classification of all
possible bit commitment protocols is given, including all possible cheating
attacks. Focusing on the simplest class of protocols (non-aborting and with
complete and perfect verification), it is shown how naturally a
game-theoretical situation arises. For these protocols, bounds for the cheating
probabilities are derived, involving the two quantum operations encoding the
bit values and their respective alternate Kraus decompositions. Such bounds are
different from those given in the impossibility proof. The whole classification
and analysis has been carried out using a ""finite open system"" approach. The
discrepancy with the impossibility proof is explained on the basis of the
implicit adoption of a ""closed system approach""--equivalent to modeling the
commitment as performed by two fixed machines interacting unitarily in a
overall ""closed system""--according to which it is possible to assume as ""openly
known"" both the initial state and the probability distributions for all secret
parameters, which can be then ""purified"". This approach is also motivated by
existence of unitary extensions for any open system. However, it is shown that
the closed system approach for the classification of commitment protocols
unavoidably leads to infinite dimensions, which then invalidate the continuity
argument at the basis of the impossibility proof.
