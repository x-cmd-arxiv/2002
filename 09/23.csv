  Athanassoula, A. Bosma & R. Mujica",,,,"astro-ph",,"  I follow a bar from its formation, via its evolution, to its destruction and,
perhaps, regeneration. I discuss the main features at each stage and
particularly the role of the halo. Bars can form even in sub-maximum discs. In
fact, such bars can be stronger than bars which have grown in maximum discs.
This is due to the response of the halo and, in particular, to the exchange of
energy and angular momentum between the disc particles constituting the bar and
the halo particles at resonance with it. The bar slowdown depends on the
initial central concentration of the halo and the initial value of the disc Q.
Contrary to the halo mass distribution, the disc changes its radial density
profile considerably during the evolution. Applying the Sackett criterion, I
thus find that discs become maximum in many simulations in which they have
started off as sub-maximum. I briefly discuss the evolution if a gaseous
component is present, as well as the destruction and regeneration of bars.

the newtonian limit has a logarithmic potential. It also can be solved in terms
of a conformal factor. In particular it has solutions which are conformal to

model with $\Omega_m^0 \approx 0.3$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}^0 \approx 0.7$, and $w

the cosmological $\Lambda$ component and for the particular form of the energy
transfer between this dark energy and matter. This gives a strong motive for a
systematic study of general properties of two-fluid FLRW models. We consider a
combination of one perfect fluid, which is quintessence with negative pressure
($p_Q = w\epsilon_Q$), and another perfect fluid, which is a mixture of
radiation and/or matter components with positive pressure ($p = \beta
\epsilon_m$), which define the associated one-fluid model ($p = \gamma
\epsilon$). We introduce a useful classification which contains 4 classes of
models defined by the presence or absence of energy transfer and by the
stationarity ($w = const.$ and $\beta = const.$) or/and non stationarity ($w$
or $\beta$ time dependent) of the equations of state. It is shown that, for
given $w$ and $\beta$, the energy transfer defines $\gamma$ and, therefore, the
total gravitating mass and dynamics of the model. We study important examples
of two-fluid FLRW models within the new classification. The behaviour of the
energy content, gravitating mass, pressure, and the energy transfer are given
as functions of the scale factor. We point out three characteristic scales,
$a_E$, $a_{\cal P}$ and $a_{\cal M}$, which separate periods of time in which
quintessence energy, pressure and gravitating mass dominate. Each sequence of
the scales defines one of 6 evolution types.

about $0.02\sim0.03$ for a given range of photometric uncertainty of $0.05 \sim

Timing Explorer over about a month. We fit the power density spectra using
multiple Lorentzians. We show that the characteristic frequencies of these
Lorentzians, when properly identified, fit within the correlations previously
reported. The time evolution of these frequencies and their relation with the
parameters of the energy spectra reported in Barret & Olive (2002) are used to
constrain the accretion geometry changes. The spectral data were fitted by the
sum of a blackbody and a Comptonized component and were interpreted in the
framework of a truncated accretion disk geometry, with a varying truncation
radius. If one assumes that the characteristic frequencies of the Lorentzians
are some measure of this truncation radius, as in most theoretical models, then
the timing data presented here strengthen the above interpretation. The soft to
hard and hard to soft transitions are clearly associated with the disk receding
from and approaching the neutron star respectively. During the transitions,
correlations are found between the Lorentzian frequencies and the flux and
temperature of the blackbody, which is thus likely to be coming from the disk.
On the other hand, in the hard state, the characteristic Lorentzians
frequencies which are at the lowest, remained nearly constant despite
significant evolution of the spectra parameters. The disk no longer contributes
to the X-ray emission, and the blackbody is now likely to be emitted by the
neutron star surface which is providing the seed photons for the
Comptonization.

the luminosity of the disc is sensitive to its opacity, in contrast to standard
discs powered by release of orbital energy alone. Compared to the latter, our
discs have a broader SED, with a second peak in the near-infrared that is
energetically comparable to the blue bump. The energy in the second peak
increases with the outer radius of the disc, provided that the accretion rate

star formation in normal star-forming galaxies can assume two basic forms: an
``active'', relatively rare, mode characterized by hot dust, suppressed

field; and the more common ``passive'' mode that occurs under more quiescent

perturbations around the unstable state. In this paper, we consider front
propagation in a simple stochastic lattice model. The microscopic picture of
the front dynamics shows that for the description of the far tip of the front,
one has to abandon the idea of a uniformly translating front solution. The
lattice and finite particle effects lead to a ``halt-and-go'' type dynamics at
the far tip of the front, while the average front behind it ``crosses over'' to
a uniformly translating solution. In this formulation, the effect of
stochasticity on the asymptotic front speed is coded in the probability
distribution of the times required for the advancement of the ``foremost
occupied lattice site''. These probability distributions are obtained by
matching the solution of the far tip with the uniformly translating solution
behind in a mean-field type approximation, and the results for the probability
distributions compare well to the results of stochastic numerical simulations.
This approach allows one to deal with much smaller values of $N$ than it is
required to have the $\ln^{-2}N$ asymptotics to be valid.

magnon-assisted tunneling in a mesoscopic tunnel junction between two
ferromagnetic metals. The thermopower is generated in the course of thermal
equilibration between two baths of magnons, mediated by electrons. For a
junction between two ferromagnets with antiparallel polarizations, the ability
of magnon-assisted tunneling to create thermopower $S_{AP}$ depends on the
difference between the size $\Pi_{\uparrow, \downarrow}$ of the majority and
minority band Fermi surfaces and it is proportional to a temperature dependent
factor $(k_{B}T/\omega_{D})^{3/2}$ where $\omega_{D}$ is the magnon Debye
energy. The latter factor reflects the fractional change in the net
magnetization of the reservoirs due to thermal magnons at temperature $T$
(Bloch's $T^{3/2}$ law). In contrast, the contribution of magnon-assisted
tunneling to the thermopower $S_P$ of a junction with parallel polarizations is
negligible. As the relative polarizations of ferromagnetic layers can be
manipulated by an external magnetic field, a large difference $\Delta S =
S_{AP} - S_P \approx S_{AP} \sim - (k_B/e) f (\Pi_{\uparrow},\Pi_{\downarrow})
(k_BT/\omega_{D})^{3/2}$ results in a magnetothermopower effect. This
magnetothermopower effect becomes giant in the extreme case of a junction
between two half-metallic ferromagnets, $\Delta S \sim - k_B/e$.

under the effect of the field, it appears as Riemannian curvature which in
these frames is other than zero. For realization of this idea the author
bimetric gravitation equations are considered. The spherically - symmetric
solution of the equations in Minkowski space-time does not lead to the physical

contributions arising from D^0-> V gamma->l^+ l^- gamma, with V=rho, omega,
phi. The total SM branching ratio is predicted to be in the range (1-3) x
10^(-9). We also consider contributions coming from MSSM with and without R
parity conservation. Effects from MSSM are significant only for the R-parity
violating case. Such contributions enhance the branching ratio D^0-> mu^+ mu^-
gamma to 0.5 x 10^(-7), based on appropriately allowed values for C_9 and

violating decay of heavy right handed (s)neutrinos. The amount of the asymmetry
depends crucially on their number density. If the (s)neutrinos are generated
thermally, in supersymmetric models there is limited parameter space leading to
enough baryons. For this reason, several alternative mechanisms have been
proposed. We discuss the nonperturbative production of sneutrino quanta by a
direct coupling to the inflaton. This production dominates over the
corresponding creation of neutrinos, and it can easily (i.e. even for a rather
small inflaton-sneutrino coupling) lead to a sufficient baryon asymmetry. We
then study the amplification of MSSM degrees of freedom, via their coupling to
the sneutrinos, during the rescattering phase which follows the nonperturbative
production. This process, which mainly influences the (MSSM) $D-$flat
directions, is very efficient as long as the sneutrinos quanta are in the
relativistic regime. The rapid amplification of the light degrees of freedom
may potentially lead to a gravitino problem. We estimate the gravitino
production by means of a perturbative calculation, discussing the regime in
which we expect it to be reliable.

decreases monotonically as the charge of black branes increases and finally
disappears at the extremal point. For more general cases we found that, when
the coupling parameter is small, black brane solutions become stable even
before reaching to the extremal point. On the other hand, when the coupling
parameter is large, black branes are always unstable and moreover the
instability does not continue to decrease, but starts to increase again as they
approach to the extremal point. However all extremal black branes are shown to
be stable even in this case. It has also been shown that main features of the

basic invariant is always linearizable (this result was first obtained in [M

conditions, we also prove that such a 4-web with a constant basic invariant
(Nakai's web) is linearizable if and only if it is parallelizable. We also
study four classes of the so-called almost parallelizable 4-webs APW_a, a = 1,
2, 3, 4 (for them the curvature K = 0 and the basic invariant is constant on
the leaves of the web foliation X_a), and prove that a 4-web APW_a is
linearizable if and only if it coincides with a 4-web MW_a of the corresponding
special class of 4-webs MW. The existence theorems are proved for all the

for an across-resonance sweep of the magnetic field, a collapsing condensate

for decreasing interaction times--until very short times are reached, and
coherent oscillations between remnant and burst atoms. In particular, the
amplitude of the remnant-burst oscillations, and the corresponding missing
atoms, have prompted speculation as to the formation of a molecular condensate.
Using a minimal mean-field model, we find that rogue dissociation, molecular
dissociation to noncondensate atom pairs, is qualitatively implicated as the
physical mechanism responsible for these observations, although very little
molecular condensate is formed. Refining the model provides excellent
quantitative agreement with the experimental remnant-burst oscillations, and
the fraction of molecular condensate accounts almost entirely for the measured

this reciprocity, there is complete symmetry of the description: Einsteinian
