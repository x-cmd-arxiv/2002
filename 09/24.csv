obtained, manifest in the correlation of the observed ellipticities of
galaxies. Constraints have already been placed on cosmological parameters, such
as the normalisation of the matter power spectrum sigma_8. One possible
systematic contaminant of the lensing correlation signal arises from intrinsic
galaxy alignment, which is still poorly constrained. Unlike lensing, intrinsic
correlations only pertain to galaxies with small physical separations, the
correlation length being a few Mpc. We present a new method that harnesses this
property, and isolates the lensing and intrinsic components of the galaxy
ellipticity correlation function using measurements between different redshift
slices. The observed signal is approximated by a set of template functions,
making no strong assumptions about the amplitude or correlation length of any
intrinsic alignment. We also show that the near-degeneracy between the matter
density parameter Omega_m and sigma_8 can be lifted using correlation function
tomography, even in the presence of an intrinsic alignment signal.

Broad components are observed in 3 to 4 objects. All objects with a broad

obscuration of BLRs and X-ray obscuring column in Seyferts, and interpreted in
a unified AGN scheme, this result can be reconciled with two interpretations.
Either the properties of dust near the AGN are modified towards larger grains,
for example through coagulation, in a way that significantly flattens the
optical/IR extinction curve, or the ratio of dust obscuration to X-ray column
varies for different viewing angles with respect to the axis of symmetry of the
putative torus. Our spectra also provide a survey of emission in the [SiIX]

gravitational lensing by intervening large-scale structures. We construct
all-sky maximum-likelihood estimators that use the lensing effect to estimate
the projected density (convergence) of these structures, its power spectrum,
and cross-correlation with other observables. This contrasts with earlier
quadratic-estimator approaches that Taylor-expanded the observed CMB
temperature to linear order in the lensing deflection angle; these approaches
gave estimators for the temperature-convergence correlation in terms of the CMB
three-point correlation function and for the convergence power spectrum in
terms of the CMB four-point correlation function, which can be biased and
non-optimal due to terms beyond the linear order. We show that for sufficiently
weak lensing, the maximum-likelihood estimator reduces to the computationally
less demanding quadratic estimator. The maximum likelihood and quadratic
approaches are compared by evaluating the root-mean-square (RMS) error and bias
in the reconstructed convergence map in a numerical simulation; it is found
that both the RMS errors and bias are of order 1 percent for the case of Planck
and of order 10--20 percent for a 1 arcminute beam experiment. We conclude that
for recovering lensing information from temperature data acquired by these

Bolometer Array on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope have faced an

propose a new method to identify such submillimeter sources with a mid-infrared
image having a finer point spread function. The Infrared Space Observatory has
provided a very deep 6.7 um image of the Hawaii Deep Field SSA13. All three
faint 850 um sources in this field have their 6.7 um counterparts. They have
been identified with interacting galaxy pairs in optical images. These pairs
are also detected in the radio. Two of them are optically faint and very red
(I>24, I-K>4), one of which has a hard X-ray detection with the Chandra
satellite. As these observing properties are similar to those of local
ultraluminous infrared galaxies, their photometric redshifts are derived based
on submillimeter to mid-infrared flux ratios assuming a spectral energy
distribution (SED) of Arp220. Other photometric redshifts are obtained via
chi^2 minimization between the available photometry data and template SEDs.
Both estimates are in the range z=1-2, in good agreement with a spectroscopic
redshift and a millimetric one. The reconstructed Arp220 SEDs with these
redshift estimates are consistent with all the photometry data except Chandra's
hard X-ray detection. The sources would be a few times more luminous than
Arp220. With an assumption that AGN contributions are negligible, it appears
that extremely high star formation rates are occurring in galaxies at high
redshifts with massive stellar contents already in place.

data pipelines from the time-ordered raw visibility samples to the CMB power
spectra which utilize the methods of data compression, maximum likelihood
analysis, and optimal subspace filtering. They are customized for three
observational strategies, such as the single pointing, the mosaicking, and the
drift-scanning. For each strategy, derived are the optimal strategy parameters
that yield band power estimates with minimum uncertainty. The results are
general and can be applied to any close-packed array on a single platform such
as the CBI and the forthcoming AMiBA experiments. We have also studied the
effect of rotation of the array platform on the band power correlation by
simulating the CBI single pointing observation. It is found that the band power
anti-correlations can be reduced by rotating the platform and thus densely
sampling the visibility plane. This enables us to increase the resolution of
the power spectrum in the l-space down to the limit of the sampling theorem
(Delta l = 226 = pi / theta), which is narrower by a factor of about sqrt{2}
than the resolution limit (Delta l = 300) used in the recent CBI single
pointing observation. The validity of this idea is demonstrated for a
two-element interferometer that samples visibilities uniformly in the
uv-annulus. From the fact that the visibilities are the Fourier modes of the
CMB field convolved with the beam, a fast unbiased estimator (FUE) of the CMB
power spectra is developed and tested. It is shown that the FUE gives results
very close to those from the quadratic estimator method without requiring large
computer resources even though uncertainties in the results increase.

exhibit both a strong blue-violet continuum and strong H_alpha emission (FWHM
of 70 km/s), whereas Hen 134 and 137 exhibit weak H_alpha emission. The H_alpha
profiles are typical of non-dusty symbiotic stars belonging to class S-3 as
defined by Van Winckel et al. (1993, A&AS 102, 401). In that class as in the
Henize symbiotic S stars, He I, [N II] or [S II] emission lines are absent,
suggesting that the nebular density is high but the excitation rather low. The
radial velocity of the centre of the H_alpha emission is identical to that of
the companion star (at least for Hen 121 where this can be checked from the
available orbital elements), thus suggesting that the H_alpha emission
originates from gas moving with the companion star. For Hen 121, this is
further confirmed by the disappearance of the ultraviolet Balmer continuum when
the companion is eclipsed by the S star. Hen 121 is thus the second eclipsing
binary star discovered among extrinsic S stars (the first one is HD 35155). A
comparison of the available data on orbital periods and H_alpha emission leads
to the conclusion that H_alpha emission in S stars seems to be restricted to
binary systems with periods in the range 600 - 1000 d, in agreement with the
situation prevailing for red symbiotic stars (excluding symbiotic novae).
Symbiotic S stars are found among the most evolved extrinsic S stars.

reprocessing/thermalization of the same hard X-rays. The heating rate of the

to arise both from the quiescent star and accretion shocks at the base of
stellar magnetospheric columns, along which material from the disk accretes.
The accretion flux is calculated self-consistently from the accretion mass loss
rate. We find that the disk cannot be entirely removed using only viscous
evolution and photoionization from the disk-star accretion shock. However, when
FUV photoevaporation by external massive stars is included the disk is removed
in 10^6 -10^7yr; and when EUV photoevaporation by external massive stars is
included the disk is removed in 10^5 - 10^6yr.
  An intriguing feature of photoevaporation by the central star is the
formation of a gap in the disk at late stages of the disk evolution. As the gap
starts forming, viscous spreading and photoevaporation work in resonance.
  There is no gap formation for disks nearby external massive stars because the
outer annuli are quickly removed by the dominant EUV flux. On the other hand,
at larger, more typical distances (d>>0.03pc) from the external stars the flux
is FUV dominated. As a consequence, the disk is efficiently evaporated at two
different locations; forming a gap during the last stages of the disk
evolution.

metastable configuration decreases monotonously with the total spin S, while
the activation energy for the decay of a metastable state has distinct maxima
as a function of S. For specific values of S, the dynamical stability of
spin-polarized ensembles of prismanes appears to be higher than that of an
isolated prismane, pointing to a possibility of existence of ""cluster matter""
composed of spin-polarized clusters C_8

the absorption properties of the hole, with states closer to the hole having
shorter half-lives. As the coupling increases, the spectrum departs from that

Beyond a certain coupling the 1S1/2 state is no longer the ground state, which
shifts to the 2P3/2 state, and then to states of successively greater angular

the approximate size of the extra dimension) should be in the range 600-1200
GeV when the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle (LKP) corresponds to the
hypercharge boson and in the range 1 - 1.8 TeV when it corresponds to a
neutrino. In this article, we compute the elastic scattering cross sections
between Kaluza-Klein dark matter and nuclei both when the lightest Kaluza-Klein
particle is a KK mode of a weak gauge boson, and when it is a neutrino. We
include nuclear form factor effects which are important to take into account
due to the large LKP masses favored by estimates of the relic density. We
present both differential and integrated rates for present and proposed
Germanium, NaI and Xenon detectors. Observable rates at current detectors are
typically less than one event per year, but the next generation of detectors
can probe a significant fraction of the relevant parameter space.

position dependent, $\Lambda_s=\Lambda_s(x_T)$. We compute gluon distributions
both before and after the collisions. The gluon distribution in the nuclear
wavefunction before the collision is significantly suppressed below the
saturation scale when compared to the simple McLerran-Venugopalan model

unchanged. We study the centrality dependence of produced gluons and compare it
to the centrality dependence of charged hadrons exhibited by the RHIC data. We
demonstrate the geometrical scaling property of the initial gluon transverse
momentum distributions for different centralities. Classical Yang-Mills results
for $p_T < \Lambda_s$ are simply matched to perturbative QCD computations for
$p_T > \Lambda_s$-the resulting energy per particle is significantly lower than
the purely classical estimates. Our results for nuclear collisions can be used

possible equilibration of hot and dense gluonic matter produced in heavy ion

the chiral symmetry. It is expected that experimental signatures peculiar to

Building on previous work on time-dependent discrete mechanics, our approach is
based on a discrete version of the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle for
nonautonomous systems.

superposition of thermal and solutal problems, with coupling due to advection
and proportional to the separation parameter S. Many properties of binary fluid
convection are then consequences of generic properties of 2 x 2 matrices. The
eigenvalues of 2 x 2 matrices varying continuously with a parameter r undergo
either avoided crossing or complex coalescence, depending on the sign of the
coupling (product of off-diagonal terms). We first consider the matrix
governing the stability of the conductive state. When the thermal and solutal
gradients act in concert (S>0, avoided crossing), the growth rates of
perturbations remain real and of either thermal or solutal type. In contrast,
when the thermal and solutal gradients are of opposite signs (S<0, complex
coalescence), the growth rates become complex and are of mixed type.
Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of nonlinear steady states is governed by an
eigenvalue problem very similar to that governing the growth rates. There is a
quantitative analogy between the growth rates of the linear stability problem
for infinite Prandtl number and the amplitudes of steady states of the minimal
five-variable Veronis model for arbitrary Prandtl number. For positive S,
avoided crossing leads to a distinction between low-amplitude solutal and
high-amplitude thermal regimes. For negative S, the transition between real and
complex eigenvalues leads to the creation of branches of finite amplitude, i.e.
to saddle-node bifurcations. The codimension-two point at which the saddle-node
bifurcations disappear, separating subcritical from supercritical pitchfork
bifurcations, is exactly analogous to the Bogdanov codimension-two point at
which the Hopf bifurcations disappear in the linear problem.

distributions and compare to experimental data from SIS to SPS energies within
the UrQMD and HSD transport approaches that are both based on string, quark,
diquark ($q, \bar{q}, qq, \bar{q}\bar{q}$) and hadronic degrees of freedom. The
two transport models do not include any explicit phase transition to a
quark-gluon plasma (QGP). It is found that both approaches agree rather well
with each other and with the experimental rapidity distributions for protons,
$\Lambda$'s, $\pi^\pm$ and $K^\pm$. Inspite of this apparent agreement both
transport models fail to reproduce the maximum in the excitation function for
the ratio $K^+/\pi^+$ found experimentally between 11 and 40 A$\cdot$GeV. A
comparison to the various experimental data shows that this 'failure' is
dominantly due to an insufficient description of pion rapidity distributions
rather than missing 'strangeness'. The modest differences in the transport
model results -- on the other hand -- can be attributed to different
implementations of string formation and fragmentation, that are not
sufficiently controlled by experimental data for the 'elementary' reactions in
vacuum.

nuclear charges in the range Z = 50-94. The two-photon rates modify previously
published lifetimes/transition rates of 2 3P0 states. For isotopes with nuclear
spin I not equal 0, where hyperfine quenching dominates the 2 3P0 decay,
two-photon contributions are significant; for example, in heliumlike 187 Os the
two-photon correction is 3% of the total rate. For isotopes with I= 0, where
the 2 3P0 decay is unquenched, the E1M1 corrections are even more important
reaching 60% for Z=94. Therefore, to aid in the interpretation of experiments
on hyperfine quenching in heliumlike ions and to provide a more complete

applying a Cartan decomposition to su(4), we find that the geometric structure

3-Torus. Since different points on the 3-Torus may correspond to the same local
equivalence class, we use the Weyl group theory to reduce the symmetry. We show
that the local equivalence classes of two-qubit gates are in one-to-one
correspondence with the points in a tetrahedron except on the base. We then
study the properties of perfect entanglers, that is, the two-qubit operations
that can generate maximally entangled states from some initially separable
states. We provide criteria to determine whether a given two-qubit gate is a
perfect entangler and establish a geometric description of perfect entanglers
by making use of the tetrahedral representation of non-local gates. We find
that exactly half the non-local gates are perfect entanglers. We also
investigate the non-local operations generated by a given Hamiltonian. We first
study the gates that can be directly generated by a Hamiltonian. Then we
explicitly construct a quantum circuit that contains at most three non-local
gates generated by a two-body interaction Hamiltonian, together with at most
four local gates generated by single qubit terms. We prove that such a quantum
circuit can simulate any arbitrary two-qubit gate exactly, and hence it
provides an efficient implementation of universal quantum computation and

understanding of quantum mechanics. The emphasis is put on the very special
correlations that this theory makes possible: they are forbidden by very
general arguments based on realism and local causality. In fact, these
correlations are completely impossible in any circumstance, except the very
special situations designed by physicists especially to observe these purely
quantum effects. Another general point that is emphasized is the necessity for
the theory to predict the emergence of a single result in a single realization
of an experiment. For this purpose, orthodox quantum mechanics introduces a
special postulate: the reduction of the state vector, which comes in addition
to the Schrodinger evolution postulate. Nevertheless, the presence in parallel
of two evolution processes of the same object (the state vector) maybe a
potential source for conflicts; various attitudes that are possible to avoid
this problem are discussed in this text. After a brief historical introduction,
recalling how the very special status of the state vector has emerged in
quantum mechanics, various conceptual difficulties are introduced and
discussed. The Einstein Podolsky Rosen (EPR) theorem is presented with the help
of a botanical parable, in a way that emphasizes how deeply the EPR reasoning
is rooted into what is often called ""scientific method''. In another section
the GHZ argument, the Hardy impossibilities, as well as the BKS theorem are
introduced in simple terms.

independent of information source, both of the average error and the
probability that the coding rate is greater than the entropy rate $H(rho_p)$,
tend to 0. If $H(rho_p)$ is estimated, we can compress the coding rate to the
admissible rate $H(rho_p)$ with a probability close to 1. However, when we
perform a naive measurement for the estimation of $H(rho_p)$, the input state
is demolished. By smearing the measurement, we successfully treat the trade-off
between the estimation of $H(rho_p)$ and the non-demolition of the input state.
Our protocol can be used not only for the Schumacher's scheme but also for the
compression of entangled states.

string with an exponentially large number of all the strings in certain code
space to find out the closest one. Here we have spotted that, in an
entanglement purification protocol(EPP), the random basis in the state
preparation stage is only necessary to those check qubits, but uncessary to the
code qubits. In our modified two way communication EPP(2-EPP) protocol, Alice
and Bob may first take all the parity checks on $Z$ basis to reduce the bit
flip error to strictly zero with a high probability, e.g., $1-2^{-30}$, and
then use the CSS code to obtain the final key. We show that, this type of 2-EPP
protocol can be reduced to an equivalent prepare and measure protocol. In our
protocol, the huge complexity of decoding the classical CSS code is totally
removed.
