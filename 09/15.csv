  Japan",,"10.1093/pasj/54.6.999",,"astro-ph",,"  We observed the entire course of the 1998 outburst of V592 Her, which was
originally reported as a nova in 1968. We have been able to construct a full
light curve of the outburst, which is characterized by a rapid initial decline
(0.98 mag/d), which smoothly developed into a plateau phase with a slower
linear decline. We detected superhumps characteristic to SU UMa-type dwarf
novae ~7 d after the optical maximum. The overall behavior of the light curve
and the development of superhumps were characteristic to a WZ Sge-type dwarf
nova. Combined with the past literature, we have been able to uniquely
determine the superhump period to be 0.05648(2) d. From this period, together
with a modern interpretation of the absolute magnitude of the outburst light
curve, we conclude that the overall picture of V592 Her is not inconsistent
with a lower main-sequence secondary star in contrast to a previous claim that
V592 Her contains a brown dwarf.

slowly converges to the isotropic value. For a strong disorder the deviation

time. In the case of a two-band superconductor we apply a simplified model of
the interaction independent on momentum within a band. In the framework of this

law, however, tells us little about cats, cannonballs, or economics. This
lecture expands on this theme to address the question of what features of our
world are predicted by a fundamental ``theory of everything'' governing the
regularities exhibited universally by all physical systems. This may consist of
two parts: a dynamical law governing regularities in time (e.g superstring
theory) and a law of cosmological initial condition governing mostly
regularities in space (e.g. Hawking's no-boundary initial condition). The
lecture concludes that: (1) ``A theory of everything'' is not a theory of
everything in a quantum mechanical universe. (2) If the laws are short enough
to be discoverable then they are probably too short to predict everything. (3)
The regularities of human history, economics, biology, geology, etc are
consistent with the fundamental laws of physics but do not follow from them.

ties the deformation of the multiplication of the space algebra to the
deformation of the coproduct of the enveloping algebra. Since the deformation
of the coproduct is governed by a Drinfeld twist, the same twist naturally
defines a covariant star product on the commutative space. However, this
product is in general not associative and does not yield the quantum space. It
is shown that there are certain Drinfeld twists which realize the associative
product of the quantum plane, quantum Euclidean 4-space, and quantum Minkowski
space. These twists are unique up to a central 2-coboundary. The appropriate
formal deformation of real structures of the quantum spaces is also expressed
by these twists.

transition state spectra) that reproduce reasonably well the measured fission
cross section of $^{235}$U from neutron energy of 1 keV to 2 MeV. From these
models we have calculated the fission cross section of the 77 eV isomer of
$^{235}$U over the same energy range. We find that the ratio of the isomer
cross section to that of the ground state lies between about 0.45 and 0.55 at
low neutron energies. The cross sections become approximately equal above 1
MeV. The ratio of the neutron capture cross section to the fission cross
section for the isomer is predicted to be about a factor of 3 larger for the
isomer than for the ground state of $^{235}$U at keV neutron energies. We have
also calculated the cross section for the population of the isomer by inelastic
neutron scattering form the $^{235}$U ground state. We find that the isomer is
strongly populated, and for $E_n = 1 MeV$ the $(n,n'\gamma)$ cross section
leading to the population of the isomer is of the order of 0.5 barn. Thus,
neutron reaction network calculations involving the uranium isotopes in a high
neutron fluence are likely to be affected by the 77 eV isomer of $^{235}$U.
With these same models the fission cross sections of $^{233}$U and $^{237}$U
can be reproduced approximately using only minor adjustments to the barrier
heights. With the significant lowering of the outer barrier that is expected
for the outer barrier the general behavior of the fission cross section of
$^{239}$Pu can also be reproduced.
