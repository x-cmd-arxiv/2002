resolution N-body simulations. This so-called cold dark matter (CDM) crisis has
been addressed in several ways, ranging from a change in fundamental physics by
introducing self-interacting cold dark matter particles to a tuning of complex
astrophysical processes such as global and/or local feedback. All these efforts
attempt to soften density profiles and reduce the abundance of satellites in
simulated galaxy halos. In this contribution we are exploring the differences
between a Warm Dark Matter model and a CDM model where the power on a certain
scale is reduced by introducing a narrow negative feature (''dip''). This dip
is placed in a way so as to mimic the loss of power in the WDM model: both
models have the same integrated power out to the scale where the power of the
Dip model rises to the level of the unperturbed CDM spectrum again. Using
N-body simulations we show that that the new Dip model appears to be a viable
alternative to WDM while being based on different physics: where WDM requires
the introduction of a new particle species the Dip stems from a non-standard
inflationary period. If we are looking for an alternative to the currently
challenged standard LCDM structure formation scenario, neither the LWDM nor the
new Dip model can be ruled out with respect to the analysis presented in this
contribution. They both make very similar predictions and the degeneracy
between them can only be broken with observations yet to come.

objects with a flat or inverted spectrum compact radio core in the VLA survey
of 48 low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) by Nagar et al. (2000). An X-ray nucleus is
detected in all galaxies except one and their X-ray luminosities are in the
range 5x10^38 to 8x10^41 erg/s. The X-ray spectra are generally steeper than
expected from thermal bremsstrahlung emission from an advection-dominated
accretion flow (ADAF). The X-ray to Halpha luminosity ratios for 11 out of 14
objects are in good agreement with the value characteristic of LLAGNs and more
luminous AGNs, and indicate that their optical emission lines are predominantly
powered by a LLAGN. For three objects, this ratio is less than expected.
Comparing with properties in other wavelengths, we find that these three
galaxies are most likely to be heavily obscured AGN. We use the ratio RX = \nu
L\nu (5 GHz)/LX, where LX is the luminosity in the 2-10 keV band, as a measure
of radio loudness. In contrast to the usual definition of radio loudness (RO =
L\nu(5 GHz)/L\nu(B)), RX can be used for heavily obscured (NH >~ 10^23 cm^-2,
AV>50 mag) nuclei. Further, with the high spatial resolution of Chandra, the
nuclear X-ray emission of LLAGNs is often easier to measure than the nuclear
optical emission. We investigate the values of RX for LLAGNs, luminous Seyfert
galaxies, quasars and radio galaxies and confirm the suggestion that a large
fraction of LLAGNs are radio loud.

in the Taurus-Auriga dark cloud where the separations between primaries and
their secondaries are less than the typical size of a circumstellar disk around
a young star. Analysis of low-resolution and medium-resolution STIS spectra
yields the stellar luminosities, reddenings, ages, masses, mass accretion
rates, IR excesses, and emission line luminosities for each star in each pair.
We examine the ability of IR color excesses, H-alpha equivalent widths, [O I]
emission, and veiling to distinguish between weak emission and classical T
Tauri stars. Four pairs have one cTTs and one wTTs; the cTTs is the primary in
three of these systems. This frequency of mixed pairs among the close T Tauri
binaries is similar to the frequency of mixed pairs in wider young binaries.
Extinctions within pairs are usually similar; however, the secondary is more
heavily reddened than the primary in some systems, where it may be viewed
through the primary's disk. Mass accretion rates of primaries and secondaries
are strongly correlated, and H-alpha luminosities, IR excesses, and ages also
correlate within pairs. Primaries tend to have somewhat larger accretion rates
than their secondaries do, and are typically slightly older than their
secondaries according to three different sets of modern pre-main-sequence
evolutionary tracks. Age differences for XZ Tau and FS Tau, systems embedded in
reflection nebulae, are striking; the secondary in each pair is less massive
but more luminous than the primary. The stellar masses of the UY Aur and GG Tau
binaries measured from their rotating molecular disks are about 30% larger than
the masses inferred from the spectra and evolutionary tracks.

new radio data and a simple model for the nature of the depolarizing screen, it

calculated from an early stage, when all solids, assumed to be high-temperature

planetesimals. The simulation of planetary evolution starts with a solid embryo
of ~1 Earth mass, and proceeds according to the core accretion -- gas capture
model. Orbital parameters are kept constant, and it is assumed that the
environment of each planet is not perturbed by the second planet. It is found
that conditions suitable for both planets to form within several Myr are easily
created, and maintained throughout the formation time, in disks with $\alpha
\approx 0.01$. In such disks, a planet of 2.6 Jupiter masses (the minimum for
the inner planet of the 47 UMa system) may be formed at 2.1 AU from the star in

formation of planets is possible as a result of a significant enhancement of
the surface density of solids between 1.0 and 4.0 AU, which results from the
evolution of a disk with an initially uniform gas-to-dust ratio of 167 and an
initial radius of 40 AU.

the ratio of currently formed stars over the stars formed in the past, or
""birthrate"" parameter b. We also determine the ""global gas content"" combining
HI with CO observations. We define the ""gas deficiency"" parameter as the
logarithmic difference between the gas content of isolated galaxies of a given
Hubble type and the measured gas content.For the isolated objects we find that
b decreases with increasing NIR luminosity. The gas-deficient objects,
primarily members to the Virgo cluster, have their birthrate significantly
lower than the isolated objects with normal gas content and of similar NIR
luminosity. This indicates that the current star formation is regulated by the
gaseous content of spirals.Whatever mechanism (most plausibly ram-pressure
stripping) is responsible for the pattern of gas deficiency observed in spiral
galaxies members to rich clusters, it also produces the observed quenching of
the current star formation.

the dust formation scenario after day 465. The [O I] line profile suggests that
the dust occupies a sphere with velocity $\approx 800$ km s$^{-1}$ and optical
depth $\gg10$. The plateau brightness and duration combined with the expansion
velocity suggest a presupernova radius of $120-150 R_{\odot}$, ejecta mass of
$10-11 M_{\odot}$ and explosion energy of $(0.5-1)\times10^{51}$ erg. The
ejecta mass combined with the neutron star and a conservative assumption about
mass loss implies the main sequence progenitor of $M_{\rm ms}\approx 12-14
M_{\odot}$. From the [O I] 6300,6364 \AA doublet luminosity we infer the oxygen
mass to be a factor four lower than in SN 1987A which is consistent with the
estimated SN 1999em progenitor mass . We note a ""second-plateau"" behaviour of
the light curve after the main plateau at the beginning of the radioactive
tail. This feature seems to be common to SNe IIP with low $^{56}$Ni mass.

of the sample showed that their radial velocity dispersion is relatively small

recent formation scenarios. By means of time-resolved UVES spectra, a radial
velocity survey for close companions to the targets was conducted. The radial
velocities of the targets turned out to be rather constant setting upper limits
for the mass Msini of possible companions to 0.1 - 2 M_Jup. These findings hint
at a rather low (<10%) multiplicity fraction of the studied brown dwarfs.
Furthermore, a photometric monitoring campaign of the targets yielded the
determination of rotational periods for three brown dwarf candidates in the
range of 2.2 to 3.4 days. These are the first rotational periods for very young
brown dwarfs and among the first for brown dwarfs at all.

temperature of superconducting transition (Tc) raises up to Tc max=72 K for
x=0.3, 0.4. The hole doping achieved along the series increases with Cu->Ru
substitution. For x different than x=0, Tc can be subsequently tuned between Tc
max and 0 K by changing oxygen content in the compounds. The magnetic
characteristics of the RE=Gd and Eu based compounds are interpreted as
indicative of constrained dimensionality of the superconducting phase. Muon
spin rotation experiments reveal the presence of the magnetic transitions at
low temperatures (Tm=14-2 K for x=0.1-0.4) that can originate in the response
of Ru/Cu sublattices. RuSr2Gd(1-y)Ce(1-y)Cu2O8 (0<y<0.1) compounds show the

spins only with full Matsubara frequency dependence. The zero-frequency
contribution to this action is equivalent to static perturbation theory and
characterizes the stabilty of a given spin configuration, while the component
linear in frequency can be interpreted as the joint Berry phase of the Mn and
carrier system. For simple parabolic-band carriers the collinear ferromagnetic
state with all Mn spins in parallel is always stationary but generically
unstable. This instability can be characterized in terms of inverse
participation ratios and is due to long-ranged nonlocal spin fluctuations. We
also present results for the ground state magnetization as a function of an

matching with ongoing astrophysical observations such as gravitational wave
astronomy. Many trials for longterm stable and accurate simulations of binary
compact objects have revealed that mathematically equivalent sets of evolution
equations show different numerical stability in free evolution schemes. In this
article, we first review the efforts of the community, categorizing them into
the following three directions: (1) modifications of the standard
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner equations initiated by the Kyoto group, (2) rewriting of
the evolution equations in hyperbolic form, and (3) construction of an
""asymptotically constrained"" system. We next introduce our idea for explaining
these evolution behaviors in a unified way using eigenvalue analysis of the
constraint propagation equations. The modifications of (or adjustments to) the
evolution equations change the character of constraint propagation, and several
particular adjustments using constraints are expected to diminish the
constraint-violating modes. We propose several new adjusted evolution
equations, and include some numerical demonstrations. We conclude by discussing
some directions for future research.

spherically symmetric bosonic matter and gravitational field configuration to a
final radiation configuration, corresponding to the relic Hawking radiation
from a non-rotating, chargeless black hole which evaporates completely. This is
obtained via the classical action integral which is solely a boundary term. On
discretising the classical action, the quantum amplitude can be expressed in
terms of generalised coherent states of the harmonic oscillator. A
squeezed-state representation is obtained by complexifying the proper time
separation T at spatial infinity between the initial and final space-like
hypersurfaces. Such a procedure is deemed necessary as the two-surface problem
for Dirichlet boundary data and wave-like perturbations is not well posed. We
find that infinitesimal rotation into the lower complex T plane is equivalent
to a highly-squeezed final state for the relic radiation, similar to the relic
gravitational-wave background in cosmology. This final state is a pure state,
and so the unpredictability associated with the final momentarily-naked
singularity is avoided. The cosmological analogy is the tunnelling from an
initial smooth Euclidean or timeless state to a classical universe. The
high-squeezing limit corresponds to a final state of the Hawking flux which is
indistinguishable from a stochastic collection of standing waves. The phases
conjugate to the field amplitudes are squeezed to discrete values. We also
discuss the entropy of the final radiation in the high-squeezing limit.

dimension turns out to be 2, just as in the usual translation invariant models.
We study the phase structure, critical phenomena and spontaneous symmetry

various boundary conditions. In our simplified models a number of questions can
be answered that remain controversial in the translation invariant models, such
as the asymptoticity of the perturbation expansion and the role of

weakly-coupled gauge theories (such as QCD at asymptotically high temperature
$T$) can be described by an effective kinetic theory, valid on sufficiently
large time and distance scales. The appropriate Boltzmann equations depend on
effective scattering rates for various types of collisions that can occur in
the plasma. The resulting effective kinetic theory may be used to evaluate
observables which are dominantly sensitive to the dynamics of typical
ultrarelativistic excitations. This includes transport coefficients
(viscosities and diffusion constants) and energy loss rates. We show how to
formulate effective Boltzmann equations which will be adequate to compute such
observables to leading order in the running coupling $g(T)$ of high-temperature
gauge theories [and all orders in $1/\log g(T)^{-1}$]. As previously proposed
in the literature, a leading-order treatment requires including both $2<->2$
particle scattering processes as well as effective ``$1<->2$'' collinear
splitting processes in the Boltzmann equations. The latter account for nearly
collinear bremsstrahlung and pair production/annihilation processes which take
place in the presence of fluctuations in the background gauge field. Our
effective kinetic theory is applicable not only to near-equilibrium systems
(relevant for the calculation of transport coefficients), but also to highly
non-equilibrium situations, provided some simple conditions on distribution
functions are satisfied.

satisfaction class if and only if it is recursively saturated. A proof of this
fact is presented in detail in such a way that it is adaptable to a language

existential assumptions on nonstandard terms.

with corners in the two-dimensional setting. Let a polygonal trajectory in a
billiard start and end up at the same billiard's corner point. We prove that
smooth Hamiltonian flows which limit to this billiard have a nearby periodic
orbit if and only if the polygon angles at the corner are ''acceptable''. The
criterion for a corner polygon to be acceptable depends on the smooth potential
behavior at the corners, which is expressed in terms of a {scattering
function}. We define such an asymptotic scattering function and prove the
existence of it, explain how it can be calculated and predict some of its
properties. In particular, we show that it is non-monotone for some potentials
in some phase space regions. We prove that when the smooth system has a
limiting periodic orbit it is hyperbolic provided the scattering function is
not extremal there. We then prove that if the scattering function is extremal,
the smooth system has elliptic periodic orbits limiting to the corner polygon,
and, furthermore, that the return map near these periodic orbits is conjugate
to a small perturbation of the Henon map and therefore has elliptic islands. We
find from the scaling that the island size is typically algebraic in the
smoothing parameter and exponentially small in the number of reflections of the
polygon orbit.

is found that the conversion efficiency reached is largely enhanced if the
phase mismatch induced by linear refraction is compensated. A detailed analysis

contribution from the Kerr effect cannot be compensated simultaneously with
