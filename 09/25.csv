ingredients of our analysis are the NVSS polarization data, the multifrequency
study of polarization properties of the B3-VLA sample (Mack et al. 2002) which
has allowed us to quantify Faraday depolarization effects, and the 15 GHz
survey by Taylor et al. (2001), which has provided strong constraints on the
high-frequency spectral indices of sources. The polarization degree of both
steep- and flat-spectrum at 1.4 GHz is found to be anti-correlated with the
flux density. The median polarization degree at 1.4 GHz of both steep- and
flat-spectrum sources brighter than $S(1.4 \hbox{GHz})=80 $mJy is $\simeq
2.2%$. The data by Mack et al. (2002) indicate a substantial mean Faraday
depolarization at 1.4 GHz for steep spectrum sources, while the depolarization
is undetermined for most flat/inverted-spectrum sources. Exploiting this
complex of information we have estimated the power spectrum of polarization
fluctuations due to extragalactic radio sources at microwave frequencies. We
confirm that extragalactic sources are expected to be the main contaminant of
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization maps on small angular scales. At
frequencies $< 30 $GHz the amplitude of their power spectrum is expected to be
comparable to that of the $E$-mode of the CMB. At higher frequencies, however,
the CMB dominates.

that, for a sufficiently low noise level (\sigma_{pix}) and if \tau is not
negligibly low, the degeneracy is greatly reduced, while the residual impact of
cosmic variance on n_s and \tau determinations is under control. On the
contrary, if \sigma_{pix} is too high, cosmic variance effects appear to be
magnified. We apply general results to specific experiments and find that, if
favorable conditions occur, it is possible that a 2--\sigma detection of a
lower limit on \tau is provided by the SPOrt experiment. Furthermore, if the
PLANCK experiment will measure polarization with the expected precision, the
error on low--l harmonics is adequate to determine \tau, without significant

recent anisotropy results, [1]. It is shown that the fractal character of the
matter density and magnetic field distribution leads to the likelihood of a
substantial increase of spatial fluctuations in the cosmic ray energy spectra.
While the spatial distribution of cosmic rays in the vicinity of their sources
(eg. inside the Galactic disk) does not depend much on the character of
propagation and is largely determined by the distribution of their sources, the
distribution at large distances from the Galactic disk depends strongly on the
character of the propagation. In particular, the fractal character of the ISM
leads to what is known as 'anomalous diffusion' and such diffusion helps us to
understand the formation of Cosmic Ray Halo. Anomalous diffusion allows an
explanation of the recent important result from the Chacaltaya extensive air
shower experiment [1], viz. a Galactic Plane Enhancement of cosmic ray
intensity in the Outer Galaxy, which is otherwise absent for the case of the
so-called 'normal' diffusion. All these effects are for just one reason:

radiative recombination continua. The continuum can be fitted by a power law of
photon index Gamma = 1.72 +/- 0.21 and temporal decay index alpha = 1.87 +/-
0.1, with a marginally significant excess column density of cold gas N_{H}=(4.7
+/- 3.7) x 10^{21} cm^{-2} at the redshift of the host galaxy. The absence of
iron lines indicates that the density of nearby surrounding material was
unlikely to be very dense (n < 5 x 10^{12} cm^{-3}) at the time of the Chandra
observation. In the case of recombination following photoionization in an
optically thin medium, most ionic species would be completely stripped at lower
gas densities than this. In the case of a power-law spectrum reflecting off a
``cold'', opaque medium of low density, negligible emission features would be
produced. Alternative to these possible explanations for the lack of emission
features, any X-ray line emission taking place in a dense medium in a ``nearby
reprocessor'' scenario might have been overwhelmed by the bright afterglow
continuum. Although the absence of discrete features does not unambiguously
test for a connection between GRB 020405 and nucleosynthesis, it emphasizes the

objects is, at present, unknown. We present Chandra observations of RX
J052600.3-660433, the quiescent X-ray counterpart of SGR 0526-66. Restricting
to a period range around 8-s, the period noted in the afterglow of the burst of
5 March 1979, we find evidence for a similar periodicity in two epochs of data,
obtained 20 months apart, implying a period derivative of $6.6(5)e-11$ s/s
which is similar to the period derivatives of the magnetars. The spectrum is
best fitted by a combination of a black body and a power law. However, the
photon index of the power law component, $\Gamma\sim 3$ -- intermediate to
those of AXPs and SGRs. This continuum of $\Gamma$ leads us to suggest that the
underlying physical parameter which differentiates SGRs from AXPs is manifested
in the power law component. Two decades ago, SGR 0526-66 was a classical SGR
whereas now it behaves like an AXP. Thus it is possible that the same object
cycles between SGR and AXP state. We speculate that the main difference between
AXPs and SGRs is the geometry of the $B$-fields and this geometry is time
dependent. [Abstract truncated]

distributions in the near-infrared bands are carefully compared with
pure-luminosity-evolution (PLE) as well as CDM-based hierarchical merging (HM)
models. The very flat faint-end slope of the SDF K count indicates that the
bulk (more than 90%) of cosmic background radiation (CBR) in this band is
resolved, even if we take into account every known source of incompleteness.
The integrated flux from the counts is only about a third of reported flux of
the diffuse CBR in the same band, suggesting that a new distinct source of this
missing light may be required. We discovered unusually red objects with colors
of (J-K) >~ 3-4, which are even redder than the known population of EROs, and
difficult to explain by passively evolving elliptical galaxies. A plausible
interpretation, which is the only viable one among those we examined, is that
these are dusty starbursts at high-z (z ~ 3), whose number density is
comparable with that of present-day ellipticals or spheroidal galaxies, as well
as with that of faint submillimeter sources. The photometric redshift
distribution obtained by BVRIz'JK' photometries is also compared with the data,
and the HM model is found to predict too few high-z objects at K' >~ 22 and z
>~ 2; the PLE model with reasonable amount of absorption by dust looks more
consistent with the data. This result is apparently in contradiciton with some
previous ones for shallower observations, and we discuss the origin of this.
These results raise a question for the HM models: how to form massive objects
with starbursts at such high redshifts, which presumably evolve into
present-day elliptical galaxies or bulges?

circumstellar envelope, such as the density and temperature structure, using a
detailed radiative transfer analysis. This enables abundances for the remaining
molecular species to be determined. The derived abundances generally vary
between the sources by no more than a factor of five indicating that
circumstellar envelopes around carbon stars with high mass-loss rates have
similar chemical compositions. However, there are some notable exceptions. The
most striking difference between the abundances are reflecting the spread in
the 12C/13C-ratio of about an order of magnitude between the sample stars,
mainly reflecting the results of nucleosynthesis. The abundance of SiO also
shows a variation of more than an order of magnitude between the sources and is
on the average more than an order of magnitude more abundant than predicted
from photospheric chemistry in thermal equilibrium. The over abundance of SiO
is consistent with dynamical modelling of the stellar atmosphere and the inner
parts of the wind where a pulsation-driven shock has passed. This scenario is
possibly further substantiated by the relatively low amount of CS present in
the envelopes. The chemistry occurring in the outer envelope is consistent with
current photochemical models.

we found semi-regular oscillations with the two main periods of ~3.3 yr and
11.9 yr and the full amplitude of ~0.8 mag and ~0.6 mag, respectively. The
colors of the warm dust shell (resolved by Ohnaka et al. 2001) are found to be
remarkably stable in contrast to its brightness. This indicates that the inner
radius is a constant, time-independent characteristic of the dust shell. The
observed behavior of the IR light curve is mainly caused by the variation of
the optical thickness of the dust shell within the interval \tau(V)= 0.2-0.4.
Anticorrelated changes of the optical brightness (in particular with P ~ 3.3
yr) have not been found. Their absence suggests that the stellar wind of R CrB
deviates from spherical symmetry. The light curves suggest that the stellar
wind is variable. The variability of the stellar wind and the creation of dust
clouds may be caused by some kind of activity on the stellar surface. With some
time lag, periods of increased mass-loss cause an increase in the dust
formation rate at the inner boundary of the extended dust shell and an increase
in its IR brightness. We have derived the following parameters of the dust
shell (at mean brightness) by radiative transfer modeling: inner dust shell

hence that accretion switched-off. The short timescale (less than one hour) of
this variation still remains a puzzle. Optical photometry acquired
simultaneousy during the low state shows that the white dwarf remains heated,
although a weak emission from the accretion stream could be still present.
Cyclotron radiation, usually dominating the V and R bands, is negligible thus
corroborating the possibility that AM Her was in an off-accretion state. The
X-ray emission during the inactive state is consistent with coronal emission
from the secondary late type star.

as critical points of a mean-field free energy functional. Close to the
microphase separation transition, this functional takes on a universal form,
allowing to treat a number of diverse physical situations within a unified
framework. We use asymptotic analysis to study domain patterns with sharp
interfaces. We derived an interfacial representation of the pattern's free
energy which remains valid in the fluctuating system, with a suitable
renormalization of the Coulomb interaction's coupling constant. We also derived
integrodifferential equations describing the stationary domain patterns of
arbitrary shapes and their thermodynamic stability, coming from the first and
second variation of the interfacial free energy. We showed that the length
scale of a stable domain pattern must obey a certain scaling law with the
strength of the Coulomb interaction. We analyzed existence and stability of
localized (spots, stripes, annuli) and periodic (lamellar, hexagonal) patterns
in two dimensions. We showed that these patterns are metastable in certain
ranges of the parameters and that they can undergo morphological instabilities
leading to the formation of more complex patterns. We discuss nucleation of the
domain patterns by thermal fluctuations and pattern formation scenarios for
various thermal quenches. We argue that self-induced disorder is an intrinsic

one may observe the asymptotic enlargement of the symmetry to O(N) with
N=n_1+n_2. By performing a five-loop $\epsilon$-expansion computation we
determine the fixed points and their stability. It turns out that for
N=n_1+n_2\ge 3 the O(N)-symmetric fixed point is unstable. For N=3, the
multicritical behavior is described by the biconal fixed point with critical
exponents that are very close to the Heisenberg ones. For N\ge 4 and any

interesting systems, in particular for anisotropic antiferromagnets in the

SO(5) theory of superconductivity, we show that the bicritical O(5) fixed point
is unstable with a significant crossover exponent, $\phi_{4,4}\approx 0.15$;
this implies that the O(5) symmetry is not effectively realized at the point
where the antiferromagnetic and superconducting transition lines meet. The
multicritical behavior is either governed by the tetracritical decoupled fixed

impurity is included in the ring penetrated by a magnetic flux. Due to the
interplay of the electron-electron interaction and the impurity the persistent
current in a system of N lattice sites vanishes faster then 1/N. Only for very
large systems and large impurities our results are consistent with the
bosonization prediction obtained for an effective field theory. The results
from the density matrix renormalization group and the functional
renormalization group agree well for interactions as large as the band width,
even though as an approximation in the latter method the flow of the
two-particle vertex is neglected. This confirms that the functional

electron systems. The method will become very useful for the theoretical
description of the electronic properties of small conducting ring molecules.

the surprisingly rapid deployment of some P2P applications, there are few

achieved scale, and self-organizing structure of the Gnutella network make it
an interesting P2P architecture to study. Like most other P2P applications,
Gnutella builds, at the application level, a virtual network with its own
routing mechanisms. The topology of this virtual network and the routing
mechanisms used have a significant influence on application properties such as
performance, reliability, and scalability. We have built a ""crawler"" to extract
the topology of Gnutella's application level network. In this paper we analyze
the topology graph and evaluate generated network traffic. Our two major
findings are that: (1) although Gnutella is not a pure power-law network, its
current configuration has the benefits and drawbacks of a power-law structure,
and (2) the Gnutella virtual network topology does not match well the
underlying Internet topology, hence leading to ineffective use of the physical
networking infrastructure. These findings guide us to propose changes to the
Gnutella protocol and implementations that may bring significant performance
and scalability improvements. We believe that our findings as well as our
measurement and analysis techniques have broad applicability to P2P systems and
provide unique insights into P2P system design tradeoffs.

of freedom invariant manifolds. They represent short wavelength solutions
composed of $k$ Fourier-modes and can be interpreted as embedded lattices with
periodic boundary conditions and only $k$ particles. Inside these invariant
manifolds other invariant structures and exact solutions are found which
represent for instance periodic and quasi-periodic solutions and standing and
traveling waves. Some of these results have been found previously by other
authors via a study of mode coupling coefficients and recently also by
investigating `bushes of normal modes'. The method of this paper is similar to
the latter method and much more systematic than the former. We arrive at

depend strongly on subthreshold eta-N interaction. This strong dependence is
made evident from comparing three different eta-nucleus optical potentials: (1)
a microscopic optical potential taking into account the full effects of
off-shell eta-nucleon interactions; (2) a factorization approximation to the
microscopic optical potential where a downward energy shift parameter is
introduced to approximate the subthreshold eta-nucleon interaction; and (3) an
optical potential using on-shell eta-nucleon scattering length as the
interaction input. Our analysis indicates that the in-medium $\eta$N
interaction for bound-state formation is about 30 MeV below the free-space
$\eta$N threshold, which causes a substantial reduction of the attractive force
between the $\eta$ and nucleon with respect to that implied by the scattering
length. Consequently, the scattering-length approach overpredicts the binding
energies and caution must be exercised when these latter predictions are used
as guide in searching for $\eta$-nucleus bound states. We also show that
final-state-interaction analysis cannot provide an unequivocal determination of
the existence of $\eta$-nucleus bound state. More direct measurements are,
therefore, necessary.

screened, dropping mostly along the entire molecule. In addition, we observe
pronounced Friedel oscillations that can be related to the breaking of
electron-hole symmetry. Our results are in semi-quantitative agreement with
recent state-of-the-art ab initio calculations and point to the need of a
three-dimensional treatment to properly capture the behavior of the
