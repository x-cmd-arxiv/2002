active galaxies (AGN) and then concentrate on the X-ray search for supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) in optically non-active galaxies.
  The first part focuses on recent results from the X-ray observatories Chandra
and XMM-Newton which detected a wealth of new spectral features which originate
in the nuclear region of AGN.
  In the last few years, giant-amplitude, non-recurrent X-ray flares have been
observed from several non-active galaxies. All of them share similar
properties, namely: extreme X-ray softness in outburst, huge peak luminosity
(up to ~10^{44} erg/s), and the absence of optical signs of Seyfert activity.
Tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole is the favored
explanation of these unusual events. The second part provides a review of the
initial X-ray observations, follow-up studies,and the relevant aspects of tidal
disruption models studied in the literature.

Galactic halo. For this purpose, we examine the magnetic reconnection triggered
by Parker instability (magnetic buoyancy instability), by performing the
two-dimensional resistive numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations. As a
result of numerical simulations, the system evolves as following phases: Parker
instability occurs in the Galactic disk. In the nonlinear phase of Parker
instability, the magnetic loop inflates from the Galactic disk into the
Galactic halo, and collides with the anti-parallel magnetic field, so that the
current sheets are created in the Galactic halo. The tearing instability
occurs, and creates the plasmoids (magnetic islands). Just after the plasmoid
ejection, further current-sheet thinning occurs in the sheet, and the anomalous
resistivity sets in. Petschek reconnection starts, and heats the gas quickly in
the Galactic halo. It also creates the slow and fast shock regions in the
Galactic halo. The magnetic field ($B\sim 3 \mu$G), for example, can heat the
gas ($n\sim 10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$) to temperature of $\sim 10^6$ K via the
reconnection in the Galactic halo. The gas is accelerated to Alfv\'en velocity
($\sim 300$ km s$^{-1}$). Such high velocity jets are the evidence of the
Galactic flare model we present in this paper, if the Doppler shift of the
bipolar jet is detected in the Galactic halo. Full size figures are available

a WZ Sge-type system with a long persistence of late superhumps. The outburst

system showing evidence for an accretion disk corona (ADC). Such a corona has
the potential to constrain the properties of the heated accretion disk in this
system, and other LMXBs by extension. We find evidence for line emission which
is generally consistent with that found by previous experiments, although we
are able to detect more lines. For the first time in this source, we find that
the iron K line has multiple components. We set limits on the line widths and
velocity offsets, and we fit the spectra to photoionization models and discuss
the implications for accretion disk corona models. For the first time in any
ADC source we use these fits, together with density constraints based on the O
VII line ratio, in order to constrain the flux in the medium-ionization region
of the ADC. Under various assumptions about the source luminosity this
constrains the location of the emitting region. These estimates, together with
estimates for the emission measure, favor a scenario in which the intrinsic
luminosity of the source is comparable to what we observe.

discrete) evolves on a flexible substrate which feeds back to the evolution of
the main field. We identify the underlying physics and potential applications
of such a model and examine its simplest one-dimensional Hamiltonian form,
which turns out to be a modified Frenkel-Kontorova model coupled to an extra
linear equation. We find static kink solutions and study their stability, and
then examine moving kinks (the continuum limit of the model is studied too). We
observe how the substrate effectively renormalizes properties of the kinks. In
particular, a nontrivial finding is that branches of stable and unstable kink
solutions may be extended beyond a critical point at which an effective
intersite coupling vanishes; passing this critical point does not destabilize
the kink. Kink-antikink collisions are also studied, demonstrating alternation
between merger and transmission cases.

  Physical Society of Japan, in press",,"10.1143/JPSJ.71.2700",,"nlin.PS",,"  Periodic waves are investigated in a system composed of a
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky - Korteweg-de Vries (KS-KdV) equation, which is linearly
coupled to an extra linear dissipative equation. The model describes, e.g., a
two-layer liquid film flowing down an inclined plane. It has been recently
shown that the system supports stable solitary pulses. We demonstrate that a
perturbation analysis, based on the balance equation for the field momentum,
predicts the existence of stable cnoidal waves (CnWs) in the same system. It is
found that the mean value U of the wave field u in the main subsystem, but not
the mean value of the extra field, affects the stability of the periodic waves.
Three different areas can be distinguished inside the stability region in the
parameter plane (L,U), where L is the wave's period. In these areas, stable
are, respectively, CnWs with positive velocity, constant solutions, and CnWs
with negative velocity. Multistability, i.e., the coexistence of several
attractors, including the waves with several maxima per period, appears at
large value of L. The analytical predictions are completely confirmed by direct
simulations. Stable waves are also found numerically in the limit of vanishing
dispersion, when the KS-KdV equation goes over into the KS one.

discrete quantum walk on a line, cycle and hypercube. We find high sensitivity
to decoherence, increasing with the number of steps in the walk, as the
particle is becoming more delocalised with each step. However, the effect of a
small amount of decoherence is to enhance the properties of the quantum walk
that are desirable for the development of quantum algorithms. Specifically, we
observe a highly uniform distribution on the line, a very fast mixing time on
the cycle, and more reliable hitting times across the hypercube.

the filtering procedure is required to be unambiguous, which necessitates
admitting inconclusive answers when the given states are not orthogonal. As an
application, we propose an efficient, probabilistic procedure for
distinguishing between sets of Boolean functions, which is an extension of the
Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.

that operate within a small fraction of the qubit decoherence time and with
high accuracy over a bandwidth set by the decoherence rate. Electron spin
quantum bits in Si are promising because of long decoherence times (~0.5 ms),
but electrical gating schemes still seem problematic. Oxide-semiconductor
heterostructures have the potential for precise electrical control of gate
operations in the semiconductor, using optical rectification in the
ferroelectric oxide. Accurate (~80 dB), local (~10 nm), dynamic (>THz) and
programmable optical control over electric polarization in the ferroelectric
can be achieved using existing technology. Optical techniques may also be
useful in rapid initialization of the quantum computer, and for providing a
source of initialized qubits to use for quantum error correction. Advantages of
optical methods will be discussed within a framework proposed for a quantum
information processor using ferroelectrically coupled electron spins and Ge
quantum dots in Si.
