to accumulate in the Galactic center and annihilate generating, among other

used an improved point source analysis including an energy dependent point
spread function and an unbinned maximum likelihood technique, which has allowed
us to significantly lower the limits on gamma ray flux from the Galactic
center. We find that the present EGRET data can limit many supersymmetric

we predict that most subsets drawn from BATSE Catalog will be anti-correlated
with the foreground structure due to weak lensing, i.e. will show negative
magnification bias. We find that GRBs are indeed anti-correlated with the APM

positive correlations found previously, between QSOs and APM galaxies. We

with rather little power on galaxy scales. Formally, we require s_8 G_0.6 <
0.23, where G_0.6 is a modified shape parameter appropriate to this problem.
Practically, this means either Omega_m < 0.2 or s_8 < 0.8. These limits apply
as long as we insist that the cuspy halos found in simulations must describe
the halos of low surface brightness galaxies. A low density cosmology helps
with the low observed concentrations, but it offers no explanation of the many
cases where the shape of the density profile deviates from the predicted cuspy
form. These cases must have suffered very extensive mass redistribution if the
current halo formation picture is not to fail outright. It is far from clear
whether any of the mass redistribution mechanisms which have been suggested
(e.g., feedback) are viable.

field. The radiation force is mediated primarily by spectral lines. We use
ideal MHD to compute the evolution of Keplerian disks, varying the magnetic
field strengths and the luminosity of the disk, the central accreting object or
both. We find that the magnetic fields very quickly start deviating from purely
axial due to the magnetorotational instability. This leads to fast growth of
the toroidal magnetic field. As a result the toroidal field dominates over the
poloidal field above the disk and the gradient of the former drives a slow and
dense disk outflow, which conserves specific angular momentum. Depending on the
strength of the magnetic field relative to the system luminosity the disk wind
can be radiation- or MHD driven. The pure radiation-driven wind consists of a
dense, slow outflow that is bounded on the polar side by a high-velocity
stream. The mass-loss rate is mostly due to the fast stream. As the magnetic
field strength increases first the slow part of the flow is affected, namely it
becomes denser and slightly faster and begins to dominate the mass-loss rate.
In very strong magnetic field or pure MHD cases, the wind consists of only a
dense, slow outflow without the presence of the distinctive fast stream so
typical to pure radiation-driven winds. Our simulations indicate that winds
launched by the magnetic fields are likely to remain dominated by the fields
downstream because of their relatively high densities.

Structural parameters are determined from HST NICMOS images. The galaxies show
substantial offsets from the FP of the nearby Coma cluster, as expected from
passive evolution of their stellar populations. The offsets from the FP can be
expressed as offsets in M/L ratio. The M/L ratios of the two most massive
galaxies are consistent with an extrapolation of results obtained at
z=0.02-0.83. The evolution of early-type galaxies with masses >10^11 M_sun is
well described by ln M/L(B) = (-1.06 +- 0.09) z, corresponding to passive
evolution of -1.50 +- 0.13 mag at z=1.3. Ignoring selection effects, the best
fitting stellar formation redshift is z*=2.6, corresponding to a luminosity
weighted age at the epoch of observation of ~2 Gyr. The M/L ratios of these two
galaxies are also in excellent agreement with predictions from models that
include progenitor bias. The third galaxy is a factor ~10 less massive than the
other two, shows strong Balmer absorption lines in its spectrum, and is offset
from the Coma Fundamental Plane by 2.9 mag in rest-frame B. Despite their large
range in M/L ratios, all three galaxies fall in the ``Extremely Red Object''
(ERO) class with I-H>3 and R-K>5, and our results show that it is hazardous to
use simple models for converting luminosity to mass for these objects.
Measurements of M/L ratios at high redshift can be considered first steps to
empirically disentangle luminosity and mass evolution at the high mass end of
the galaxy population, lifting an important degeneracy in the interpretation of
evolution of the luminosity function. [SHORTENED]

of distance x from the ionization front, exhibits properties which agree with
our long-slit spectrum of the Orion nebula. For instance, there exist a unicity
relation between both the Hbeta surface brightness or the ionization front
[SII] density, and the scale L of the powerlaw, where L is the distance between
the ionization front and the onset of the density near the exciting star.
Internal dust is required to obtain a simultaneous acceptable fit of both the
[SII] density and then Hbeta suface brightness observations. Nebular models
containing small dust grains provide a better fit than large grains. The line
ratio gradients observed along the slit are qualitatively reproduced by our
density stratified models assuming a stellar temperature of 38000 K.
Collisional deexcitation appears to be responsible for half of the gradient

structure of stellar coronae in active binary systems from the EMD, electron
densities, and scale sizes. Observations obtained by the EUVE during 9 years of
operation are included for the stars in the sample. EUVE data allow a
continuous EMD to be constructed in the range log T~5.6-7.4, using iron
emission lines. These data are complemented with IUE observations to model the
lower temperature range. Inspection of the EMD shows an outstanding narrow
enhancement, or ``bump'' peaking around log T~6.9 in 25 of the stars, defining
a fundamental coronal structure. The emission measure per unit stellar area
decreases with increasing orbital (or photometric) periods of the target stars;
stars in binaries generally have more material at coronal temperatures than
slowly rotating single stars. High electron densities (Ne>10^12 cm^-3) are
derived at ~10 MK for some targets, implying small emitting volumes. The
observations suggest the magnetic stellar coronae of these stars are consistent
with two basic classes of magnetic loops: solar-like loops with maximum
temperature around log T~6.3 and lower electron densities (Ne>10^9-10.5), and
hotter loops peaking around log T~6.9 with higher electron densities
(Ne>10^12). For the most active stars, material exists at much higher
temperatures (log T>6.9) as well. However, current ab initio stellar loop
models cannot reproduce such a configuration. Analysis of the light curves of
these systems reveals signatures of rotation of coronal material, as well as

line emission and dust cooling via the far-IR continuum emission on the global
scale of a galaxy in normal (i.e. non-AGN dominated and non-starburst)
late-type systems. It is known that the luminosity ratio of total gas and dust
cooling, L(C II)/L(FIR), shows a non-linear behaviour with the equivalent width
of the Halpha line emission, the ratio decreasing in galaxies of lower massive
star-formation activity. This result holds despite the fact that known
individual Galactic and extragalactic sources of the [C II] line emission show
different [C II] line-to-far-IR continuum emission ratios. This non-linear
behaviour is reproduced by a simple quantitative model of gas and dust heating
from different stellar populations, assuming that the photoelectric effect on
dust, induced by far-UV photons, is the dominant mechanism of gas heating in
the general diffuse interstellar medium of the galaxies under investigation.
According to the model, the global L(C II)/L(FIR) provides a direct measure of
the fractional amount of non-ionizing UV light in the interstellar radiation
field and not of the efficiency of the photoelectric heating. The model also
defines a method to constrain the stellar initial mass function from
measurements of L(C II) and L(FIR). A sample of 20 Virgo cluster galaxies
observed in the [C II] line with the LWS on board ISO is used to illustrate the
model. The limited statistics and the necessary assumptions behind the
determination of the global [C II] luminosities from the spatially limited data
do not allow us to establish definitive conclusions but data-sets available in

electrical resistance observed below the critical temperature in granular
high-Tc superconductors submitted to a magnetic field H. Reported experimental
results obtained on a YBCO sample show that the superconducting transition
occurs in two stages, with a steep drop of the resistance at Tc and a
subsequent, smoother decrease. In this second stage, the resistance vs.
temperature curve is strongly dependent not only on the field intensity, but
also on the angle between H and the macroscopic current density j.
  We start from the assumption that the resistance below Tc is mainly due to
the weak links between grains. In the model, weak links are thought of as flat
surface elements separating adjacent grains. We calculate the probability for a
weak link to undergo the transition to the resistive state, as a function of
the angles it makes with the external magnetic field H and the macroscopic
current density j. In doing this, an important role is given to the strong
non-uniformity of the local magnetic field within the specimen, due to the
effect of the screening supercurrents flowing on the surface of the grains.
Finally, we calculate the electrical resistance of the sample in the two cases
where H is parallel and perpendicular to j, respectively. The predictions of
this simple model turn out to be in reasonable agreement with reported
experimental results obtained on a YBCO granular specimen.

is to split the binodal curve into cloud and shadow curves that cross at the
critical point (which, in general, is not at the maximum of either curve).
Recent theories of polydispersity have shown, in favorable cases, how to
project the (infinite-dimensional) free energy of the polydisperse system into
a low dimensional space of `moment densities'. We address here the issue of how
to construct a Landau expansion from the projected free energy. For the
simplest case where the excess free energy depends on one moment density
$\rho_1$ (this includes Flory Huggins theory for length-polydisperse chains) we
show that the minimal expansion remains quartic in $\rho_1$ but nonetheless has
seven independent coefficients, not two. When this expansion is handled
correctly all the peculiar qualitative features of the polydisperse phase
diagram are recovered, as are the slopes of the cloud and shadow curves, and
the curvature of the cloud. However, to correctly predict the curvature of the
shadow, certain fifth order terms must be retained. We also consider the phase
diagram on the temperature-pressure plane, where the coexistence line broadens
into a region. In general, the critical point lies between the point of maximum
temperature and the point of maximum pressure on the perimeter of this region.
This behaviour is again captured by the Landau expansion.

our approach the quantity of information is measured by the Algorithmic
Information Content (Kolmogorov complexity) or by a sort of computable version

the use of a suitable universal data compression algorithm. We apply these
notions to the study of dynamical systems by considering the asymptotic
behavior of the quantity of information necessary to describe their orbits.
When a system is ergodic, this method provides an indicator which equals the
Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy almost everywhere. Moreover, if the entropy is 0, our
method gives new indicators which measure the unpredictability of the system
and allows to classify various kind of weak chaos. Actually this is the main
motivation of this work. The behaviour of a zero entropy dynamical system is
far to be completely predictable exept that in particular cases. In fact there
are 0 entropy systems which exibit a sort of {\it weak chaos} where the
information necessary to describe the orbit behavior increases with time more

entropy case). Also, we believe that the above method is useful for the
classification of zero entropy time series. To support this point of view, we
show some theoretical and experimenthal results in specific cases.

with an external field $i\pi/2$ applied to the dual sites centered at

concerning presentation of the hysteresis loop for ferromagnets occurring in

definition of the 'coercivity' reveals two distinct notions referred to the
hysteresis loop: B vs H or M vs H, which can be easily confused and, in fact,
are confused in several textbooks. The properties of the M vs H type hysteresis
loop are often ascribed to the B vs H type loops, giving rise to various
misconceptions. An extensive survey of textbooks at first in the SSP/CMP area
and later extended into the areas of general physics, materials science and
magnetism / electromagnetism has been carried out. Relevant encyclopedias and
physics dictionaries have also been consulted. The survey has revealed various
other substantial misconceptions and/or misinterpretations than those
originally identified in the SSP/CMP area. The results are presented here to
help clarifying the misconceptions and misinterpretations in question. The
physics education aspects arising from the textbook survey are also discussed.

Bifurcation and Chaos, Vol.11, No.8, pp.2133-2144, 2001",,,"cs.AI cs.MA cs.NE",,"  We show how coupling of local optimization processes can lead to better
solutions than multi-start local optimization consisting of independent runs.
This is achieved by minimizing the average energy cost of the ensemble, subject
to synchronization constraints between the state vectors of the individual
local minimizers. From an augmented Lagrangian which incorporates the
synchronization constraints both as soft and hard constraints, a network is
derived wherein the local minimizers interact and exchange information through
the synchronization constraints. From the viewpoint of neural networks, the
array can be considered as a Lagrange programming network for continuous
optimization and as a cellular neural network (CNN). The penalty weights
associated with the soft state synchronization constraints follow from the
solution to a linear program. This expresses that the energy cost of the
ensemble should maximally decrease. In this way successful local minimizers can
implicitly impose their state to the others through a mechanism of master-slave
dynamics resulting into a cooperative search mechanism. Improved information
spreading within the ensemble is obtained by applying the concept of
small-world networks. This work suggests, in an interdisciplinary context, the
importance of information exchange and state synchronization within ensembles,
towards issues as evolution, collective behaviour, optimality and intelligence.

general relativity therefore splits naturally into two halves: data that form a
black hole in the evolution and data that do not. The spacetimes that are
evolved from initial data near the black hole threshold have many properties
that are mathematically analogous to a critical phase transition in statistical
mechanics.
  Solutions near the black hole threshold go through an intermediate attractor,
called the critical solution. The critical solution is either time-independent
(static) or scale-independent (self-similar). In the latter case, the final
black hole mass scales as $(p-p_*)^\gamma$ along any one-parameter family of
data with a regular parameter $p$ such that $p=p_*$ is the black hole threshold
in that family. The critical solution and the critical exponent $\gamma$ are
universal near the black hole threshold for a given type of matter.
  We show how the essence of these phenomena can be understood using dynamical
systems theory and dimensional analysis. We then review separately the analogy
with critical phase transitions in statistical mechanics, and aspects specific
to general relativity, such as spacetime singularities. We examine the evidence
that critical phenomena in gravitational collapse are generic, and give an
overview of their rich phenomenology.

calculate the gravitational-wave growth timescale for these unstable modes and

nonlinear Heisenberg's commutator equations where the nonlinear terms are
generated by the two-body interaction that excites the reference vacuum via
particle-particle and particle-hole excitations. Nonperturbative solutions of
the system are obtained with the use of dynamic linearization approximation and
cluster transformation coefficients. The dynamic linearization approximation
converts the commutator chain into an eigenvalue problem. The cluster
coefficients factorize the matrix elements of the (n)-particles or
particle-hole systems in terms of the matrix elements of the (n-1)-systems
coupled to a particle-particle, particle-hole, and hole-hole boson. Group
properties of the particle-particle, particle-hole, and hole-hole permutation
groups simplify the calculation of these coefficients. The particle-particle
vacuum-excitations generate superconductive diagrams in the dynamics of
3-quarks systems. Applications of the model to fermionic and bosonic systems
are discussed.

pure SU(2) gauge theory. This is accomplished by using Abelian projection to
split the SU(2) gauge fields into an Abelian subgroup and its coset. The two
gauge field components of the coset part act as the effective, complex, scalar
field of the GL equation. The Abelian part of the SU(2) gauge field is then
analogous to the electromagnetic potential in the GL equation. An important
aspect of the dual superconducting model is for the GL Lagrangian to have a
spontaneous symmetry breaking potential, and the existence of Nielsen-Olesen
flux tube solutions. Both of these require a tachyonic mass for the effective
scalar field. Such a tachyonic mass term is obtained from the condensation of

term $\propto \gamma_ p(k)$, representing the fluid-particle friction
(described by Stokes law). The statistical description of turbulence within the
model is simplified by a modification of the usual closure procedure based on
the Richardson-Kolmogorov picture of turbulence with a differential
approximation for the energy transfer term. The resulting ordinary differential
equation for the energy budget is solved analytically for various important
limiting cases and numerically in the general case. In the inertial interval of
scales we describe analytically two competing effects: the energy suppression
due to the fluid particle friction and the energy enhancement during the
cascade process due to decrease of the effective density of the small scale
motions. An additional suppression or enhancement of the energy density may
occur in the viscous subrange, caused by the variation of the extent of the
inertial interval due to the combined effect of the fluid-particle friction and
the decrease of the kinematic viscosity of the suspensions. The analytical
description of the complicated interplay of these effects supported by
numerical calculations is presented. Our findings allow one to rationalize the
qualitative picture of the isotropic homogeneous turbulence of dilute

CM the dynamics is determined by the Lie algebra of Poisson brackets on the

q={q,H}, d/dt p={p,H}, QM evolves (in Heisenberg's picture) according to the
formally similar Lie algebra of commutator brackets of the corresponding

common framework for comparing CM and QM is the category of symplectic
manifolds. Other than previous authors, this paper considers phase space of
Heisenberg's picture, i.e., the manifold of pairs of operator observables (Q,P)
