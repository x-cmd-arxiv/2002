environments provides an opportunity to study directly the process of globular
cluster formation. Empirically it appears that globular cluster formation
occurs preferentially in regions in which star formation occurs at a high rate
and efficiency. Further, the interstellar medium in such regions is likely to
be at a higher pressure than less active star-forming environments. An
additional observational clue to the globular cluster formation process is that
young globular clusters have little or no mass-radius relationship. In this
paper I argue that high pressure and high star-formation efficiency are
responsible for current globular cluster formation. I suggest that the
precursors to globular clusters are molecular clouds and that the mass-radius
relationship exhibited by such clouds is wiped out by a variable star formation
efficiency.

computed in the relativistic Cowling approximation, in which all metric
perturbations are ignored. For the modal analysis, we employ three-component
relativistic neutron star models with a solid crust, a fluid core, and a fluid
ocean. As a measure for the relativistic effects on the oscillation modes, we
calculate the relative frequency difference defined as
$\delta\sigma/\sigma\equiv(\sigma_{GR}-\sigma_N)/\sigma_{GR}$, where
$\sigma_{GR}$ and $\sigma_R$ are, respectively, the relativistic and the
Newtonian oscillation frequencies. The relative difference
$\delta\sigma/\sigma$ takes various values for different oscillation modes of
the neutron star model, and the value of $\delta\sigma/\sigma$ for a given mode
depends on the physical properties of the models. We find that
$|\delta\sigma/\sigma|$ is less than $\sim0.1$ for most of the oscillation
modes we calculate, although there are a few exceptions such as the fundamental
(nodeless) toroidal torsional modes in the crust, the surface gravity modes
confined in the surface ocean, and the core gravity modes trapped in the fluid
core. We also find that the modal properties, represented by the
eigenfunctions, are not strongly affected by introducing general relativity. It
is however shown that the mode characters of the two interfacial modes,
associated with the core/crust and crust/ocean interfaces, have been
interchanged between the two through an avoided crossing when we move from
Newtonian dynamics to general relativistic dynamics.

cluster formation rate is constant, then the mass and age distributions of the
observed clusters will each show two powerlaw relations. The values of t_4 and
gamma can be derived from these relations. We used this method to derive the
cluster disruption time in specific regions in four galaxies: the inner region
of M51, a region of M33, the SMC and the solar neighbourhood. The values of
gamma are the same in the four galaxies within the uncertainty and the mean
value is gamma= 0.62 +- 0.06. However the disruption time t_4 of a cluster of

be described by an additive two-body potential whose functional form is common
to all substances which only differ in the energy \epsilon and range l scales
of the potential. With this choice De Boer's quantum theorem of corresponding
states holds thus implying that ground-state properties expressed in
appropriate reduced form are only determined by the dimensionless parameter
\lambda_{0}^{2} \sim \hbar^{2}/ml^{2}\epsilon measuring the strength of
zero-point motion in the system. The presence of a minimum in the two-body
interaction potential leads to a many-body bound state which is a Luttinger
liquid. As \lambda_{0} increases, the asymmetry of the two-body potential
causes quantum expansion, softening, and eventual evaporation of the Luttinger
liquid into a gas phase. Selecting the pair interaction potential in the Morse
form we analytically compute the properties of the Luttinger liquid and its
range of existence. As lambda_{0} increases, the system first undergoes a
discontinuous evaporation transition into a diatomic gas followed by a
continuous dissociation transition into a monoatomic gas. In particular we find
that spin-polarized isotopes of hydrogen and He-3 are monoatomic gases, He-4 is
a diatomic gas, while molecular hydrogen and heavier substances are Luttinger
liquids. We also investigate the effect of finite pressure on the properties of
the liquid and monoatomic gas phases. In particular we estimate a pressure at

shown that the nonequilibrium Green's function at high-voltage limit is
identical to the equilibrium Green's function at high-temperature limit. This
correspondence holds when the couplings of the dot and two leads, at the left

local fluctuations of the kinetic energy of electrons. Comparison with

matured over the past fifteen years to a mathematically rigorous candidate
quantum field theory of the gravitational field. The features that distinguish
it from other quantum gravity theories are 1) background independence and 2)
minimality of structures. Background independence means that this is a
non-perturbative approach in which one does not perturb around a given,
distinguished, classical background metric, rather arbitrary fluctuations are
allowed, thus precisely encoding the quantum version of Einstein's radical
perception that gravity is geometry. Minimality here means that one explores
the logical consequences of bringing together the two fundamental principles of
modern physics, namely general covariance and quantum theory, without adding
any experimentally unverified additional structures. The approach is purposely
conservative in order to systematically derive which basic principles of
physics have to be given up and must be replaced by more fundamental ones. QGR
unifies all presently known interactions in a new sense by quantum mechanically
implementing their common symmetry group, the four-dimensional diffeomorphism
group, which is almost completely broken in perturbative approaches. These
lectures offer a problem -- supported introduction to the subject.

isospin and the flavor SU(3) structure of the effective Hamiltonian provide
several relations among the amplitudes and strong phases. Whereas a global fit
to the latest data shows that some relation seems not to be favorable for a
consistent explanation to the current data within the standard model (SM). By
considering several patterns of SU(3) breaking, the amplitudes and the
corresponding strong phases are extracted and compared with the theoretical
estimations. It is found that in the case of SU(3) limits and also the case
with SU(3) breaking only in amplitudes, the fitting results lead to an
unexpected large ratio between two isospin amplitudes
$a^{c}_{3/2}/a^{u}_{3/2}$, which is about an order of magnitude larger than the
SM prediction. The results are found to be insensitive to the weak phase
$\gamma$. By including SU(3) breaking effects on the strong phases, one is able
to obtain a consistent fit to the current data within the SM, which implies
that the SU(3) breaking effect on strong phases may play an important role in
understanding the observed charmless hadronic B decay modes $B\to \pi \pi$ and
$\pi K$. It is possible to test those breaking effects in the near future from
more precise measurements of direct CP violation in B factories.

distribution of quarks in a transversely polarized proton can be asymmetric.
This ``Sivers effect'' had already been used to explain transverse single spin
asymmetries (SSA) observed in inclusive pion production, p(transv. polarized) p
--> pion + X and p-bar(transv. polarized) p --> pion + X. In such channels,
however, other mechanisms, like the ``Collins effect'' (a k_T asymmetric
fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark into pions), may generate SSA.
The Sivers asymmetry is used here to compute SSA in Drell-Yan processes; in
this case, by considering the differential cross-section in the lepton-pair
invariant mass, rapidity and transverse momentum, other mechanisms which may
originate SSA cannot contribute. Estimates for RHIC experiments are given.

addition to the $O(\alpha_s)$ part induced by hard gluon exchanges, a

  Here, we present a relevant subclass of such models, in continuous time, with

""enlarge"" the permutation group of our previous (joint with T.Rivoal) work by
showing that the total 120-permutation group for $\zeta(2)$ (known thanks to

the irrationality property of numbers (e.g., of Catalan's constant) from
existence of suitable second-order difference equations (recursions).

its tensor square which satisfy quasitriangularity conditions (in particular,
it is a solution of the QYBE). Independently, the authors also found, by means
of quantum groups, that F[[g^*]] has a braiding.

shown to clarify why base triplets of some precursor amino acids differ by a

First, the model indicated that the direction of code evolution changed on
expansion from the N-fixers code (stage 2). Growth of the code from 16 codons
in the NAN column (N, any standard nucleotide) proceeded by assignment of
codons in the GNN, ANN, CNN and UNN rows. Expansion phase (stage 4 to 7)
precursor/product pairs that spanned this shift included aspartate/threonine,
aspartate/methionine and glutamate/proline. Both 5' and mid-base differ in the
codons of each of these pairs. Second, post-expansion additions (stage 9 to 14)
required codon reassignment, eliminating initial correlations. Codons for the
post-expansion pair, aspartate (glutamate)/arginine, also differ at both 5' and
mid-base sites. Third, the distribution of core structure groups among
acceptors indicated that variant tRNA specific for a sibling, rather than
precursor, commonly participated as cofactors in early amino acid synthesis.
Sibling pairs, rather than precursor/product pairs, then exhibit codon
correlations. On removing these sources of variation, highly significant
correlations emerged between codons assigned to biosynthetically related amino
acids.

dynamides, streamlined in a close-packed crystalline lattice. Every dynamide is
a neutral pair, consistent by two massless opposite point-like elementary
electric charges (ElmElcChrgs): electrino (-) and positrino (+). In a frozen
equilibrium position two contrary pont-like ElmElcChrgs within every one
dynamide are very closely installed one to another and therefore the aggregate
polarization of every dynamide and its electric field also have zero values.
The aggregate electric field of every dynamide polarizes nearest neighbors
dynamides in an account of which nearest dynamides interact between them-self,
because of which their elementary excitations, phonons and photons, have a wave
character and behaviors. We suppose that the photon is an polarization result
of the phonon within the fluctuating vacuum considered as an ideal dielectric
and therefore the photon could be considered as an elementary collective
excitation of the FlcVcm in the form of a solitary needle cylindrical harmonic
oscillation. Hence the light, which is a packet of the photons, must move
within FlcVcm with constant velocity and Dopler effect must be observed in both
cases, for the light and sound. Then all mathematical results of Lorentz
