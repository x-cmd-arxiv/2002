\chandra image reveals, for the first time, X-ray cavities in the hot gas
within the central 15 kpc radius of A478. Two weak and small ($\sim$ 4 kpc)
radio lobes that extend from the central nucleus, are detected in a 1.4 GHz VLA
observation. The radio lobes are roughly along the direction of the X-ray
cavities, but are much smaller than the X-ray cavities. We propose a ``donut''
configuration for the hot gas within the central 15 kpc, created by the
interaction of the gas with the radio plasma that originated from the nucleus.
The current radio activity of the central radio source is weak ($\sim$ 0.2% of
Hydra A) and the total radio power is at least 10 times smaller than the
minimum power needed to create the cavities. We compare A478 with other galaxy
clusters where similar X-ray cavities were found. A478 and A4059 host much
weaker central radio sources than do others with similar size X-ray cavities.
On larger scales, deprojected temperature and density profiles are obtained for
A478. We used these to derive the Compton y-parameter, for the first time,
through direct integration. The result has a much smaller statistical
uncertainty than previous ones. This serves as an example of how high quality
X-ray data can help constrain H$_{0}$. The corresponding H$_{0}$ also was
derived combining the available Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) measurement.

galaxy is dominated by an old population (> 7 Gyr). In addition, an
intermediate-age population (200 Myr to 7 Gyr) is detected, which is consistent
with the presence of a few hundred Asymptotic Giant Branch stars with heavy
mass loss. Furthermore, young stars (< 200 Myr) are found across the inner
Bulge. The metallicities of these stellar population components are discussed.
These results can be interpreted in terms of an early epoch of intense star
formation and chemical enrichment which shaped the bulk of the Bulge and
nucleus, and a more continuous star formation history which gradually shaped
the disk from the accretion of sub-solar metallicity gas from the halo. A
possible increase in star formation about 200 Myr ago might have been triggered
by a minor merger. Ever since the formation of the first stars, mechanisms have
been at play that mix the populations from the nucleus, Bulge and disk.
Luminosity functions across the inner galactic plane indicate the presence of
an inclined (bar) structure at > 1 kpc from the galactic centre, near the inner
Lindblad resonance. The innermost part of the Bulge, within about 1 kpc from

basic questions concerning these galaxies we present the results of a survey
designed to constrain the characteristics and properties of the stellar
populations in a magnitude complete sample of low-mass cluster galaxies (LMCGs)
in the center of the Perseus cluster. Using deep, high-quality WIYN UBR images,
we demonstrate that the 53 LMCGs in our sample have a significant scatter about
the color-magnitude relationship at M_B > -15. By comparing single-burst
stellar population models to our photometry, we argue that stellar populations
in LMCGs all have ages > 1 Gyrs, with redder LMCGs having stellar metallicities
[Fe/H] > -0.5. By assuming that the colors of LMCGs reflect metallicity, and
have co-evolved with the giant ellipticals, we find a wide range of values,
from solar to [Fe/H] ~ -3. We argue from this that LMCGs have multiple origins,
and fundamentally differ from Local Group dwarf spheroidals/ellipticals. The
inferred lower metallicities of the bluer LMCGs implies that these are possibly
primordial galaxies formed through self enrichment and stellar feedback
provided by winds from supernova. We also investigate several other formation
scenarios for these LMCGS, including: self enrichment induced by the
confinement of metals in halos by the intracluster medium, in situ formation
out of intracluster gas, systems with extreme dark halos, and as remnants of
higher mass systems. We conclude that roughly half of all low-mass cluster
galaxies have stellar populations and kinematic properties, discussed in
previous papers in this series, consistent with being the remnants of stripped
galaxies accreted into clusters a few Gyrs ago.

which probe spatial scales from 5000 AU to 500 AU, directly in the visibility
domain by comparison to synthetic observations constructed from models that
assume different physical conditions. This approach allows for much more
stringent constraints to be derived from the data than from analysis of images.
A single radial power law in density provides a good description of the data,
with best fit power law index p=1.65+/-0.05. Through simulations, we quantify
the sensitivity of this result to various model uncertainties, including
assumptions of temperature distribution, outer boundary, dust opacity spectral
index, and an unresolved central component. The largest uncertainty comes from
the unknown presence of a centralized point source. A point source with 1.2mm
flux of F=12+/-7 mJy reduces the density index to p=1.47+/-0.07. The remaining
sources of systematic uncertainty, the most important of which is the
temperature distribution, likely contribute a total uncertainty of < 0.2. We
therefore find strong evidence that the power law index of the density
distribution within 5000 AU is significantly less than the value at larger
radii, close to 2.0 from previous studies of dust emission and extinction.
These results conform well to the generic paradigm of isolated, low-mass star
formation which predicts a power law density index close to p=1.5 for an inner
region of gravitational free fall onto the protostar.

model setup of a central star surrounded by an accretion disk. We find that the
diffusive jets propagate slower into the ambient medium. Close to the star we
find that a quasi stationary state evolves after several hundred (weak
diffusion) or thousand (strong diffusion) disk rotations. Magnetic diffusivity
affects the protostellar jet structure as follows. The jet poloidal magnetic
field becomes de-collimated. The jet velocity increases with increasing
diffusivity, while the degree of collimation for the hydrodynamic flow remains
more or less the same. We suggest that the mass flux is a proper tracer for the
degree of jet collimation and find indications of a critical value for the
magnetic diffusivity above which the jet collimation is only weak.

each line distributed all over the region where previous single-dish emission
was found (Morata et al. 1997). Each molecular transition traces differently
the clump distribution, although in some cases the detected clumps are
coincident. The distribution of the N2H+ emission and the single-dish NH3
emission are coincident and compatible with an origin in the same gas. The
large fraction of missing flux measured for the CS (2-1) transition can be
explained if the cloud is formed by a clumpy and heterogeneous medium. Four
positions were selected to derive the abundance ratios [N2H+/CS] and [HCO+/CS]
from the molecular column density determinations, and to compare them with the
values predicted by the chemical model. The model was able to explain the
interferometric observations, and, in particular, the chemical differentiation
of the detected clumps and the coincidence of the NH3 and N2H+ emissions. The
lack of HCO+ towards the two selected positions that trace the more evolved
clumps cannot be accounted for by the model, but it is possibly due to strong
self-absorption. We propose a classification of the studied clumps according to
the stage of chemical evolution indicated by the molecular abundances.

advantage of the new scheme of approximation is that it is valid even if the

inflation, which allows a comparison with an exact result. It is demonstrated
that the WKB approximation predicts the spectral indices exactly and the
amplitude with an error lower than 10%, even in regimes far from

constrained ferroelectric system with vanishing surface polarization is
considered. Computer simulations of the hysteresis reveal that the corners of

the great mysteries of the physics of condensed matter. While the fast process,

controversially debated. Two scenarios have evolved during recent years: the BP
is truly collective in nature or, alternatively, it results from localized

high-frequency dielectric loss of plastic crystals (PCs), having long-range
translational but no orientational order. Having in mind the well-defined
phonon modes in PCs compared to canonical glasses, and the infrared silence of
acoustic phonon modes, millimeter-wave and far-infrared spectroscopy should
provide valuable hints on the true origin of the BP. Here we show that PCs
exhibit a BP-like feature with markedly different spectral shape compared to
canonical glasses, evidencing that mixing of collective phonon with local
relaxational modes causes the BP. In addition, we find clear evidence for a

superposition, and is only equivalent to the interaction energy shift for a
pure superposition. A Quantum Boltzmann equation describing collisions is
derived using Quantum Kinetic Theory, taking into account the different
scattering lengths of the internal states. As spin-wave experiments are likely
to be attempted at lower temperatures we examine the effect of degeneracy on
decoherence by considering the recent experiment of Lewandowski et al. where
degeneracy is around 10%. We also find that the segregation effect is only

initial velocity distributions and arbitrary dimension. An analytical
derivation of the hierarchy equations obeyed by the reduced distributions is
given, and a scaling analysis of the corresponding spatially homogeneous system

equation for dimensions larger than one and provides expressions for the
exponents describing the decay of the particle density n(t) ~ t^{-\xi} and the
root mean-square velocity ${\bar v} ~ t^{-\gamma}$ in term of a parameter
related to the dissipation of kinetic energy. The Boltzmann equation is then
solved perturbatively within a systematic expansion in Sonine polynomials.
Analytical expressions for the exponents $\xi$ and $\gamma$ are obtained in
arbitrary dimension as a function of the parameter $\mu$ characterizing the
small velocity behavior of the initial velocity distribution. Moreover, the
leading non-Gaussian corrections to the scaled velocity distribution are
computed. These expressions for the scaling exponents are in good agreement
with the values reported in the literature for continuous velocity
distributions in $d=1$. For the two dimensional case, we implement Monte-Carlo

best way to extract the value of the $V_{us}$ element of the CKM matrix. The
radiative corrections become crucial if one wants a precise value of $V_{us}$.
The existing calculations were performed in the late 60's \cite{B,G} and are in
disagreement. The calculation in \cite{G} turns out to be ultraviolet cutoff
sensitive. The necessity of precise knowledge of $V_{us}$ and the contradiction
between the existing results constitute the motivation of our paper.
  We remove the ultraviolet cutoff dependence by using A.Sirlin's prescription;
we set it equal to the $W$ mass. We establish the whole character of small
lepton mass dependence based on the renormalization group approach. In this way
we can provide a simple explanation of Kinoshita--Lee--Nauenberg cancellation
of singularities in the lepton mass terms in the total width and pion spectrum.
We give an explicit evaluation of the structure--dependent photon emission
based on ChPT in the lowest order. We estimate the accuracy of our results to
be at the level of 1%. The corrected total width is $\Gamma=\Gamma_0(1+\delta)$
with $\delta=0.02\pm0.0002$. Using the formfactor value $f_+(0)=0.9842\pm

of independent experiments we show that one may systematically eliminate these

may render the proposed experiments unfeasible, at the conceptual level the

the masses of the $\pi^0$ meson, $\pi^+$ meson, the muon $\mu^+$ and the muon
neutrino $\nu_{\mu}$. We then extend the knot model to the basic mesons $K^0,

by the prime knots ${\bf 6_1, 6_2, 6_3, 6_3, 7_1, 7_2, 7_2}$ respectively where
${\bf 6_1, 6_2, 6_3, 7_1, 7_2}$ are assigned with the prime numbers $11, 13,17,

recovering quantum mechanics as a new non-classical mechanics on a

to a generalized equivalence/strong covariance principle in the form of free
motion equations $D^2x/ds^2=0$, where $D/ds$ are covariant derivatives built
from the description of the fractal/non-derivable geometry. Following the same
line of thought and using the mathematical tool of Hamilton's bi-quaternions,
we propose here a derivation of the Dirac equation also from a geodesic
equation (while it is still merely postulated in standard quantum physics). The
complex nature of the wave function in the Schr\""odinger and Klein-Gordon
equations was deduced from the necessity to introduce, because of the
non-derivability, a discrete symmetry breaking on the proper time differential
element. By extension, the bi-quaternionic nature of the Dirac bi-spinors
arises here from further discrete symmetry breakings on the space-time
variables, which also proceed from non-derivability.

This model includes Randall-Sundrum model (with $b=0$) and five-dimensional
Ho\v{r}ava-Witten theory (with $b=1$). We consider matter on both branes and
arbitrary potentials on the branes and in the bulk. These matter and potentials
induce the cosmological expansion of the brane as well as the time evolution of
the bulk scalar field and the radion. Starting with full five-dimensional
equations, we derive four-dimensional effective equations which govern the
low-energy dynamics of brane worlds. A correspondent five-dimensional geometry
is also obtained. The effective four-dimensional theory on a positive tension
brane is described by bi-scalar tensor theory. If the radion is stabilized, the
effective theory becomes Brans-Dicke (BD) theory with BD parameter $1/2 b^2$.
On the other hand, if the scalar field is stabilized, the effective theory
becomes scalar-tensor theory with BD parameter
$\frac{3}{2(3b^2+1)}\frac{\phi(t)}{1-\phi(t)}$ where $\phi$ is the BD field
defined by radion $d(t)$. If we do not introduce the stabilization mechanism
for these moduli fields, the acceptable late time cosmology can be realized
only if the dilaton coupling $b$ is small ($b^2 < 1.6 \times 10^{-4}$) and the
negative tension brane is sufficiently away from the positive tension brane. We
also construct several models for inflationary brane worlds driven by
potentials on the brane and in the bulk.

Using the mathematical concept of program-size complexity, we exhibit
irreducible mathematical facts, mathematical facts that cannot be demonstrated

curvature, i.e. is greater for eta < 1 than for eta = 1, the plane Couette
limit. For fixed Re < 130 it is found that the greatest transient growth is
achieved for eta between the Taylor-Couette linear stability boundary, if it
exists, and one, while for Re > 130 the greatest transient growth is achieved
for eta on the linear stability boundary. Transient growth is shown to be
approximately 20% higher near the linear stability boundary at Re = 310, eta =
0.986 than at Re = 310, eta = 1, near the threshold observed for transition in
plane Couette flow. The energy in the optimal inputs is primarily meridional;
that in the optimal outputs is primarily azimuthal. Pseudospectra are

pseudospectra adhere more closely to the spectrum than in a narrow gap case,

small conductive elastic element with low damping rate and therefore a high Q

elastic element which, in the presence of a magnetic field, causes an AC force
on the element. When the frequency of the AC current matches the resonant
frequency of the element, maximum vibration of the element occurs and this can
be measured precisely by optical means. We have built and tested a model sensor
of this type using for the elastic element a length of copper wire of diameter
0.030 mm formed into a loop shape. The wire motion was measured using a light
emitting diode photo-transistor assembly. This sensor demonstrated a
sensitivity better than 0.001G for an applied magnetic field of $ \sim 1$G and
a good selectivity for the magnetic field direction. The sensitivity can be
easily improved by a factor of $\sim 10 - 100$ by more sensitive measurement of
the elastic element motion and by having the element in vacuum to reduce the
drag force.
