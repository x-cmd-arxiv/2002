the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR's) is based on two
arguments: (i) The average energy generation rate of UHECR's is similar to the
gamma-ray generation rate of GRB's, and (ii) The constraints that UHECR sources
must satisfy to allow proton acceleration to >10^{20} eV are similar to those
inferred for GRB sources from gamma-ray observations. We show that recent GRB
and UHECR observations strengthen both arguments, and hence strengthen the

to set stronger constraint on the bulge age, which we found to be as large as
that of Galactic globular clusters, or $\gsim 10$ Gyr. No trace is found for
any younger stellar population. Synthetic CMDs have been constructed to
simulate the effect of photometric errors, blending, differential reddening,

spectra show emission throughout the entire X-ray temperature range, but
increasingly less emission at lower temperatures than the cooling-flow model
would predict. These results are difficult to reconcile with simple
prescriptions for distorting the emission measure distribution, e.g. by
including additional heating or rapid cooling terms. We enumerate some
theoretical difficulties in understanding the soft X-ray spectra of
cooling-flows independent of the classic problem of the failure to detect the
cooling-flow sink. Empirically, the differential luminosity distribution is
consistent with being proportional to the temperature to the power of $\approx$
1 to 2, instead of being independent of the temperature, as expected in the
standard multi-phase model. The primary differences in the observed low
temperature spectra are ascribed to differences in the ambient temperature.

  Clusters, April 2002, Chung-Li, Taiwan",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In many clusters of galaxies, the cooling time at the core of the
intracluster medium is much less than the age of the system, suggesting that
the the gas should continually lose energy by radiation. Simple thermodynamic
arguments then require that the expected ""cooling flow"" should exhibit a
specific spectroscopic signature, characterized by a differential emission
measure distribution that is inversely proportional to the cooling function of
the plasma. That prediction can be quantitatively tested for the first time by
the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) experiment on XMM-Newton, which
provides high resolution X-ray spectra, even for moderately extended sources
like clusters. We present RGS data on 14 separate cooling flow clusters,
sampling a very wide range in mass deposition rate. Surprisingly, in all cases
we find a systematic deficit of low temperature emission relative to the
predictions of the cooling flow models. However, we do see evidence for cooling
flow gas at temperatures just below the cluster background temperature, $T_0$,
roughly down to $T_0/2$. These results are difficult to reconcile with most of
the possible explanations for the cooling flow problem that have been proposed
to date. We also present RGS data on the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 4636. In
this case, we detect evidence for resonance emission line scattering of high
oscillator strength Fe L-shell emission lines within the gaseous halo of the
galaxy. The detection of that effect leads to very tight constraints on
physical conditions within the halo. However, here again, the expected
signature of a cooling flow is not detected, perhaps suggesting some
fundamental uncertainty in our understanding of radiative cooling in low
density cosmic plasmas.

explore two models, which associate this line with (1) the intragroup gas in
the Local Group, and (2) the hot halo gas in the vicinity of our Milky Way. In
the first model, we find that for a standard beta-model of the gas distribution
in the Local Group, the temperature is constrained to 2.3e5 < T < 1.2e6 K and
the baryon overdensity is delta_b ~ 100; both results are consistent with the
properties of the so-called warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) predicted by
cosmological simulations. We also find the core radius of the gas distribution
should be > 100 kpc. In the second model we discuss several possible Galactic
origins for the absorption, and we comment on the possibility that the OVII is
associated with the OVI absorption observed in this direction by the Far
Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). We find that there is a strong
indication that collisional ionization is the dominant ionization source for
the observed absorption.

softness over the full 80 ks observation. The 0.15--3.0 keV spectrum is well
fitted by a single power law with photon index of Gamma = 2.91 +/- 0.03.
Combined with high energy data from BeppoSAX, the spectrum from 0.15 to 10 keV
is well fit as the sum of two power laws with Gamma = 3.03 +/- 0.04, which
dominates below 2 keV and 1.4 +/- 0.2, which dominates above 2 keV (quoting 90%
confidence uncertainties). No significant emission or absorption features are
detected in the high resolution spectrum, supporting our previous findings
using the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer but contradicting the claims of emission
lines by Hwang & Bowyer (1997). There is no evidence of a warm absorber, as
found in the high resolution spectra of many Sy 1 galaxies including others

continuum we test the model proposed by Laming, which invokes bremsstrahlung
from electrons accelerated by lower hybrid plasma waves. The justification for
this model comes from our determination of a lower limit to the average
magnetic field of B > 0.5 mG, which suggest that most of the electron
populations are too much affected by synchrotron losses to produce X-ray
synchrotron emission. An exception is the X-ray emission from the rim
surrounding Cas A, seen in Chandra continuum images. The width of this rim of
1.5"" to 4"", can be used to infer the magnetic field near the shock front, for
which we estimate B = 0.08 - 0.16 mG, and electron energies of about 57 - 40
TeV. This is lower than the average magnetic field, but higher than what may be
expected from shocked interstellar medium, suggesting a high pre-shock magnetic
field, or rapid, post shock, field amplification. Combining the two magnetic
field measurements we have constructed a simple two zone model. Most of the
radio emission comes from inside Cas A, where the magnetic field is strong,
whereas the inverse Compton emission comes from near the shock front. Only for
our lower limit on the magnetic field strength near the shock front is it
possible to explain the recent detection of TeV emission by HEGRA with inverse
Compton, for which, in addition, we have to assume a rather high far infrared
photon density that should be twice as high as our best estimate of roughly 70
cm^{-3}. Pion decay is therefore likely to be the dominant emission from Cas A
at TeV energies.

concentrated in a thin shell near its surface (contact discontinuity). We

acceleration of pairs and causes the $\gamma$-ray emission. At a radius

results were derived from the BATSE earth-occultation database with the JPL
data analysis package, EBOP (Enhanced BATSE Occultation Package). Results
presented here focus primarily on the long-term temporal and spectral
variability of the source emission associated with the outburst. The light
curves with 1-day resolution in six broad energy-bands show the high-energy
flux (>200 keV) led the low-energy flux (<200 keV) by ~5 days in reaching the
primary peak, but lagged the latter by ~7 days in starting the declining phase.
We confirm the ""secondary maximum"" of the low-energy (<200 keV) flux at TJD
8970-8981, ~120 days after the first maximum. Our data show that the ""secondary
maximum"" was also prominent in the 200-300 keV band, but became less pronounced
at higher energies. During this 200-day period, the spectrum evolved from a
power-law with photon index of 1.75 on TJD 8839, to a shape that can be
described by a Comptonized model or an exponential power law below 300 keV,
with a variable power-law tail above 300 keV. The spectrum remained roughly in
this two-component shape until ~9 November (TJD 8935) and then returned to the
initial power-law shape with an index of ~2 until the end of the period. The
correlation of the two spectral shapes with the high and low luminosities of
the soft gamma-ray emission is strongly reminiscent of that seen in Cygnus X-1.
We interpret these results in terms of the Advection Dominated Accretion Flow
(ADAF) model with possibly a ""jet-like"" region that persistently produced the
non-thermal power-law gamma rays observed throughout the event.

quarter elliptical galaxies, two quarters S0 galaxies, and one quarter spiral
galaxies. Observations of clusters at redshift 0.5 show a perspicuously
different ratio, the dominant galaxy type are spiral galaxies with a fraction
of two quarters while the number of S0 galaxies decreases to a fraction of one
quarter (Dressler et al.1997). This shows an evolution of the galaxy population
in clusters since redshift0.5 and it has been suspected that galaxy
transformation processes during the infall into a cluster are responsible for
this change. These could be merging, starburst or ram-pressure stripping. We
use our evolutionary synthesis models to describe various possible effects of
those interactions on the star formation of spiral galaxies infalling into
clusters. We study the effects of starbursts of various strengths as well as of
the truncation of star formation at various epochs on the color and luminosity
evolution of model galaxies of various spectral types. As a first application
we present the comparison of our models with observed properties of the local
S0 galaxy population to constrain possible S0 formation mechanisms in clusters.
Application to other types of galaxies is planned for the future.

conforms to the paradigm of the gravothermal catastrophe, which is expected to
occur (in the presence of adequate energy transport mechanisms) when the
one-parameter equilibrium sequence attains sufficiently high values of the
concentration parameter; these are the values for which the models are well
fitted by the R^(1/4) law. In the intermediate concentration regime the models
belonging to the sequence exhibit significant deviations from the R^(1/4) law.
Curiously, in the low-concentration regime, the global thermodynamical
temperature associated with the models becomes negative when the models become
too anisotropic so that they are unstable against the radial orbit instability;
this latter behavior, while offering a new clue to the physical interpretation
of the radial orbit instability, is at variance with respect to the
low-concentration limit of the classical case of the isotropic, isothermal
sphere investigated by Bonnor (1956) and Lynden-Bell & Wood (1968).

significant soft excess is evident. This soft X-ray excess is compared with the
thermal emission from both the hot intracluster gas and any cooling (flow) gas
that may be present. A warm (kT=0.2 keV), extended (several Mpc), plasma
component is particularly clear in the outer parts of the cluster, where the
normal cluster X-ray emission is weak. This warm component causes both a
thermal soft X-ray excess at low energies (below 0.4-0.5 keV), as well as O VII
line emission with a redshift consistent with a cluster origin, and not easily
interpreted as Galactic foreground emission. The intensity of this component is
commensurate with what has been measured before with the ROSAT PSPC in the 1/4
keV band. We attribute this component to emission from intercluster filaments
of the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium in the vicinity of these clusters. For the
central regions of clusters the detection of lines in the soft X-ray spectrum
is more difficult, due to the predominance of the X-ray emitting hot plasma
there, hence we cannot discriminate between the thermal and nonthermal origin
of the soft excess, leaving several options open. These include thermal
emission from warm filaments seen in projection in front of or behind the
cluster center, thermal or nonthermal emission in the cluster core itself
related to magnetic reconnection, or Inverse Compton emission from the cosmic

species (13CO, HCN, HNC, CN, HCO+ and N2H+) in a sample of compact planetary
nebulae. Some species such as HCO+ and CN are particularly abundant compared to
envelopes around AGB stars or even interstellar clouds. We have estimated the
following average values for the column densities ratios: CN/HCN~2.6,
HCO+/HCN~0.5, and HNC/HCN~0.4. Thus, the chemical composition of the molecular
envelopes in these compact PNe appears somewhat intermediate between the
composition of proto-PNe (such as CRL 2688 or CRL 618) and well evolved PNe
(such as the Ring, M4--9, or the Helix). From observations of the CO
isotopomers, we have estimated that the 12C/13C ratio is in the range 10 ~<
12C/13C ~< 40. These values are below those expected from standard asymptotic
giant branch models and suggest non-standard mixing processes. The observed
molecular abundances are compared to very recent modelling work, and we
conclude that the observations are well explained, in general terms, by
time-dependent gas-phase chemical models in which the ionization rate is
enhanced by several orders of magnitude with respect to the average
interstellar value. Thus, our observations confirm that the chemistry in the
neutral shells of PNe is essentially governed by the high energy radiation from
the hot central stars. The complexity of the chemical processes is increased by
numerous factors linked to the properties of the central star and the geometry
and degree of clumpiness of the envelope. Several aspects of the PN chemistry
that remains to be understood are discussed within the frame of the available

and a weakly-interacting 2D electron gas. We extensively review experiments on
the cuprate high-temperature superconductors which can be analyzed using these
strategies. We adduce evidence that stripe correlations are widespread in the
cuprates. Finally, we compare and contrast the advantages of two limiting
perspectives on the high-temperature superconductor: weak coupling, in which
correlation effects are treated as a perturbation on an underlying metallic
(although renormalized) Fermi liquid state, and strong coupling, in which the
magnetism is associated with well defined localized spins, and stripes are
viewed as a form of micro-phase separation. We present quantitative indicators
that the latter view better accounts for the observed stripe phenomena in the
cuprates.

have a true first-order transition in dimension five. This latter difference

the isotope effects on transition temperature, specific heat and magnetic
penetration depths are not independent, but related by universal relations. The

consistency with these relations. They imply a dominant role of fluctuations so
that pair formation and pair condensation do not occur simultaneously. For this
reason and due to the occurrence of the 2D-XY-QSI transition the isotope
effects do not provide information on the underlying pairing mechanism but must
be attributed to a shift of the phase diagram upon isotope substitution. The
2D-QSI transition is driven by the exchange of pairs, which favors
superconductivity and the combined effects of disorder and Coulomb repulsion of
the pairs, which favor localization. Since isotope substitution will hardly
affect disorder and Coulomb repulsion, the shift of the phase diagram must be
attributed to the electron-phonon interaction, which renormalizes the mass of

transition temperature $T_{c}$ fluctuations dominate and the correlation length
$\xi $ increases strongly when $T_{c}$ is approached. However, for nonzero
magnetic field $H$ there is another length scale $L_{H}=\sqrt{\Phi_{0}/aH}$
where $a$ is a universal amplitude. It is comparable to the average distance
between vortex lines. We show that the correlation length is bounded by this
length scale, so that $\xi $ cannot grow beyond $L_{H}$. This implies that type
II superconductors in a magnetic field do not undergo a phase transition to a
state with zero resistance. We sketch the scaling theory of the resulting
magnetic field induced finite size effect. In contrast to its inhomogeneity
induced counterpart, the magnetic length scale can be varied continuously in
terms of the magnetic field strength. This opens the possibility to assess the
importance of fluctuations, to extract critical point properties of the

often modelled by one-particle Schroedinger operators with random potentials
which are ergodic with respect to the full group of Euclidean translations. We
give a short, reasonably self-contained survey of rigorous results on such
operators, where we allow for the presence of a constant magnetic field. We
compile robust properties of the integrated density of states like its
self-averaging, uniqueness and leading high-energy growth. Results on its
leading low-energy fall-off, that is, on its Lifshits tail, are then discussed
in case of Gaussian and non-negative Poissonian random potentials. In the
Gaussian case with a continuous and non-negative covariance function we point
out that the integrated density of states is locally Lipschitz continuous and
present explicit upper bounds on its derivative, the density of states.
Available results on Anderson localization concern the almost-sure pure-point
nature of the low-energy spectrum in case of certain Gaussian random potentials
for arbitrary space dimension. Moreover, under slightly stronger conditions all
absolute spatial moments of an initially localized wave packet in the
pure-point spectral subspace remain almost surely finite for all times. In case
of one dimension and a Poissonian random potential with repulsive impurities of
finite range, it is known that the whole energy spectrum is almost surely only
pure point.

object based composition of unmodified code modules. Intuitively, the two major
programming models, threads and processes, can be considered as extremes along
a sharing axis. Multiple threads through a process share all global state,
whereas instances of a process (or independent processes) share no global
state. Weaves provide the generalized framework that allows arbitrary
(selective) sharing of state between multiple control flows through a process.
The Weaves framework supports multiple independent components in a single
process, with flexible state sharing and scheduling, all of which is achieved
without requiring any modification to existing code bases. Furthermore, the
framework allows dynamic instantiation of code modules and control flows
through them. In effect, weaves create intra-process modules (similar to
objects in OOP) from code written in any language. The Weaves paradigm allows
objects to be arbitrarily shared, it is a true superset of both processes as
well as threads, with code sharing and fast context switching time similar to
threads. Weaves does not require any special support from either the language
or application code, practically any code can be weaved. Weaves also include
support for fast automatic checkpointing and recovery with no application
support. This paper presents the elements of the Weaves framework and results
from our implementation that works by reverse-analyzing source-code independent
ELF object files. The current implementation has been validated over Sweep3D, a
benchmark for 3D discrete ordinates neutron transport [Koch et al., 1992], and

the scalars. The parameters involving the scalars were previously obtained to
fit the s-wave $\pi\pi$ and $\pi$K scatterings in the region up to about 1 GeV

a large enhancement from diagrams including a light $\sigma(560)$. However
there is an amusing cancellation mechanism which prevents this from occurring.
In the simplest model there is an enhancement of about 13 per cent in the \e3p
decay rate due to the scalars. In a more complicated model which includes
derivative type symmetry breakers, the cancellation is modified and the scalars
contribute about 30 percent of the total decay rate (although the total is not

a reasonable estimate for the related $a_0(980)-f_0(980)$ mixing strength,

the differential geometric and bundle theoretic aspects of G/H, including its
projective modules and complex, Kaehler and Riemannian structures, is presented

transparently shows obstructions to spin- and spin_c-structures. When a
manifold is spin_c and not spin, U(1) gauge fields have to be introduced in a
particular way to define spinors. Likewise, for manifolds like SU(3)/SO(3),
which are not even spin_c, we show that SU(2) and higher rank gauge fields have
to be introduced to define spinors. This result has potential consequences for
string theories if such manifolds occur as D-branes. The spectra and

are constructed by fusing blocks of elementary local face weights. The usual
A-type fusions are labelled by the Kac labels (r, s) and are associated with
the Verlinde fusion algebra. We introduce a new type of fusion in the two braid
limits u->\pm i\infty associated with the graph fusion algebra, and labelled by
nodes $a,b\in G$ respectively. When combined with automorphisms, they lead to
general integrable seams labelled by $x=(r,a,b,\kappa) \in (A_{g-2}, H, H, Z_2
)$ where H is the graph G itself for Type I theories and its parent for Type II
theories. Identifying our construction labels with the conformal labels of
Petkova and Zuber, we find that the integrable seams are in one-to-one
correspondence with the conformal seams. The distinct seams are thus associated
with the nodes of the Ocneanu quantum graph. The quantum symmetries and twisted
partition functions are checked numerically for $|G| \leq 6$. We also show, in
the case of $D_{2l}$, that the non-commutativity of the Ocneanu algebra of
seams arises because the automorphisms do not commute with the fusions.

random K-SAT problem. Specifically, a set of linear constraints C on K
variables is fixed. From a pool of n variables, K variables are chosen
uniformly at random and a constraint is chosen from C also uniformly at random.
This procedure is repeated m times independently. We ask the following
question: is the resulting linear programming problem feasible? We show that
the feasibility property experiences a linear phase transition, when n diverges
to infinity and m=cn for some constant c. Namely, there exists a critical value
c* such that, when c<c*, the system is feasible or is asymptotically almost
feasible, as n increases, but, when c>c*, the ""distance"" from feasibility is at
least a positive constant independent of n. Our results are obtained using

result in the context of sparse random graphs G(n, cn) on n nodes with cn
edges, where edges are equipped with randomly generated weights. Let M(n,c)

realized through the rapid growth of a group of mutualistic mutants with higher

combustion reaction is considered. The transverse profile of the filaments is
investigated numerically and analytically based on a one-dimensional model that
represents the effect of stirring as a convergent flow. The dependence of the
steady solutions on the Damkohler number and Lewis number is treated in detail.
It is found that, below a critical Damkohler number Da(crit), the flame is
quenched by the flow. The quenching transition appears as a result of a
saddle-node bifurcation where the stable steady filament solution collides with
an unstable one. The shape of the steady solutions for the concentration and
temperature profiles changes with the Lewis number and the value of Da(crit)
increases monotonically with the Lewis number. Properties of the solutions are
studied analytically in the limit of large Damkohler number and for small and
large Lewis number.

satisfactory, particularly for large $\Theta_{ab}$ geometries. In view of the
present results, together with the fact that it is capable of describing
unequal-energy-sharing kinematics [35], it may be said that the hyperspherical
partial wave theory is quite appropriate for the description of ionization
events of electron-hydrogen type systems. It is also clear that the present
approach in the implementation of the hyperspherical partial wave theory is
very appropriate.

the thermodynamics follows from that of the harmonic oscillators. Using the
behavior of a harmonic oscillator thermodynamic system under a quasi-static
change of oscillator frequency w, we show that the thermodynamic functions can
all be derived from a single function of w/T, analogous to Wien's displacement
theorem. The high- and low-frequency energy limits allow asymptotic energy
forms involving T alone or w alone, corresponding to energy equipartition and
zero-point energy. It is noted that the Planck spectrum with zero-point

which provides the smoothest possible interpolation between energy
equipartition at low frequency and zero-point energy at high frequency.

spaced across the volume, then the Planck spectrum correspond to that spectrum
of random radiation (having constant energy kT per normal mode at low
frequencies and zero-point energy (1/2)hw per normal mode at high frequencies)
which gives maximum uniformity across the collection of boxes for the radiation

that foreshocks have specific properties that may be used to distinguish them
from other earthquakes have raised the hope that large earthquakes may be
predictable. Among proposed anomalous properties are the larger proportion than
normal of large versus small foreshocks, the power law acceleration of
seismicity rate as a function of time to the mainshock and the spatial
migration of foreshocks toward the mainshock, when averaging over many
sequences. Using Southern California seismicity, we show that these properties
and others arise naturally from the simple model that any earthquake may
trigger other earthquakes, without arbitrary distinction between foreshocks,
aftershocks and mainshocks. We find that foreshocks precursory properties are
independent of the mainshock size. This implies that earthquakes (large or
small) are predictable to the same degree as seismicity rate is predictable
from past seismicity by taking into account cascades of triggering. The
cascades of triggering give rise naturally to long-range and long-time
interactions, which can explain the observations of correlations in seismicity
over surprisingly large length scales.

  In the first (traditional) case, the probability of the process is
proportional to a sum of absolute squares of the amplitudes of the transition

traversing single crystals. In the second case, we begin with calculation of
the sum of amplitudes for transition between states with different transverse
energy levels for corresponding radiation frequency, and then the sum is
squared. One must keep in mind that the latter approach can be used only in the
case when positrons move in a nearly harmonic planar potential with equidistant
transverse energy levels. It is shown that the calculation based on the second
approach can give rise to a peak structure in the spectrum when the number of
transverse energy levels is much greater than one.

superluminal signalling, but allows nonlocality while being fully covariant.
And that is what constitutes the model's value: it is an explicit example of

are streamlined in a close-packed crystalline lattice. Every dynamide is a
neutral pair, consistent by massless opposite point-like elementary electric
charges (ElmElcChrgs): electrino (-) and positrino (+). In an equilibrium
position two contrary Pnt-Lk ElmElcChrgs within every one dynamide are very
closely installed one to another and therefore its aggregate polarization and
its ElcFld also have zero values. However the absence of a mass in a rest of an
electrino and positrino makes possible they to display an infinitesimal
inertness of their own QntElcMgnFlds and a big mobility, what permits them to
be found a bigger time in an unequilibrium distorted position. The aggregate
ElcFld of dynamide reminds us that it could be considered as the QntElcFld of
an electric quasi-dipole because both massless electrino and positrino have the
same inertness. The aggregate ElcFld of every dynamide polarizes nearest
neighbour dynamides in an account of which they interact between them-self, on
account of which their photons display a wave character and behaviour. In order
