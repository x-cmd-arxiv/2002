Our analysis shows that the spurious polarization expected in a PLANCK-like

subgiants clearly exhibit a substantial (a factor of ~ 6) spread in [C/Fe].
Moreover, the bulk of the subgiants possess C abundances larger than those
found among their more luminous counterparts. The turnoff stars themselves are
too warm for appreciable CH formation, but the relatively small range in the
observed CH band strength for stars just below the turnoff nevertheless
translates into this same spread in [C/Fe]. Still fainter, the sample size is
small, but the same range in [C/Fe] appears to be present. On the basis of
these observations we suggest that a process external to the present stars has
resulted in a substantial star-to-star dispersion in [C/Fe] (and possibly other
light elements) among all stars in M13. In addition, the surface C abundances
among the more luminous stars have been further modified by the operation of an
internal deep-mixing mechanism during red giant branch ascent. The amplitude of

explain via accretion from intermediate mass AGB stars as the external

study the spatial distribution and the velocity field of the emitting gas by
performing detailed analyses on the line variability using correlations, 1D and

evidence for two components, one which has the dynamic properties of gas in
Keplerian motion around a black hole with a mass of the order of 10^9 Mo, and
one which is characterized by high, blue-shifted velocities at large lag. There
is no indication of the presence of optically thick emission medium neither in
the Lya, nor in the Civ response functions. The component characterized by
blue-shifted velocities, which is comparatively much stronger in Civ than in
Lya, is more or less compatible with being the result of gas falling towards
the central black hole with free-fall acceleration. We propose however that the
line emission at high, blue-shifted velocities is better explained in terms of
entrainment of gas clouds by the jet. This gas is therefore probably
collisionally excited as a result of heating due to the intense infrared
radiation from the jet, which would explain the strength of this component in
Civ relative to Lya. This phenomenon might be a signature of disk-jet

study of sources of uncertainties in the standard solar model, which must be
understood before the helioseismic observations can be used as constraints on
theory. We find that the largest uncertainty in the sound speed in the solar
interior, namely, 3 parts in 1000, arises from uncertainties in the observed

from (1) the 4% uncertainty in the OPAL opacities, (2) the 5% uncertainty in

investigators have shown that similar uncertainties arise from uncertainties in
the interior equation of state and in rotation-induced turbulent mixing.) The
predicted pre-main-sequence solar lithium depletion is a factor of order 20 (an
order of magnitude larger than that predicted by earlier models that neglected
gravitational settling and used older opacities), and is uncertain by a factor

to 1.07 M_sun; for each mass, we considered three different mass loss
scenarios. We then tested whether these models were consistent with the current
high-precision helioseismic observations. The relatively modest mass loss rates
in these models are consistent with observational limits from young stars and
estimates of the past solar wind obtained from lunar rocks, and do not
significantly affect the solar lithium depletion. For appropriate initial
masses, all three mass loss scenarios are capable of yielding a solar flux 3.8
Gyr ago high enough to be consistent with water on ancient Mars. We find that
all of our mass-losing solar models are consistent with the helioseismic
observations. The early solar mass loss of a few percent does indeed leave a
small fingerprint on the Sun's internal structure. However, for helioseismology
to significantly constrain early solar mass loss would require higher accuracy
in the observed solar parameters and input physics, namely, by a factor of

that bluer elliptical and S0 galaxies have significantly younger populations

this sample with fluctuation magnitudes consistent with old, metal-poor (t>5

We also derive analytical energy and momentum deposition rates via neutrino

simulation the matter is provided around the neutrinosphere before neutrinos
start to be emitted, and the energy is injected during a finite period of time
$t_{\rm dur}$. In the acceleration regime the matter shell is pushed from
behind by radiation pressure. The Lorentz factor of the shell reaches the
maximum value $\eta$ at $r \simeq \eta^2 c t_{\rm dur}$. After the fireball
enters the coasting regime, the velocity distribution in the shell becomes very
flat. The shell expansion rate $d W/dr$ can be much smaller than $\eta^{-2}$.
The runaway of temperature of the fireball due to neutrino scattering with

$\Gamma_{0}=0.50\pm 0.03$ $K$ and the crystalline field amplitude
$V_{0}=0.70\pm 0.10$ $K$ derived from experiment. The two distinct
para-rotational (PR) short-range ordered structures are described in terms of
the local alignment and orientation of the polar principal axis, and are shown
to be due to the interplay between the positive and negative crystalline
fields. It is shown that the observed below the 2D site percolation threshold
$c_{p}=0.72$ local structures are rather different from the ferromagnetic-type
PR ordering suggested earlier by Harris and Berlinsky.

cuprates in collaboration with X.-G. Wen, based on an SU(2) formulation of the
t-J model. In this formulation, the staggered flux state plays a central role
as the progenitor of the Neel state at half-filling and a close competitor to
the d-wave superconductor with small doping where it is characterized by
staggered orbital currents. We found support for this point of view when we
discovered fluctuating orbital currents in the Gutzwiller projected BCS
wavefunction. We shall argue that low-energy vortices, where the staggered flux
state is stabilized in the core, are needed to explain many of the unusual
properties of underdoped cuprates. Proposed experiments to look for these
orbital currents will be discussed.

LISA configuration can be combined by appropriately delaying the data streams
for cancelling the laser frequency noise. Raw laser noise is several orders of
magnitude above the other noises and thus it is essential to bring it down to
the level of shot, acceleration noises. A rigorous and systematic formalism
using the techniques of computational commutative algebra was developed which
generates all the data combinations cancelling the laser frequency noise. The
relevant data combinations form a first module of syzygies. In this paper we
use this formalism for optimisation of the LISA sensitivity by analysing the
noise and signal covariance matrices. The signal covariance matrix, averaged
over polarisations and directions, is calculated for binaries whose frequency
changes at most adiabatically. We then present the extremal SNR curves for all
the data combinations in the module. They correspond to the eigenvectors of the
noise and signal covariance matrices. We construct LISA `network' SNR by
combining the outputs of the eigenvectors which improves the LISA sensitivity
substantially. The maximum SNR curve can yield an improvement upto 70 % over
the Michelson, mainly at high frequencies, while the improvement using the
network SNR ranges from 40 % to over 100 %. Finally, we describe a simple toy
model, in which LISA rotates in a plane. In this analysis, we estimate the
improvement in the LISA sensitivity, if one switches from one data combination
to another as it rotates. Here the improvement in sensitivity, if one switches
optimally over three cyclic data combinations of the eigenvector is about 55 %
on an average over the LISA band-width. The corresponding SNR improvement is 60
%, if one maximises over the module.

are expected to form as a result of stellar gravitational collapse, binary
neutron star merger or disruption, can reach very high rest-mass densities and
behave effectively as neutron stars but with a toroidal topology (i.e.
``toroidal neutron stars''). Our attention is here focussed on the dynamical
response of these objects to axisymmetric perturbations. We show that, upon the
introduction of perturbations, these systems either become unstable to the
runaway instability or exhibit a regular oscillatory behaviour resulting in a
quasi-periodic variation of the accretion rate as well as of the mass
quadrupole. The latter, in particular, is responsible for the emission of
intense gravitational radiation whose signal-to-noise ratio at the detector is
comparable or larger than the typical one expected in stellar-core collapse,
making these new sources of gravitational waves potentially detectable. We
discuss a systematic investigation of the parameter space both in the linear
and nonlinear regimes, providing estimates of how the gravitational radiation
emitted depends on the mass of the torus and on the strength of the
perturbation.

for an unpolarized ensemble of massive gravitinos, would yield the results
3/2^- with probability one half, and 1/2 with probability one half. The latter
is distributed uniformly, i.e. as 1/4, among the two spin-1/2^+ and spin-1/2^-
states of opposite parities. From that we draw the conclusion that the massive
gravitino should be interpreted as a particle of multiple spin. We expect that
a extension of this work to finite-range gravity shall endow the graviton with
spins 0, 1, and 2 components.

two-body interaction matrix elements. The first set consists of the matrix
elements of the FPD6 interaction. The second set have the same T=1 two-body
matrix elements as the FPD6 interaction, but all the T=0 two-body matrix
elements are set equal to zero. Despite the drastic differences between the two
interactions, the spectra they yield are very similar and indeed it is
difficult to say which set gives a better fit to experiment. That the results
for the yrast spectra are insensitive to the presence or absence of T=0
two-body matrix elements is surprising because the only bound two nucleon
system has T=0, namely the deuteron. Also there is the general folklore that
T=0 matrix elements are responsible for nuclear collectivity. Electric
quadrupole transition rates are also examined. It is found that the
reintroduction of T=0 matrix elements leads to an enhancement of B(E2)'s for
lower spin transitions but in some cases for higher spin transitions one gets
another surprising result that there is a small suppression.

spread as time evolves. We show here that, using the nonlinear resonance
between an internal frequency of a system and an external periodic driving, it
is possible to overcome this spreading and build non-dispersive (or
non-spreading) wave-packets which are well localized and follow a classical
periodic orbit without spreading. From the quantum mechanical point of view,
the non-dispersive wave-packets are time periodic eigenstates of the Floquet
Hamiltonian, localized in the nonlinear resonance island. We discuss the
general mechanism which produces the non-dispersive wave-packets, with emphasis
on simple realization in the electronic motion of a Rydberg electron driven by
a microwave field. We show the robustness of such wavepackets for a model
one-dimensional as well as for realistic three dimensional atoms. We consider
their essential properties such as the stability versus ionization, the
characteristic energy spectrum and long lifetimes. The requirements for
experiments aimed at observing such non-dispersive wave-packets are also
considered. We also discuss other related phenomena in atomic and molecular
physics as well as possible further extensions of the theory.
