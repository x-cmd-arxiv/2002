applied to the data to search for dark matter halos of cluster scale; M >=
10^14 solar mass. The reconstructed convergence field is divided by 1-sigma
noise to obtain the signal-to-noise ratio map (S/N-map) of the detection. Local
maxima and minima are searched on the S/N-map and the probability distribution
function (PDF) of the peaks are created to compare with model predictions. We
found excess over noise PDF created from the randomized realization on both
positive and negative sides. Negative peaks imply the presence of voids in the
dark matter distribution and this is the first report of the detection.
Positive peaks, on the other hand, represent the dark matter halos and the
number count of the halos on the 2.1 sq deg image is 4.9 +- 2.3 for S/N > 5
where the Gaussian smoothing radius of the convergence map is 1'. The result is
consistent with the prediction assuming the Press-Schechter mass function and
the NFW halo profile under the cluster normalized CDM cosmology. Although the
present statistics is not enough due to the limited field of view, this work
demonstrates that dark matter halo count via weak lensing is a promising way to
test the paradigm of structure formation and cosmological model.

This parameter was defined using a Principal Component Analysis of the 2dF

the effect of measurement uncertainties. We find that while eta is correlated
with morphological type, there is a large scatter in this relationship. A
tighter empirical relationship is found between eta and the equivalent width of
the Halpha line, suggesting a connection with the relative star formation rate.
We pursue this connection using spectral synthesis models. Using models in
which the star formation history is parameterised in terms of an exponentially
decreasing function of time, we find that there is a tight correlation between
eta and the ratio of the present to the past-averaged rate of star-formation,
often known as the ``birthrate'' parameter b. This correlation also holds in
models with much more complicated star formation histories, generated by a
semi- analytic model of galaxy formation based upon the hierarchical formation
scenario. There are two possible causes for the tight correlations we find
between eta and b in those galaxies with the most complex star formation
histories; Firstly, the spectra themselves may be degenerate to the actual
long-term star formation history of each galaxy in the optical wavelength range
probed by the 2dFGRS. Secondly, the birthrate parameter b may represent a
physically fundamental quality of galaxy halos -- their over-density relative
to the background density. We conclude that the tight connection with b makes
eta a physically meaningful, as well as convenient and robust, statistic for
galaxy parameterisation and classification. (abridged)

Such an outcome appears inevitable, when normalizing to two well determined
observational measurements, namely, the epoch of the final cosmological
reionization at z~6 and the density fluctuations at z~6, which in turn are
tight ly constrained by Lyman alpha forest observations at z~3. These two
observations most importantly fix the product of star formation efficiency and
ionizing photon escape fraction from galaxies at high redshift. To the extent
that the relative star formation efficiencies in gaseous minihalos with H2
cooling and large halos with atomic cooling at high redshift are still unknown,
the primary source for the first reionization could be Pop III stars either in
minihalos or in large halos. We show that gas in minihalos can be cooled
efficiently by H2 molecules and star formation can continue to take place
largely unimpeded throughout the first reionization period, thanks to two new
mechanisms for generating a high X-ray background during the Pop III era, put
forth here. Moreover, an important process for producing a large number of H2
molecules in relic HII regions of Pop III galaxies, first pointed out by
Ricotti, Gnedin, & Shull, is quantified here. It is shown that the Lyman-Werner
background may never build up during the Pop III era. The long cosmological
reionization and reheating history is complex. We discuss a wide range of
implications and possible tests for this new reionization picture. In
particular, Thomson scattering optical depth is increased to 0.10 +- 0.03,
compared to 0.027 for the case of only one rapid reionization at z=6. Upcoming
Microwave Anisotropy Probe observation of the polarization of the cosmic

velocity dispersion profiles within their effective radii and do not show
significant rotation, hence are clearly anisotropic. The dwarf lenticulars,
instead, rotate faster and are, at least partially, supported by rotation. From
optical Lick absorption indices, we derive metallicities and element

correlation between metallicity and luminosity over a wide range: -8> M_B> -22.
The alpha/Fe ratios of our dwarf ellipticals are significantly lower than the
ones of giant elliptical galaxies, which is in agreement with spectroscopy of
individual stars in Local Group dwarf spheroidals. Our results suggest the
existence of a clear kinematic and stellar population dichotomy between dwarf

convergence map reconstruction, cluster detection and $E$ and $B$ power
spectrum estimation using realistic 1 deg^{2} simulations derived from N-body

without artifacts. Detecting clusters using only weak lensing is difficult
because of line of sight contamination and noise, with low completeness if one
desires low contamination of the sample. A power spectrum analysis of the

primary nuclei ratio and the antiproton flux requires artificial breaks in the
diffusion coefficient and the primary injection spectrum suggesting the need

secondary to primary nuclei ratio. The independent evidence for SN activity in

the anisotropy power-spectrum expected for a Galactic dark halo made of cold,
dense gas clouds, including the effects of clustering with a CDM-like mass
spectrum of mini-halo substructure. The power-spectrum displays two peaks: one,
at l~50, is the Poisson noise for the mini-halos, and the second, much larger
and at much higher l, is the Poisson noise of the individual clouds. Because it
appears on small (milli-arcsecond) angular scales, where the instrumental
sensitivity is inevitably very poor, the latter signal is not directly
detectable. By contrast, clusters of cold gas clouds may contribute
significantly to the observed anisotropies if their emission has a grey-body
spectrum. In this case the peak fluctuation, at l~50, amounts to 4/|sin b|
micro-K in the Rayleigh-Jeans limit, and is the dominant Galactic foreground
between 40 and 80 GHz. It will be possible to constrain this foreground

reached and angular momentum is transferred from the superfluid to the crust,

to probe mass distributions on the scale of galaxy clusters. In this paper we
refine the analysis of our survey for large-separation (>5'') lensed FIRST
quasars (Ofek et al. 2001) by estimating the magnification bias and the source
redshift distribution. Finding no large separation lens among 8000 likely
quasars in that sample, implies an upper bound on the lensed fraction of 3.7 x
10^-4 at 95% CL. From a published deep 1.4 GHz radio survey of the Hubble Deep
Field, and corresponding optical searches for faint quasars, we calculate a
lower limit to the `double flux magnification bias' affecting our
radio-optically selected sample, of B>1.1. From the four-colour information in
the SDSS Early Data Release, we calculate the photometric redshift distribution
of a sample of FIRST quasar candidates and compare it with the redshift
distribution from the FIRST Bright Quasar Survey. We find that the median
redshift of the quasars in our sample is about 1.4. With these new results, we
find that for all plausible cosmologies, the absence of lensed quasars in our
survey is consistent with a model based on an empirical, non-evolving, cluster
mass function, where clusters are represented by singular isothermal spheres.
On the other hand, comparison of our results to the lensing predictions of

collaborators recently proposed to couple the system to a critically
fluctuating order parameter mode of either id_{xy}- or is-symmetry. Motivated
by the observation that the energies relevant for the dynamics of this mode are
comparable to the scattering rate induced by even moderate impurity
concentrations, we here generalize the approach to the presence of static
disorder. In the id-case, we find that the coupling to disorder renders the
order parameter dynamics diffusive but otherwise leaves much of the
phenomenology observed in the clean case intact. In contrast, the interplay of
impurity scattering and order parameter fluctuations of is-symmetry entails the
formation of a secondary superconductor transition, with a critical temperature
exponentially sensitive to the disorder concentration.

store and match orders and facilitate trading. In this paper we develop a
microscopic dynamical statistical model for the continuous double auction under
the assumption of IID random order flow, and analyze it using simulation,
dimensional analysis, and theoretical tools based on mean field approximations.
The model makes testable predictions for basic properties of markets, such as
price volatility, the depth of stored supply and demand vs. price, the bid-ask
spread, the price impact function, and the time and probability of filling
orders. These predictions are based on properties of order flow and the limit
order book, such as share volume of market and limit orders, cancellations,
typical order size, and tick size. Because these quantities can all be measured
directly there are no free parameters. We show that the order size, which can
be cast as a nondimensional granularity parameter, is in most cases a more
significant determinant of market behavior than tick size. We also provide an
explanation for the observed highly concave nature of the price impact
function. On a broader level, this work suggests how stochastic models based on
zero-intelligence agents may be useful to probe the structure of market
institutions. Like the model of perfect rationality, a stochastic-zero
intelligence model can be used to make strong predictions based on a compact
set of assumptions, even if these assumptions are not fully believable.

respective quantum critical lines 2D superconductor to insulator (2D-QSI)

model, at variance with empirical results. We also obtain the conditional
distribution of the number and size of sub-sectors in this model. We formulate
and solve an alternative model, based on the assumption that the sector sizes
follow a power-law distribution. We find in this new model both anomalous
scaling of the variance of growth rates and non Gaussian asymptotic
distributions. We give some testable predictions of the two models that would
differentiate them further. We also discuss why the growth rate statistics at

universal law with its fractional power-law dependence of susceptibility on

region around CEP inside which the critical exponent gradually changes from
that of CEP to that of TCP, indicating a crossover of different universality

large as O(1), while the individual branching fractions may be amenable to
detection by ongoing experiments. We conclude that within the MSSM with large

In leading order pQCD, the SSA in the azimuthal distribution of the charged
decay lepton is predicted to be about 0.2 for SLAC kinematics. Our calculations
show that the SSA in the decay lepton distribution is well defined in pQCD: it
is stable both perturbatively and parametrically, and practically insensitive
to theoretical uncertainties in the charm semileptonic decays. Nonperturbative
contributions to the leptonic SSA due to the gluon transverse motion in the
target, heavy quark fragmentation and Fermi motion of the $c$-quark inside the
$D$-meson are predicted to be about 10%. We conclude that measurements of the
azimuthal asymmetry in the secondary lepton distribution would provide a good
test of the applicability of pQCD to open charm production at energies of fixed
target experiments. Our analysis of the SLAC experimental conditions shows that
this SSA can be measured in E160/E161 with an accuracy of about ten percent.

understanding of the many peculiarities associated with massive gravitons,

and the onset of non-linear effects and the breakdown of the effective theory

physics: their cosmology and their holography. We examine the Einstein
equations induced on a general $(n-2)$-brane of arbitrary tension, embedded in
some $n$-dimensional bulk. The brane energy-momentum tensor enters these
equations both linearly and quadratically. From the point of view of a
homogeneous and isotropic brane we see quadratic deviations from the FRW
equations of the standard cosmology. There is also a contribution from a bulk
Weyl tensor. We study this in detail when the bulk is AdS-Schwarzschild or
Reissner-Nordstr\""om AdS. This contribution can be understood holographically.
For the AdS-Schwarzschild case, we show that the geometry on a brane near the
AdS boundary is just that of a radiation dominated FRW universe. The radiation
comes from a field theory that is dual to the AdS bulk. We also develop a new
approach which allows us to consider branes that are not near the AdS boundary.
This time the dual field theory contributes quadratic energy density/pressure
terms to the FRW equations. Remarkably, these take exactly the same form as for
additional matter placed on the brane by hand, with no bulk Weyl tensor.
  We also derive the general equations of motion for a braneworld containing a
domain wall. For the critical brane, the induced geometry is identical to that
of a vacuum domain wall in $(n-1)$-dimensional Einstein gravity. We develop the
tools to construct a nested Randall-Sundrum scenario whereby we have a
``critical'' domain wall living on an anti-de Sitter brane. We also show how to
construct instantons on the brane, and calculate the probability of false
vacuum decay.

fact is a DG-algebra $(M,m_1,m_2)$ with not necessarily associative product
$m_2$ but this nonassociativity is measured by higher homotopies $m_{i>2}$.
Nevertheless such structure arises in the strictly associative situation too,
namely in the homology algebra $H(C)$ of a DG-algebra $C$ with free $H_i(C)$-s,
particularly in the cohomology algebra $H^*(X,\Lambda)$ of a topological space
$X$. It is clear that the $A(\infty)$-algebra $(H^*(X,\Lambda),\{m_i\})$
carries more information than the cohomology algebra $H^*(B,\Lambda)$.
Naturally arises a question when this structure is degenerate, that is when an
$A(\infty)$-algebra $(M, \{m_i\})$ is isomorphic to one with higher operations
$m_i, i\geq 3$ trivial? In this paper we introduce the obstructions for such
degeneracy. Namely, operations $\{m_i\}$ we interpret as Hochschild twisting
cochain $m=m_3+m_4+..., m_i\in C^n(M,M)$ satisfying $\delta m=m\smile_1m$ where
$\smile_1$ is Gerstenhabers product in $C^*(M,M)$. Using the generalized
product $f\smile_1(g_1,...,g_k)$ we define perturbations of Hochschild twisting
cochains (i.e. of $A(\infty)$ structures) and in particular prove that if for a
graded algebra $(M,\mu)$ all Hochschild cohomologies $Hoch^{n,2-n}(M,M)=0$ for
$n\geq3$ then any $A(\infty)$-algebra structure $\{m_i\}$ on $M$ with $m_1=0,
m_2=\mu $, is degenerate.

excitation energy of the primary fragments. For each bombarding energy a
constant value of the excitation energy per nucleon over the whole range of
fragment charge has been found. This value saturates at 3 AMeV for beam
energies 39 AMeV and above. The corresponding secondary evaporated LCP
represent less than 40% of all produced particles and decreases down to 23% for
50 AMeV. The experimental characteristics of the primary fragments are compared

Reasonable agreement between the data and the calculation has been found for

systems on the bridge length, and the dependence of the zero-bias conduction of
molecular wires on wire length are discussed. Both phenomena are controlled by
tunneling across the molecular bridge and are consequently expected to show
exponential decrease with bridge length that is indeed often observed.
Deviations from this exponential dependence for long bridges, in particular a
crossover to a very weak dependence on bridge length were recently observed
experimentally and discussed theoretically in terms of thermal relaxation and
dephasing on the bridge. Here we discuss two other factors that potentially
affect the bridge length dependence of these phenomena. First, in experiments
initiated by an initial preparation of a non-stationary ""donor"" state the
initial energy is not well defined. A small contribution from initially
populated eigenstates that are of mostly bridge-level character may dominate
transmission for long bridges, resulting in weak or no bridge-length
dependence. Secondly, in steady state experiments the distribution of initial
states (for example the Fermi distribution at the electrodes in conduction
experiments) will cause deviations from exponential dependence on wire length
because even a small population in higher energy states will dominate the
transmission through long wires. For the first scenario we show that the
crossover behavior observed for electron transfer in DNA between G and GGG
species separated by AT chains can be largely reproduced just by initial state
effects.
