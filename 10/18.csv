modeling algorithms to recover the parameters defining the gravitational
potential (M/L ratio and black hole mass Mh) in spheroidal stellar systems
using stellar kinematical data. We show that the potential estimation problem
is generically under-determined when applied to long-slit kinematical data of
the kind used in most black hole mass determinations to date. A range of
parameters (M/L, Mh) can provide equally good fits to the data, making it
impossible to assign best-fit values. We illustrate the indeterminacy using a
variety of data sets derived from realistic models as well as published
observations of the galaxy M32. In the case of M32, our reanalysis demonstrates
that data published prior to 2000 are equally consistent with Mh in the range
1.5x10^6-5x10^6 solar masses, with no preferred value in that range. While the
HST/STIS data for this galaxy may overcome the degeneracy in Mh, HST data for
most galaxies do not resolve the black hole's sphere of influence and in these
galaxies the degree of degeneracy allowed by the data may be substantial. We
investigate the effect on the degeneracy of enforcing smoothness
(regularization) constraints. However we find no indication that the true
potential can be recovered simply by enforcing smoothness. For a given
smoothing level, all solutions in the minimum-chisquare valley exhibit similar
levels of noise. These experiments affirm that the indeterminacy is real and
not an artifact associated with non-smooth solutions. (Abridged)

eclipsing, novalike cataclysmic variable, UX UMa, acquired with FUSE. The
time-averaged spectrum is complex and is dominated by overlapping spectral
features. The most prominent features are emission lines of CIII, NIII}, NIV,
and OVI. They are broad (FWHM >= 1800 km/s) and double-peaked with a central
absorption at zero velocity. During eclipse, the spectrum is simpler: the
emission lines remain bright, but the absorption components of the lines and
the weaker features between the emission lines disappear entirely, leaving a
flat continuum. This behavior is also evident in GHRS (1149 -- 1660 A) spectra
that we retrieved from the HST archive. The FUV spectra show flickering on time
scales of several minutes. The flickering is seen primarily in the continuum
and/or the weaker lines rather than in the prominent emission lines. The
orbital light curve has a dip in the FUV flux between orbital phases 0.45 --
0.65, similar to a pre-eclipse dip detected in HST observations. The EWs of the
line absorption features decrease during the dip. We have detected a systematic
wavelength shift of spectral features on the orbital period, but with a phase
lag of ~ 20 degrees, a phenomenon that has been reported at optical
wavelengths. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of
models of an accretion disk with a chromosphere between the disk and the
extended wind. Finally, we note that the observed FUV flux is too low to be
consistent with the temperature and radius of the WD derived by Baptista et al.

ratio of 1, ought to be viewed with skepticism.

of the three Chandra observations made between 2000 June and 2000 September.
For these observations, a source is present that moves in an eastward direction
away from the point source associated with the compact object. The separation
between the new source and the compact object changes from 21.3 arcseconds in
June to 23.4 arcseconds in September, implying a proper motion of 21.2 +/- 7.2
mas/day, a projected separation of 0.31-0.85 pc and an apparent jet velocity
between 0.34 +/- 0.12 and 0.93 +/- 0.32 times the speed of light for a source
distance range of d = 2.8-7.6 kpc. These observations represent the first time
that an X-ray jet proper motion measurement has been obtained for any accretion
powered Galactic or extra-galactic source. While this work deals with the jet
to the east of the compact object, the western jet has also been detected in
the X-ray and radio bands. The most likely scenario is that the eastern jet is
the approaching jet and that the jet material was ejected from the black hole
in 1998. Along with a 1998 VLBI proper motion measurement, the Chandra proper
motion indicates that the eastern jet decelerated between 1998 and 2000. We
present results on the morphology and energy spectrum of the jet. We cannot
definitively determine the X-ray emission mechanism, but a synchrotron origin
is viable and may provide the simplest explanation for the observations.

system, ClassX integrates into a pipeline a network of classifiers and an
engine that searches and retrieves for a given target multi-wavelength
counterparts from the worldwide data storage media. It applies machine learning
methods to `train' different classifiers using different `training' data sets.
In ClassX, each classifier can make its own class (object type) assignment and
is optimized for handling different tasks and/or different object types. A user
would generally select a certain classifier to make, for instance, a most
complete list of candidate QSOs, but a different classifier would be used to
make a most reliable list of candidate QSOs. Still different classifiers would
be selected to make similar lists for other object types. Along with the class
name assignment, a network classifier outputs the probability for a source to
belong to the assigned class as well as probabilities that the source belongs
in fact to other classes. We illustrate the current capabilities of ClassX and
the concept of a classifiers network with the results obtained with classifiers

galaxies in light of the recent proposal that radiative cooling of the
intracluster gas can explain the observations of the `entropy floor' and other
related X-ray observations. We study a family of cooling flow solutions
parameterized by the mass flux rate, and then determine the resulting entropy
and the X-ray luminosity. We find that cooling flows with mass flux rates in
excess of 1000 M_{solar} per yr are required to explain the observations of
entropy and X-ray luminosity. In view of the observed lack of such large flows
in rich clusters, our calculations suggest that heating sources are needed, in
addition to the effect of radiative cooling, to explain the observations.

emission beams. Using this information, coupled with a dipolar field geometry,
we obtain estimates of the height and transverse location in the magnetosphere,
for each of the emitting cones in these pulsars. These results support our
earlier conclusions for PSR B0329+54 in that we find successive outer cones (in
cases of multi-cone pulsars) being emitted at higher altitudes in the
magnetosphere. The range of inferred heights is from ~200 to ~2200 km. The set
of ``active'' field lines from which the conal emissions originate are located
in the region from ~0.22 to ~0.74 of the polar cap radius. At the neutron star
surface, these conal rings map to radii of a few to several tens of meters and
the separation between successive rings is about 10 to 20 meters. We discuss
the implications of these findings for the understanding of the pulsar emission
geometry and for current theories and models of the emission mechanism.

However, the CVn I cloud is characterized by a crossing time of 15 Gyr, and is
thus far from a state of dynamical equilibrium. The large crossing time for the

liquid-crystal transition, as a model for supercooled liquids and glasses.
Below the melting temperature the system can be kept in the metastable liquid
phase, and it displays a dynamic phenomenology analogous to fragile supercooled
liquids, with stretched exponential relaxation, power law increase of the
relaxation time and high fragility index. At an effective spinodal temperature
Tsp the relaxation time exceeds the crystal nucleation time, and the
supercooled liquid loses stability. Below Tsp liquid properties cannot be
extrapolated, in line with Kauzmann's scenario of a `lower metastability limit'
of supercooled liquids as a solution of Kauzmann's paradox. The off-equilibrium
dynamics below Tsp corresponds to fast nucleation of small, but stable, crystal
droplets, followed by extremely slow growth, due to the presence of pinning
energy barriers. In the early time region, which is longer the lower the
temperature, this crystal-growth phase is indistinguishable from an
off-equilibrium glass, both from a structural and a dynamical point of view:
crystal growth has not advanced enough to be structurally detectable, and a
violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) typical of structural
glasses is observed. On the other hand, for longer times crystallization
reaches a threshold beyond which crystal domains are easily identified, and FDT
violation becomes compatible with ordinary domain growth.

dynamics in glassy systems. The characteristic feature of KCMs is that they
have trivial, often non-interacting, equilibrium behaviour but interesting slow
dynamics due to restrictions on the allowed transitions between configurations.
The basic question which KCMs ask is therefore how much glassy physics can be
understood without an underlying ``equilibrium glass transition''. After a
brief review of glassy phenomenology, we describe the main model classes, which
include spin-facilitated (Ising) models, constrained lattice gases, models
inspired by cellular structures such as soap froths, models obtained via
mappings from interacting systems without constraints, and finally related
models such as urn, oscillator, tiling and needle models. We then describe the
broad range of techniques that have been applied to KCMs, including exact
solutions, adiabatic approximations, projection and mode-coupling techniques,
diagrammatic approaches and mappings to quantum systems or effective models.
Finally, we give a survey of the known results for the dynamics of KCMs both in
and out of equilibrium, including topics such as relaxation time divergences
and dynamical transitions, nonlinear relaxation, aging and effective
temperatures, cooperativity and dynamical heterogeneities, and finally
non-equilibrium stationary states generated by external driving. We conclude
with a discussion of open questions and possibilities for future work.

nematic order in our macroscopic hydrodynamic description and allow both
directions to differ in non equilibrium situations. In an homeotropically
aligned sample the nematic director does couple to an applied simple shear,

(but usually small) angle between n and p, which we find to be equivalent to an
effective dilatation of the layers. This effective dilatation leads, above a
certain threshold, to an undulation instability of the layers. We generalize
our earlier approach [Rheol. Acta, vol.39(3), 15] and include the cross
couplings with the velocity field and the order parameters for orientational

processing overhead. Amdahl's law and the Multiprocessing Factor (MPF) are two
scaling models used in industry and academia for estimating multiprocessor
capacity in the presence of this multiprocessor effect. Both models express
different laws of diminishing returns. Amdahl's law identifies diminishing
processor capacity with a fixed degree of serialization in the workload, while
the MPF model treats it as a constant geometric ratio. The utility of both
models for performance evaluation stems from the presence of a single parameter
that can be determined easily from a small set of benchmark measurements. This
utility, however, is marred by a dilemma. The two models produce different
results, especially for large processor configurations that are so important
for today's applications. The question naturally arises: Which of these two
models is the correct one to use? Ignoring this question merely reduces
capacity prediction to arbitrary curve-fitting. Removing the dilemma requires a
dynamical interpretation of these scaling models. We present a physical
interpretation based on queueing theory and show that Amdahl's law corresponds
to synchronous queueing in a bus model while the MPF model belongs to a Coxian
server model. The latter exhibits unphysical effects such as sublinear response

expect a correlated variation of all the coupling constants, and an associated
violation of the equivalence principle. We review some string-inspired
theoretical models which incorporate such a spacetime variation of coupling
constants while remaining naturally compatible both with phenomenological
constraints coming from geochemical data (Oklo; Rhenium decay) and with present
equivalence principle tests. Barring a very unnatural fine-tuning of
parameters, a variation of the fine-structure constant as large as that
recently ``observed'' by Webb et al. in quasar absorption spectra appears to be
incompatible with these phenomenological constraints. Independently of any
model, it is emphasized that the best experimental probe of varying constants

geometry and physics. It describes a geometric structure which is much richer
than the ordinary geometry of spacetime. A Clifford manifold (C-space) consists
not only of points, but also of 1-loops, 2-loops, etc.. They are associated
with multivectors which are the wedge product of the basis vectors, the
generators of Clifford algebra. Within C-space we can perform the so called
polydimensional rotations which reshuffle the multivectors, e.g., a bivector
into a vector, etc.. A consequence of such a polydimensional rotation is that
the signature can change: it is relative to a chosen set of basis vectors.
Another important consequence is that the well known unconstrained Stueckelberg
theory is embedded within the constrained theory based on C-space. The essence
of the Stueckelberg theory is the existence of an evolution parameter which is
invariant under the Lorentz transformations. The latter parameter is
interpreted as being the true time - associated with our perception of the
passage of time.

probability measure of the collection. Answerable covariant questions, then,
correspond to measurable collections of causal sets which are independent of

can be used for such tests of decays of intermediate states (particles or
resonances) in a semi-automated way. Our test consists of two steps. Different
Monte Carlo programs are run; events with decays of a chosen particle are
searched, decay trees are analysed and appropriate information is stored. Then,
at the analysis step, a list of all found decay modes is defined and branching
ratios are calculated for both runs. Histograms of all scalar Lorentz-invariant
masses constructed from the decay products are plotted and compared for each
decay mode found in both runs. For each plot a measure of the difference of the
distributions is calculated and its maximal value over all histograms for each
decay channel is printed in a summary table. As an example of MC-TESTER
application, we include a test with the tau lepton decay Monte Carlo
generators, TAUOLA and PYTHIA. The HEPEVT (or LUJETS) common block is used as
exclusive source of information on the generated events.

  This class of theories includes models of Scherk-Schwarz supersymmetry
breaking and universal extra dimensions. We consider the problem of stabilizing
the volume of the extra dimensions. We find that for a large class of
stabilization mechanisms the field which corresponds to fluctuations of the
volume remains light even after stabilization, and has a mass in the $10^{-3}$
eV range. In particular this is the case if stabilization does not involve
dynamics at scales larger than the cutoff of the higher dimensional Standard
Model, and if the effective theory below the compactification scale is four
dimensional. The mass of this field is protected against large radiative
corrections by the general covariance of the higher dimensional theory and by
the weakness of its couplings, which are Planck suppressed. Its couplings to
matter mediate forces whose strength is comparable to that of gravity and which
can give rise to potentially observable deviations from Newton's Law at
sub-millimeter distances. Current experiments investigating short distance
gravity can probe extra dimensions too small to be accessible to current
collider experiments. In particular for a single extra dimension stabilized by
the Casimir energy of the Standard Model fields compactification radii as small
as 5 inverse TeV are accessible to current sub-millimeter gravity experiments.

appropriate matter and superpotentials on branes, which are also the source of

reduction of the effective string tension $T$ below the constant value $T=m^2$
say that characterizes the simple, longitudinally Lorentz invariant, Goto Nambu
string model in terms of a fixed mass scale $m$ whose magnitude depends on that
of the Higgs field responsible for the existence of the string. Such a
reduction occurs in the standard ""hot"" cosmic string model in which the effect
of thermal perturbations of a simple Goto Nambu model is expressed by the
formula $T^2=m^2(m^2-2\pi\Theta^2/3)$, where $\Theta$ is the string
temperature. A qualitatively similar though analytically more complicated
tension reduction phenomenon occurs in ""cold"" conducting cosmic string models
where the role of the temperature is played by an effective chemical potential
$\mu$ that is constructed as the magnitude of the phase $\phi$ of a bosonic
condensate of the kind whose existence was first proposed by Witten. The
present article describes the construction and essential mechanical properties
of a category of ""warm"" cosmic string models that are intermediate between
these ""hot"" and ""cold"" extremes. These ""warm"" models are the string analogues
of the standard Landau model for a 2-constituent finite temperature superfluid,
and as such involve two independent currents interpretable as that of the
entropy on one hand and that of the bosonic condensate on the other. It is
surmised that the stationary (in particular ring) equilibrium states of such
""warm"" cosmic strings may be of cosmological significance.

point is a generalized Lax matrix instead of usual Lax pair. The generalized
r-matrix structure and Hamiltonian functions are presented on the basis of
fundamental Poisson bracket. It can be clearly seen that various nonlinear
constrained (c-) and restricted (r-) systems, such as the c-AKNS, c-MKdV,
c-Toda, r-Toda, c-Levi, etc, are derived from the reduction of this structure.
All these nonlinear systems have {\it r}-matrices, and are completely
integrable in Liouville's sense. Furthermore, our generalized structure is
developed to become an approach to obtain the algebro-geometric solutions of
integrable NLEEs. Finally, the two typical examples are considered to
illustrate this approach: the infinite or periodic Toda lattice equation and
the AKNS equation with the condition of decay at infinity or periodic boundary.
