Using the objects' measured spectral types and extinctions, we find that most
of our sample (77%+/-15%) possess intrinsic IR excesses, indicative of disks.
Because the excesses are modest, conventional analyses using only IR colors
would have missed most of the sources with excesses. The observed IR excesses
are correlated with Halpha emission, consistent with a common accretion disk
origin. The excesses can be explained by disk reprocessing of starlight alone;
the implied accretion rates are at least an order of magnitude below typical
values for classical T Tauri stars. The observed distribution of IR excesses
suggests the presence of inner disk holes. The disk frequency appears to be
independent of the mass and age. In the same star-forming regions, disks around
brown dwarfs are at least as long-lived (~3 Myr) as disks around the T Tauri
stars. Altogether, the frequency and properties of young circumstellar disks
appear to be similar from the stellar regime down to the substellar and
planetary-mass regime. This provides prima facie evidence of a common origin
for most stars and brown dwarfs.

allowed the physical parameters of the forward shock to be determined. We use
all 6 bursts (980519, 990123, 990510, 991208, 991216, 000418) which are found
to be adiabatic and thus predicted to have a strong reverse shock. We aim to
constrain the hydrodynamic evolution of the reverse shock and the initial bulk
Lorentz factor -- which we found to be between $10^{2}$ and $10^{3}$ and well
above the lower limits derived from the requirement that gamma-ray bursts be
optically thin to high-energy photons. In half of the cases we improve the
description of the early afterglow lightcurves by adding a contribution from
the reverse shock. Modelling of this early emission provides the opportunity to
investigate the immediate surroundings of the burst. For 991216 and 991208, the
expected $1/r^2$ density structure for a stellar wind is not compatible with

dwarf nova systems which are ionized by external irradiation of cosmic rays or
high-energy photons. We find the growth and saturation of the MRI occurs only
in the upper layers of the disk where the magnetic Reynolds number exceeds a
critical value; in the midplane the disk remains queiscent. The vertical
Poynting flux into the ""dead"", central zone is small, however velocity
fluctuations in the dead zone driven by the turbulence in the active layers
generate a significant Reynolds stress in the midplane. When normalized by the
thermal pressure, the Reynolds stress in the midplane never drops below about
10% of the value of the Maxwell stress in the active layers, even though the
Maxwell stress in the dead zone may be orders of magnitude smaller than this.
Significant mass mixing occurs between the dead zone and active layers.
Fluctuations in the magnetic energy in the active layers can drive vertical
oscillations of the disk in models where the ratio of the column density in the
dead zone to that in the active layers is <10. These results have important
implications for the global evolution of a layered disk, in particular there
may be residual mass inflow in the dead layer. We discuss the effects that dust

path into the gravitational abyss of the interior of a black hole is a
progression in time. There is a peculiar region inside a black hole where some

power $Q_{0}$ and central density of the galaxy nucleus $\rho_{0}$ are derived
for a sample of giants with synchrotron ages reliably determined, and compared
with the relevant parameters in a comparison sample of normal-size sources
consisting of 3C, B2, and other sources. Having apparent luminosity (power) $P$
and linear size $D$ of each sample source, $Q_{0}$ and $\rho_{0}$ are fitted
using the dynamical model of Kaiser et al. (1997) but modified by allowing an
evolution of the cocoon axial ratio with time as suggested by Blundell et al.
(1999). In a result, we found that: (i) there is not a unique factor governing
the source size; giants are old sources with high enough jet power evolved in a
relatively low-density environment. The size is dependent, in order of
decreasing partial correlation coefficients, on age; then on $Q_{0}$; next on
$\rho_{0}$, (ii) a number of the sample sources, having similar $Q_{0}$ and
$\rho_{0}$ but different ages and axial ratios (called a `clan'), fit very well
the evolutionary luminosity-size ($P$-$D$) and energy density-total energy
tracks derived from the model for a `fiducial' source with $Q_{0}$ and
$\rho_{0}$ equal to the means of relevant values obtained for the `clan'
members. Therefore, these sources can be considered as `the same' source
observed at different epochs of its lifetime, and hence very useful for an
observational constraint of evolutionary models of the source dynamics, (iii)
in some cases a slow acceleration of the average expansion speed of the cocoon
along the jet axis seems to be present.

symbols of $K$ synchronous users from the received $N$ base-band CDMA signals.
Mathematically, this can be formulated as an inference problem on a complete
bipartite graph. In the research on graphically represented statistical models,
it is known that the belief propagation (BP) can exactly perform the inference
in a polynomial time scale of the system size when the graph is free from
cycles in spite that the necessary computation for general graphs exponentially
explodes in the worst case. In addition, recent several researches revealed
that the BP can also serve as an excellent approximation algorithm even if the
graph has cycles as far as they are relatively long. However, as there exit
many short cycles in a complete bipartite graph, one might suspect that the BP
would not provide a good performance when employed for the multiuser detection.
  The purpose of this paper is to make an objection to such suspicion. More
specifically, we will show that appropriate employment of the central limit
theorem and the law of large numbers to BP, which is one of the standard
techniques in statistical mechanics, makes it possible to develop a novel
multiuser detection algorithm the convergence property of which is considerably
better than that of the conventional multistage detection without increasing
the computational cost significantly. Furthermore, we will also provide a
scheme to analyse the dynamics of the proposed algorithm, which can be

that if parton saturation sets in at sufficiently small energy, then in

N_{part}. Our results provide a possible explanation of both the absence of
apparent jet quenching at SPS energies and its presence at RHIC. Under the same

may be called asymptotic disappearance (or discretization) of space-time (ADST)

the 3d, which is shown to be possible for both gauge theory and gravity,
including the standard model. To examine the validity of the scenario, 4d QED
generated from its 3d version at high energy is studied, in which one spatial
dimension is discretized with a lattice constant $a$. From the LEP2 experiment
on $e^+ e^- \to \gamma \gamma$, $a$ is constrained to satisfy $a \le 461$ GeV.
Expected bound on $a$ at future $e^+ e^-$ linear collider is discussed. The
finite size of $a$ modifies the dispersion relation, causing the violation of
Lorentz symmetry. Then, the paradox of observing 20 TeV $\gamma$ rays from the

provide different examples of its behavior, showing how it can be useful to
characterize various kind of weakly chaotic dynamics. We also provide criteria
to find systems with non trivial orbit complexity (systems where the
description of the whole orbit requires an infinite amount of information). We
consider also a global indicator of the complexity of the system. This global
indicator generalizes the topological entropy, taking into account systems were
the number of essentially different orbits increases less than exponentially.
Then we prove that if the system is constructive (roughly speaking: if the map
can be defined up to any given accuracy using a finite amount of information)
the orbit complexity is everywhere less or equal than the generalized
topological entropy. Conversely there are compact non constructive examples
where the inequality is reversed, suggesting that this notion comes out
naturally in this kind of complexity questions.

particle energies from 10 MeV to 800 GeV and have compared our results with
predictions of other current models used by the nuclear community. Here, we
present a brief description of our codes and show illustrative results to show
that CEM2k and LAQGSM can be used as reliable event generators for
space-radiation-shielding, cosmic-ray-propagation, and other astrophysical
applications. Finally, we show the use of our calculated cross sections
together with experimental data from our LANL T-16 compilation to produce
evaluated files which we use in the GALPROP model of galactic particle
propagation to better constrain the size of the CR halo.

asymmetry of time reversal can be naturally introduced into classical
statistical mechanics after retarded electromagnetic interaction between
charged microparticles is considered. In this way, the rational dynamic
foundation for classical statistical physics can established and the revised
Liouville equation is obtained. The micro-canonical ensemble, the canonical
ensemble, the distribution of near-independent subsystem, the distribution law
of the Maxwell- Boltzmann and the Maxwell distribution of velocities are
achieved directly from the Liouville equation without using the hypothesis of
equal probability. The micro-canonical ensemble is considered unsuitable as the
foundation of equivalent state theory again, for most of equivalent states of
isolated systems are not the states with equal probabilities actually. The
reversibility paradoxes in the processes of non-equivalent evolutions of
macro-systems can be eliminated completely, and the united description of
statistical mechanics of equivalent and nonequivalent states is reached. The
revised BBKGY series equations and hydromechanics equations are reduced, the
non-equivalent entropy of general systems is defined and the principle of
entropy increment of the non-equivalent entropy is proved at last.

multiple quantum ``coins'' in order to diminish the effects of interference
between paths. We find solutions to this system in terms of the single coin
random walk, and compare the asymptotic limit of these solutions to numerical
simulations. We find exact analytical expressions for the time-dependence of
the first two moments, and show that in the long time limit the ``quantum

is generic for a very broad class of possible walks, and that this behavior
disappears only in the limit of a new coin for every step of the walk.
