(MHD) method designed for studying disk accretion to a rotating magnetized star
in the general case where the star's rotation axis, its magnetic moment, and
the normal to the disk all have different directions. The numerical method uses
a ""cubed sphere"" coordinate system which has advantages of Cartesian and
spherical coordinate systems but does not have the singular axis ofthe
spherical system. The grid is formed by a sequence of concentric spheres of
radii $R_j \propto q^j$ with $j=1..N_R$ and $q={\rm const}>1$. The grid on the
surface of the sphere consists of six sectors with the grid on each sector
topologically equivalent to the equidistant grid on the face of a cube.
Simulation results are discussed for the funnel flows (FF) to a star with
dipole moment $\rvecmu$ at an angle $\Theta=30^\circ$ to the star's rotation
axis ${\bf \Omega}$ which is aligned with the normal to the disk. Two important
new 3D features are found in these simulations: (1) The funnel flow to the
stellar surface is mainly in two streams which approach the star from opposite
directions. (2) In the $x-z$ cross section of the flow containing $\rvecmu$ and
${\bf \Omega}$, the funnel flow often takes the longer of the two possible
paths along magnetic field lines to the surface of the star. A subsequent paper
will give a detailed description of the method and results on 3D funnel flows
at different inclination angles $\Theta$.

grid. The nested grid consists of uniform grids having different grid spacing
and is designed to cover the space closer to the center with a finer grid. Thus
our numerical method is suitable for computing the gravity of a centrally
condensed object. It consists of two parts: the difference scheme for the
Poisson equation on the nested grid and the multi-grid iteration algorithm. It
has three advantages: accuracy, fast convergence, and scalability. First it
computes the gravitational potential of a close binary accurately up to the
quadraple moment, even when the binary is resolved only in the fine grids.
Second residual decreases by a factor of 300 or more by each iteration. We
confirmed experimentally that the iteration converges always to the exact
solution of the difference equation. Third the computation load of the
iteration is proportional to the total number of the cells in the nested grid.
Thus our method gives a good solution at the minimum expense when the nested
grid is large. The difference scheme is applicable also to the adaptive mesh
refinement in which cells of different sizes are used to cover a domain of
computation.

between model results and ``key'' observational constraints allows us to choose
the best set of stellar yields. Once the best set of yields is identified for
the Milky Way, we apply the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions to other spirals
(in particular M101) and dwarf irregular galaxies. We compare our model
predictions with the [C,N,O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H], log(C/O) vs. 12+ log(O/H), log(N/O)
vs. 12+ log(O/H) and [C/O] vs. [Fe/H] relations observed in the solar vicinity,
along the disk and in other galaxies. By taking into account the results
obtained for all the studied galaxies (Milky Way, M101, dwarf galaxies and

properly interpreted, there is no compelling evidence for requiring the
production of primary N in massive stars (M>10Msun); b) both C and N we see
today in the ISM come mainly from low- and intermediate-mass stars. In
particular, there is no need to invoke strong stellar winds in massive stars in
order to explain the evolution of C/O ratio in the solar neighborhood, as often

single-detector Michelson interferometer operating with narrow bandwidth at
center wavelength lambda is limited in its field of view to the primary beam of
the individual telescope apertures, or ~lambda/d radians, where d is the
telescope diameter. Such a field is too small for many applications; often one
wishes to image extended sources. We are developing and testing techniques
analogous to the mosaicing method employed in millimeter and radio astronomy,
but applicable to optical/IR Michelson interferometers, in which beam
combination is done in the pupil plane. An Npix x Npix array detector placed in

perturb terrestrial planets outside of their habitable zone, the orbital region
allowing the existence of liquid water. We quantify the dynamical habitability
of 85 known extrasolar planetary systems via simulations of their orbital
dynamics in the presence of potentially habitable terrestrial planets. When
requiring that habitable planets remain strictly within their habitable zone at
all time, the perturbing influence of giant planets extends beyond the
traditional Hill sphere for close encounters: terrestrial planet excursions
outside of the habitable zone are also caused by secular eccentricity
variations and, in some cases, strong mean-motion resonances. Our results
indicate that more than half the known extrasolar planetary systems (mostly
those with distant, eccentric giant planets) are unlikely to harbor habitable
terrestrial planets. About 1/4 of the systems (mostly those with close-in giant
planets), including 1/3 of the potential targets for the Terrestrial Planet
Finder, appear as dynamically habitable as our own Solar System. The influence
of yet undetected giant planets in these systems could compromise their

have substantial eccentricities (e > 0.1) which may lead to large seasonal
climate variations and thus affect their habitability.

``7 pillars of Inflation'' that can be shown with the CMB probe, and at least
5, and possibly 6, of these have already been demonstrated in the CMB data: (1)
a large scale gravitational potential; (2) acoustic peaks/dips; (3) damping due
to shear viscosity; (4) a Gaussian (maximally random) distribution; (5)
secondary anisotropies; (6) polarization. A 7th pillar, anisotropies induced by

set, \omega_b,\omega_{cdm}, \Omega_{tot}, \Omega_Q,w_Q,n_s,\tau_C, \sigma_8},

\Omega_Q \approx 0.68 \pm 0.05, and CMB+LSS \Omega_Q values are compatible with
the independent SN1 estimates. The dark energy equation of state, crudely
parameterized by a quintessence-field pressure-to-density ratio w_Q, is not
well determined by CMB+LSS (w_Q < -0.4 at 95% CL), but when combined with SN1
the resulting w_Q < -0.7 limit is quite consistent with the w_Q=-1 cosmological

synthetic photometry, and assuming a true distance modulus of 12.13 +/- 0.15
mag and a colour excess of E(B-V) = 0.179, we derive a radius of 1.60 +/- 0.17
solar radii and an effective temperature of 5410 +/- 50 K, implying a
luminosity of 2.0 +/- 0.4 solar luminosities (1 sigma errors). These properties
make it similar to the so-called `sub-subgiants' in the old open cluster M67
and `red stragglers' in 47 Tuc, which have luminosities comparable to those of
turn-off stars, but cooler temperatures and larger radii. The light curve of
the companion is well described by ellipsoidal variations, and despite the
incomplete (~60%) phase coverage, we are able to derive good constraints on a
number of the system parameters. In particular, for the inclination we find a 2
sigma lower limit of i > 48 deg (i > 46 deg at 3 sigma). Assuming a pulsar mass
of 1.2 M_MSP < 2.4 solar masses, this implies a companion mass in the range
0.14 < M_comp < 0.38 solar masses. Combined with the photometric constraint, we
find a best fit for i ~ 50 deg and M_comp ~ 0.3 solar masses. We infer a Roche
lobe filling factor by radius of ~97%. [Abstract shortened]

its harmonics in the Fourier transform. For the majority of binary radio
pulsars or Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs), large numbers of sidebands are
present, allowing efficient searches using Fourier transforms of short portions
of the original power spectrum. Analysis of the complex amplitudes and phases
of the sidebands can provide enough information to solve for the Keplerian

to be geometrically thick and oriented roughly orthogonal to the jets, but it
is patchy.
  HI VLBI shows atomic gas in front of the approaching as well as the receding

to the AGN environment. The ""high velocity system"", 125 to 200 km/s redward of
systemic, seems restricted to a shell 1 to 2 pc away from the core. Closer to
the centre, this gas might be largely ionised; it could cause the free-free
absorption.

atomic ``high velocity'' gas; the connection to H2O masing gas is unclear.
Further, at ``high velocity'' we detected the OH 1612 MHz satellite line in
absorption and the 1720 MHz line in emission, with complementary strengths.

amounts of molecular gas ($3.1 \times 10^9$ \msun and $7 \times 10^8$ \msun,
respectively), covering an extended area (between 15 and 25 kpc). In both
regions the CO clouds have different properties and may be of a distinct
nature. The integrated CO line of SQ A is in particular much wider than in SQ
B. Its CO spectrum shows emission at two velocities (6000 and 6700 \kms),
coincident with two HI lines, with the stronger emission at 6000 \kms being
very smoothly distributed without a distinct peak in the starburst region. In
SQ B the CO emission coincides with that of tracers of star formation (\halpha,
near-infrared 15 $\mu$m and radio continuum). The CO peak lies close to the HI
peak towards a steep HI gradient. This is indicating that the molecular gas is
forming in-situ, with subsequent star formation taking place. The star forming

$S_{\rm floor}$ in groups/clusters at any given redshift are completely
determined by the conservation of energy. In combination with the equation of
hydrostatic equilibrium and the universal density profile for dark matter, this
allows us to derive the remaining gas distribution of groups and clusters after
the cooled material is removed. Together with the Press-Schechter mass function
we are able to evaluate effectively how radiative cooling can modify the
predictions of SZ cluster counts and power spectrum. It appears that our
analytic results are in good agreement with those found by hydrodynamical
simulations. Namely, cooling leads to a moderate decrease of the predicted SZ
cluster counts and power spectrum as compared with standard scenario. However,
without taking into account energy feedback from star formation which may
greatly suppress cooling efficiency, it is still premature to claim that this
modification is significant for the cosmological applications of cluster SZ
effect.

the map obtained by summing independent measurement channels (signal plus noise
map) and for a comparison map (noise only map) obtained by differencing the
same channels. The anisotropy areas (spots) have been identified for both maps
for various temperature thresholds and a catalog of the spots has been
produced. The orientation (obliquity) of the spots is random for both maps. We
computed the mean elongation of spots obtained from the maps at a given
temperature threshold using a simple estimator. We found that for the sum map
there is a region of temperature thresholds where the average elongation is not
dependent on the threshold. Its value is ~ 2.3 for cold areas and ~ 2.2 for hot
areas. This is a non-trivial result. The bias of the estimator is less than 0.4
for areas of size less than 30', and smaller for larger areas. The presence of
noise also biases the ellipticity by less than 0.3. These biases have not been
subtracted in the results quoted above. The threshold independent and random
obliquity behaviour in the sum map is stable against pointing reconstruction
accuracy and noise level of the data, thus confirming that these are actual
properties of the dataset. The data used here give a hint of high ellipticity
for the largest spots. Analogous elongation properties of CMB anisotropies had

and cosmological arrows of time, which can be traced via the properties of
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. We show that in the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe with negative curvature there is a
necessary ingredient for the existence of the thermodynamical arrow of time. It
is based on the dynamical instability of motion along null geodesics in a
hyperbolic space. Together with special (de-correlated) initial conditions,
this mechanism is sufficient for the thermodynamical arrow, whereas the special
initial conditions alone are able to generate only a pre-arrow of time. Since
the negatively curved space will expand forever, this provides a direct
connection between the thermodynamical and cosmological arrows of time. The
structural stability of the geodesic flows on hyperbolic spaces and hence the
robustness of the proposed mechanism is especially stressed. We then point out
that the main relations of equilibrium statistical thermodynamics (including
the second law) do not necessarily depend on any arrow of time. Finally we
formulate a {\it curvature anthropic principle}, which stipulates the negative
curvature as a necessary condition for the time asymmetric Universe with an
observer. CMB has to carry the signature of this principle as well.

from 3 keV to about 9 keV, but can be traced up to 14 keV in some cases, and
has an average duration of 131(+-103) seconds at 7-8 keV. The duration
increases with decreasing photon energy. The peak count rate defined by
cross-correlation is delayed at low energies. The temperature peaks early in
the event and then decreases, whereas the emission measure increases throughout
the event. The properties are consistent with thermal conduction dominating the
evolution. In some of the bigger events, a second component was found in the
11-14 keV range extending down to 8 keV in some cases. The duration is
typically 3 times shorter and ends near the peak time of the thermal component
consistent with the Neupert effect of regular flares. Therefore the second
component is suggested to be of non-thermal origin, presumably causing the
beam-driven evaporation of the first component. The two components can be

antipodal hypotheses -- the monolithic-collapse and the accretion/merger
scenarios. Empirical data on the stellar contents of galaxy halos is crucial in
order to develop galaxy formation and assembly scenarios which have their root
in observations, rather than in numerical simulations. Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) has enabled us to study directly individual stars in the nearby E/S0
galaxies Cen A, NGC 3115, NGC 5102, and NGC 404. We here present and discuss
HST single-star photometry in V and I bands. Using color-magnitude diagrams and
stellar luminosity functions, we gauge the galaxies' stellar contents. This can
be done at more than one position in the halo, but data with deeper limiting
magnitudes are desired to quantify the variation of metallicity with
galactocentric radius. We here compare the color distributions of red giant
stars with stellar isochrones, and we intercompare the galaxies' halo
populations, noting that their total absolute V magnitudes cover the range from
about -21.5 to -17.5. In the future, we plan to model the stellar metallicity
distributions with the aim to constrain chemical enrichment scenarios, a step
towards unravelling the evolutionary history of elliptical and lenticular
galaxies.

  In the present work, we study some consequences of this non-gaussian model on
the rate P at which p-modes are excited in intermediate mass stars (1 Mo < M <
2 Mo). The non gaussian model changes substantially the spectrum of P at high
frequency compared with the commonly assumed gaussian model. The largest
effects on P are found for stars in the mass range ~ 1.5-1.6 Mo. They are found
large enough that observatins in solar-like oscillating stars observed with

such an approach is very successful in reproducing the statistical properties

a function of galaxy type: for clarity, we restrict ourselves to two categories

disks. In our model, irregulars are simply an early stage of galaxy formation.
In particular, we obtain good matches for the galaxy counts and redshift
distributions of sources from UV to submm wavelengths. We also reproduce the
observed cosmic star formation history and the diffuse background radiation,
and make predictions as to the epoch and wavelength at which the dust-shrouded
star formation of spheroids begins to dominate over the star formation that
occurs more quiescently in disks. A new prediction of our model is a rise in
the FIR luminosity density with increasing redshift, peaking at about $z\sim

of deciding whether a simple non-self-intersecting wire structure (a

years and has only recently been solved in the affirmative.
  If we impose some of the constraints that are imposed by the manufacturing
process, we obtain quite different results. In particular, we study the variant
of the carpenter's ruler problem in which there is a restriction that only one
joint can be modified at a time. For a linkage that does not self-intersect or
self-touch, the recent results of Connelly et al. and Streinu imply that it can
always be straightened, modifying one joint at a time. However, we show that
for a linkage with even a single vertex degeneracy, it becomes NP-hard to
decide if it can be straightened while altering only one joint at a time. If we
add the restriction that each joint can be altered at most once, we show that
the problem is NP-complete even without vertex degeneracies.
  In the special case, arising in wire forming manufacturing, that each joint
can be altered at most once, and must be done sequentially from one or both
ends of the linkage, we give an efficient algorithm to determine if a linkage
can be straightened.

1999. This article focuses on the precision measurement of the direct CP
violation parameter Re($\epsilon' / \epsilon$) using the 1996-97 data set. In
addition, measurements of the neutral kaon parameters $\tau_S$, $\Delta m$,
$\phi_{+-}$, $\Delta \phi$ from that data set and a new measurement of the
branching fraction of $K_L \to e^+ e^- \mu^+ \mu^-$ from the 1997 and 1999 data

term between the standard vector coupling of the left-handed neutrinos and

vanish in the limit of massless neutrino. This additional contribution,
including information about the transverse components of neutrino polarization,
generates the azimuthal asymmetry in the angular distribution of the recoil

Lett","Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 130401 (2003)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.130401",,"quant-ph",,"  We propose a scheme for creating quantum superposition states involving of
order $10^{14}$ atoms via the interaction of a single photon with a tiny
mirror. This mirror, mounted on a high-quality mechanical oscillator, is part
of a high-finesse optical cavity which forms one arm of a Michelson
interferometer. By observing the interference of the photon only, one can study
the creation and decoherence of superpositions involving the mirror. All
experimental requirements appear to be within reach of current technology.

two parties who share an arbitrary pure state of $N$ indistinguishable
particles. We show that $E_P \leq E_M$, where $E_M$ is the bipartite
entanglement calculated from the mode-occupation representation. Unlike $E_M$,
$E_P$ is {\em super-additive}. For example, $E_P =0$ for any single-particle
state, but the state $\ket{1}\ket{1}$, where both modes are split between the
two parties, has $E_P = 1/2$. We discuss how this relates to quantum
correlations between particles, for both fermions and bosons.

considered on x in ($-\infty,+\infty$). We establish elementary Darboux
transformations covariance of the problem and analyze its combinations. We
select a second covariant equation to form Lax pair of a coupled KdV-MKdV
system. The sequence of the elementary Darboux transformations of the
zero-potential seed produce two-parameter solution for the coupled KdV-MKdV
system with reductions. We show effects of parameters on the resulting
solutions (reality, singularity). A numerical method for general coupled
KdV-MKdV system is introduced. The method is based on a difference scheme for
Cauchy problems for arbitrary number of equations with constants coefficients.
We analyze stability and prove the convergence of the scheme which is also
tested by numerical simulation of the explicit solutions.

generalized protocol for entanglement swapping using non-maximally entangled
