first the dark matter halo of the close spiral galaxy M31 is modeled from

before the start of the next cycle. We have obtained three nights of echelle
data for this star over about 5 pulsation cycles (P = 0.201 days) in order to
evaluate the effects of on a number of important lines in the spectrum,
including the HeI 5875A and 6678A lines. These data were supplemented by
archival high-dispersion IUE (UV) data from 1994. A comparison of profiles of
the two HeI lines during the peak of the infall activity suggests that
differences in the development of the blue wing at this time are due to heating
and short-lived formations of an optically thin layer above the atmospheric
region compressed by the infall. This discovery and the well-known decreases in
equivalent widths of the CII 6578-83A doublet at the two shock phases, suggests
that shock flattens the temperature gradient and produces heating in heating
the upper atmosphere. Except for absorptions in the blue wings of the UV
resonance lines, we find no evidence for sequential shock delays arriving at
various regions of line formation of the photosphere (a ""Van Hoof effect"").
Phase lags cited by some former observers may be false indicators arising from
varying degrees of desaturation of multiple lines, such as for the red HeI
lines. In addition, an apparent lag in the equivalent width curve of lines
arising from less excited atomic levels could instead be caused by post-shock
cooling, followed by a rebound shock.

stars. We revise He-burning stellar models, with particular attention to core
convection and to its connection with the nuclear reactions powering energy
generation and chemical evolution Theoretical results are compared to the
available measurements for the variable white dwarf GD 358, which indicate a
rather large abundance of central oxygen. We show that the attempt to constrain
the relevant nuclear reaction rate by means of the white dwarf composition is
faced with a large degree of uncertainty related to evaluating the efficiency
of convection-induced mixing.By combining the uncertainty of the convection
theory with the error on the relevant reaction rate we derive that the present
theoretical prediction for the central oxygen mass fraction in white dwarfs
varies between 0.3 and 0.9. Unlike previous claims, we find that models taking
into account semiconvection and a moderate C12(alpha,gamma)O16 reaction rate
are able to account for a high central oxygen abundance. The rate of the
C12(alpha,gamma)O16 used in these models agrees with the one recently obtained
in laboratory experiments (Kunz et al. 2002). On the other hand, when
semiconvection is inhibited, as in the case of classical models (bare
Schwarzschild criterion) or in models with mechanical overshoot, an extremely
high rate of the C12(\alpha,\gamma)O16 reaction is needed to account for a
large oxygen production. Finally, we show that the apparent discrepancy between
our result and those reported in previous studies depends on the method used to
avoid the convective runaways (the so called breathing pulses), which are
usually encountered in modeling late stage of core He-burning phase.

environment on the star-formation activity of galaxies within the EDR of the
SDSS. We have used the Halpha emission line to derive the star-formation rate
(SFR) for each galaxy within a volume-limited sample of 8598 galaxies with 0.05
< z < 0.095 and M(r)<= -20.45. We find that the SFR of galaxies is strongly
correlated with the local (projected) galaxy density and thus we present here
the density-SFR relation that is analogous to the density-morphology relation.
The effect of density on the SFR of galaxies is seen in three ways. First, the
overall distribution of SFRs is shifted to lower values in dense environments
compared with the field population. Second, the effect is most noticeable for
the strongly star-forming galaxies in the 75th percentile of the SFR
distribution. Third, there is a ``break'' (or characteristic density) in the
density-SFR relation at a local galaxy density of 1h-2 Mpc-2. To understand
this break further, we have studied the SFR of galaxies as a function of
clustercentric radius from 17 clusters and groups objectively selected from the
SDSS EDR data. The distribution of SFRs of cluster galaxies begins to change,
compared with the field population, at a clustercentric radius of 3-4 virial
radii, which is consistent with the characteristic break in density that we
observe in the density-SFR relation. Our tests suggest that the
density-morphology relation alone is unlikely to explain the density-SFR
relation we observe. Taken all together, these works demonstrate that the
decrease in SFR of galaxies in dense environments is a universal phenomenon
over a wide range in density (from 0.08 to 10h-2 Mpc-2) and redshift (out to z
= 0.5).

N(MgII). (2) Power-law fits to the distributions of N(MgII), N(FeII), and

km/s for MgI. The clouds are consistent with being thermally broadened, with
temperatures in the 30-40,000K range. (4) A two-component Gaussian model to the
velocity two-point correlation function yielded velocity dispersions of 54 km/s
and 166 km/s. The narrow component has roughly twice the amplitude of the
broader component. The width and amplitude of the broader component decreases
as equivalent width increases. (5) From photoionization models we find that the

the fraction of AGN in the sample as a function of far-IR luminosity but our

may be masked. As a whole the Seyfert galaxies exhibit a small, but
significant, radio excess on the radio-FIR correlation compared to the galaxies
classified as starbursts. Compact (<0.05'') radio cores are detected in 55% of
the Seyfert galaxies, and these galaxies exhibit a significantly larger radio
excess than the Seyfert galaxies in which cores were not detected. Our results
indicate that there may be two distinct populations of Seyferts,
``radio-excess'' Seyferts, which exhibit extended radio structures and compact
radio cores, and ``radio-quiet'' Seyferts, in which the majority of the radio
emission can be attributed to star-formation in the host galaxy. No significant
difference is seen between the IR and optical spectroscopic properties of

out to think that the inconsistencies among the observed properties of large

means of successive accretions of the latter. However, theorists of
hierarchical galaxy formation suggested that present--day dwarfs are not
representative of the galactic building blocks, which may be completely
invisible nowadays. Some of them suggested that, contrary to what is usually
assumed in hierarchical modelling, the actual building blocks were still fully
gaseous systems when their major mergers occurred. If this is the case, then
most of the inconsistencies can be overcome, and the scenario of hierarchical
galaxy formation becomes not too different from that of a slow gas accretion.

model of amorphous and oxygenated hydrocarbon macromolecule (about 500

About 4.5 eV of potential energy is then deposited locally by perturbing one of
the C-H peripheral bonds, thus simulating the capture of a free H atom by a
dangling C bond. The ensuing relaxation of the system is followed for up to 300
ps, using a molecular mechanics code. When steady state is reached, spectra and
time correlation functions of kinetic energy and bond length fluctuations
indicate that most normal modes have been activated, but the motion remains
quasi-periodic or regular. By contrast, when the molecule is violently excited
or embedded in a thermal bath (modelled by Langevin dynamics), the same markers
clearly depict chaotic motions. Thus it appears that even such a large system
of oscillators is unable to provide the equivalent of a thermal bath to any one
of these, unless there are strong resonances between some of them. In general,
therefore, an energy of a few eV's deposited in an isolated molecule will not
be immediately thermalized. This conclusion is of consequence for the

radius and lens trajectories. We include the effect of limb darkening and spot
projection as a function of position on the stellar disc. In particular we
apply the updated, state-of-the-art NEXTGEN stellar atmosphere models of
Hauschildt et al which predict very strong limb darkening and which are likely
to be applicable to the source stars considered here. Our results indicate that
star spots generally give a clear signature for transit events. Moreover, this
signature is strongly suppressed by limb darkening for spots close to the limb,
although the spots may still be clearly detected for favourable lens
trajectories. It is also clear that intensive temporal sampling throughout the
duration of the transit is necessary in order for such events to be effective
as a tool for imaging stellar photospheres. Nonetheless, with sufficiently well
sampled light curves of good photometric precision, microlensing can indeed
place useful constraints on the presence or otherwise of photospheric

factor $\sqrt{\ell/\xi_{0}}$, when the mean free path $\ell$ becomes smaller
than the BCS coherence length $\xi_{0}$, which is in agreement with
experimental findings. In addition, for a superconductor in a crystalline state
in the presence of magnetic impurities the superconducting transition
temperature $T_{c}$ drops sharply from about 50% of $T_{c0}$ (for a pure

occurs in granular materials for plastic (irreversible) deformations that occur

\Omega, leads to an increase in the stress and the stress fluctuations that at

Increases in \Omega also lead to qualitative changes in the distributions of
stress build-up and relaxation events. If shearing is stopped at t=0, stress

weak residual interaction between composite fermions will play a crucial role
in the establishment of such quantum Hall states by opening a gap in a

composite fermions, we develop a powerful method that allows us to obtain the
low energy spectra at composite fermion fillings of $\nu^*=n+\bar \nu$ without
making any assumption regarding the structure of composite fermions in the
topmost partially filled level. The method is exact aside from neglecting the
composite-fermion Landau level mixing, and enables us to study rather large

dimension of the lowest Landau level Hilbert space is $\sim 10^{17}$. We have
investigated, for fully spin polarized composite fermions, several filling

gapless fermions coupled to 3D XY phase fluctuations of the superconducting
order parameter, we propose a continuum field theory to describe the quantum
phase transition between the d-wave superconductor and the spin-density-wave
insulator. Without fermions the theory reduces to the standard Higgs scalar
electrodynamics (HSE), which is known to have the critical point in the
inverted XY universality class. Extending the renormalization group calculation
for the HSE to include the coupling to fermions, we find that the qualitative
effect of fermions is to increase the portion of the space of coupling
constants where the transition is discontinuous. The critical exponents at the
stable fixed point vary continuously with the number of fermion fields $N$, and
we estimate the correlation length exponent (nu = 0.65) and the vortex field
anomalous dimension(eta_Phi=-0.48) at the quantum critical point for the
physical case N=2. The stable critical point in the theory disappears for the
number of Dirac fermions N > N_c, with N_c ~ 3.4 in our approximation. We
discuss the relationship between the superconducting and the chiral (SDW)

regulatory molecules, N(R), the average protein level is high in the steady
state (state 2). The magnitude of the level is the same as long as N{I) greater
than or equal to N(R). When N(I) is very very less than N(R), the average
protein level is low, practically zero (state 1). As N(I) increases, the
protein level continues to remain low. When N(I)becomes close to N(R), protein
levels in the steady state are intermediate between high and low.In the
presence of autocatalysis, a cell mostly exists in either state 1 or state 2
giving rise to a bimodal distribution in the protein levels in an ensemble of
cells. This corresponds to the ""all or none'' phenomenon observed in

explicitly. An exhaustive simulation over the parameter space of the model
shows that there are three major patterns of gene expression, Type A, Type B

state is lowered. In a recent paper, we showed that in the uniform Fermi gas,
this tunable pairing interaction naturally leads to a BCS-BEC crossover of the
Nozi`eres and Schmitt-Rink kind, in which the BCS-type superfluid phase
transition continuously changes into the BEC-type as the threshold energy is
decreased. In this paper, we extend our previous work by including the effect
of a harmonic trap potential, treated within the local density approximation

shape of the atomic density profile at the superfluid phase transition

Fermi atoms to composite Bosons. In the BEC regime, these composite Bosons are
shown to first appear well above Tc. We also discuss the ""phase diagram"" above

broken down into a set of infinite scale invariant structures called ""trees"".
These two types of aggregates have been selected because it has been
established that they belong to different universality classes: those of
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang and Edward-Wilkinson, respectively. Exponents describing
the spatial and temporal scale invariance of the trees can be related to the
classical exponents describing the self-affine nature of the growing interface.
Furthermore, those exponents allows us to distinguish either the compact or

technique for the evaluation of the self-affine properties of some aggregates.

static polynomial space search structures for ordered sets into fully-dynamic

  This leads to an optimal bound of O(sqrt(log n/loglog n)) for searching and
updating a dynamic set of n integer keys in linear space. Here searching an
integer y means finding the maximum key in the set which is smaller than or
equal to y. This problem is equivalent to the standard text book problem of
maintaining an ordered set (see, e.g., Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein:
Introduction to Algorithms, 2nd ed., MIT Press, 2001).
  The best previous deterministic linear space bound was O(log n/loglog n) due
Fredman and Willard from STOC 1990. No better deterministic search bound was
known using polynomial space.

number n, the word length w, and the maximal key U < 2^w: O(min{loglog n+log
n/log w, (loglog n)(loglog U)/(logloglog U)}). These trade-offs are, however,
not likely to be optimal.

eigenvalues to be equally spaced. As shown previously, for a neutral

operators subject to a specific algebra. We show that the algebra of these two

and we show that this hyperspin must be zero. As a result, the degeneracy of
the $n$-th area eigenvalue is reduced to $2^{n}/n^{3/2}$ for large $n$, and
therefore, the logarithmic correction term $-3/2\log A$ should be added to the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We also provide a heuristic approach explaining

critical temperature, the collapse converges to a self-similar form, the first
member in Hunter's family of self-similar solutions. For a temperature close to
the critical value, the collapse first approaches this critical solution. Later
on, in the supercritical case, the collapse converges to another self-similar

the gas bounces and disperses to infinity. We find two scaling laws: one for
the collapsed mass in the supercritical case and the other for the maximum
density reached before dispersal in the subcritical case. The value of the
critical exponent is measured to be $\simeq 0.11$ in the supercritical case,
which agrees well with the predicted value $\simeq 0.10567$. These critical
properties are quite similar to those observed in the collapse of a radiation
fluid in general relativity. We study the response of the system to temperature

1948 when Casimir calculated the force of attraction between parallel uncharged
plates, a phenomenon confirmed experimentally with ever increasing precision.
Casimir himself suggested that a similar attractive self-stress existed for a
conducting spherical shell, but Boyer obtained a repulsive stress. Other
geometries and higher dimensions have been considered over the years. Local
effects, and divergences associated with surfaces and edges have been studied
by several authors. Quite recently, Graham et al. have re-examined such
calculations, using conventional techniques of perturbative quantum field
theory to remove divergences, and have suggested that previous self-stress
results may be suspect. Here we show that the examples considered in their work
are misleading; in particular, it is well-known that in two dimensions a
circular boundary has a divergence in the Casimir energy for massless fields,
while for general dimension $D$ not equal to an even integer the corresponding
Casimir energy arising from massless fields interior and exterior to a
hyperspherical shell is finite. It has also long been recognized that the
Casimir energy for massive fields is divergent for $D\ne1$. These conclusions
are reinforced by a calculation of the relevant leading Feynman diagram in $D$
and three dimensions. There is therefore no doubt of the validity of the
conventional finite Casimir calculations.

not yet been applied to the calculation of nuclear wave functions. However, it
certainly provokes a number of specific questions and suggests the existence of
novel phenomena in nuclear physics which are not part of the the traditional
framework of the meson-nucleon description of nuclei. Many of these phenomena
are related to high nuclear densities and the role of color in nucleonic
interactions. Quantum fluctuations in the spatial separation between nucleons
may lead to local high density configurations of cold nuclear matter in nuclei,
up to four times larger than typical nuclear densities. We argue here that
experiments utilizing the higher energies available upon completion of the
Jefferson Laboratory energy upgrade will be able to probe the quark-gluon
structure of such high density configurations and therefore elucidate the
fundamental nature of nuclear matter. We review three key experimental
programs: quasi-elastic electro-disintegration of light nuclei, deep inelastic
scattering from nuclei at $x>1$, and the measurement of tagged structure
functions. These interrelated programs are all aimed at the exploration of the
quark structure of high density nuclear configurations.
  The study of the QCD dynamics of elementary hard processes is another
important research direction and nuclei provide a unique avenue to explore
these dynamics. We argue that the use of nuclear targets and large values of
momentum transfer at would allow us to determine whether the physics of the
nucleon form factors is dominated by spatially small configurations of three
quarks.

both the entropic version (N) and the unattainability version (U) and the
relation occurring between them. Then, we heuristically interpret (N) as a
continuity boundary condition for thermodynamics at the boundary T=0 of the
thermodynamic domain. On a rigorous mathematical footing, we discuss the third
law both in Carath\'eodory's approach and in Gibbs' one. Carath\'eodory's
approach is fundamental in order to understand the nature of the surface T=0.
In fact, in this approach, under suitable mathematical conditions, T=0 appears
as a leaf of the foliation of the thermodynamic manifold associated with the
non-singular integrable Pfaffian form $\delta Q_{rev}$. Being a leaf, it cannot
intersect any other leaf $S=$ const. of the foliation. We show that (N) is
equivalent to the requirement that T=0 is a leaf. In Gibbs' approach, the
peculiar nature of T=0 appears to be less evident because the existence of the
entropy is a postulate; nevertheless, it is still possible to conclude that the
lowest value of the entropy has to belong to the boundary of the convex set
where the function is defined.

Our method is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional techniques,
when applied to large-scale data. Rather than alloting each gene to a single
cluster, we assign both genes and conditions to context-dependent and
potentially overlapping transcription modules. We provide a rigorous definition
of a transcription module as the object to be retrieved from the expression
data. An efficient algorithm, that searches for the modules encoded in the data
by iteratively refining sets of genes and conditions until they match this
definition, is established. Each iteration involves a linear map, induced by
the normalized expression matrix, followed by the application of a threshold
function. We argue that our method is in fact a generalization of Singular
Value Decomposition, which corresponds to the special case where no threshold
is applied. We show analytically that for noisy expression data our approach
leads to better classification due to the implementation of the threshold. This
result is confirmed by numerical analyses based on in-silico expression data.
We discuss briefly results obtained by applying our algorithm to expression
data from the yeast S. cerevisiae.

regime. Electron emission is found to be unexpectedly asymmetric and exhibits a
resonance when the laser pulse duration is $\sim$1 ps. These results are
rationalized by extending the hydrodynamic model to also take into account the
force that the light field exerts on the polarization charge that is induced on
surface of the cluster. We show that the magnitude of this electrostrictive
force is comparable to those of Coulombic and the hydrodynamic forces, and it
exhibits resonance behavior. Contrary to earlier understanding, we find that
low-energy electrons are connected to the resonance in energy absorption by the
cluster. The high-energy electrons seem to be produced by a mechanism that is
not so strongly influenced by the resonance.

complex structure arising from coupling to C-C stretch motion, to torsional
motion, and to Rydberg excitations. The mean energy of the observed peak is
reproduced to about 0.2 eV accuracy by the TDDFT in the local density
approximation (LDA). The reflection approximation is used to calculate the peak
broadening. Roughly half of the broadening can be attributed to the fluctuation
in the C-C coordinate. The asymmetry in the line shape is also qualitatively
reproduced by the C-C coordinate fluctuation. We find, in agreement with other
theoretical studies, that the torsional motion is responsible for the
progression of weak transition strength extending from the peak down to about 6
eV. The LDA reproduces the strength in this region to about factor of 3. We
conclude that the TDDFT is rather promising for calculating the electron
nucleus coupling at short times.
