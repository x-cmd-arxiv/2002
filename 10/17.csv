strong H-alpha emission. Two spectroscopic epochs appeared to show that the
H-alpha was variable, decreasing from 121 Angstroms to 25 Angstroms EW, which I
interpreted as a flare during the first observation. Gizis (2002) independently
discovered this object, and his intermediate spectroscopic epoch shows H-alpha
with 97 Angstroms EW. A new fourth epoch of spectroscopy again shows a very
large H-alpha EW (124 Angstroms), confirming this object to be a persistent,
strong H-alpha emitter. Whether the H-alpha is steady (like 2MASS 1237+6526) or
from continuous strong flaring (like PC0025+0447) remains unclear. Imaging
confirms that 2MASS 1315-2649 has a high proper motion (0.71""/year),
corresponding to a transverse velocity of ~76 km/s at its distance of ~23 pc.
Thus 2MASS 1315-2649 is consistent with being >~2 Gyr old and therefore
relatively massive. If that is so, the correlation of H-alph activity with mass
found by Gizis et al. (2000) would seem to support the continuous strong
flaring scenario, though it does not rule out a brown dwarf binary accretion
scenario.

derived from the BLR and NLR are A_V >= 3.7 and A_V=1.7, respectively. The
X-ray observations give an A_V value of less than 0.58, in contrast to the

relative motion of the source, the lens, and the observer is linear. In
reality, the relative motion is likely to be more complicated due to
accelerations of the observer, the lens and the source. The simplest
approximation beyond the linear-motion assumption is to add a constant
acceleration. Microlensing light curves due to accelerations can be symmetric
or asymmetric depending on the angle between the acceleration and the velocity.
We show that it is possible that some of the previously reported shorter
marginal parallax events can be reproduced with constant-acceleration models,
while the longer, multi-year parallax events are ill-fitted by such models. We
find that there is a generic degeneracy inherent in constant-acceleration
microlensing models. We also find that there is an equivalent degeneracy in
parallax models, which manifests itself in short-duration events. The
importance of this new parallax degeneracy is illustrated with an example,
using one of these marginal parallax events. Our new analysis suggests that
another of these previously suspected parallax candidate events may be
exhibiting some weak binary-source signatures. If this turns out to be true,
spectroscopic observations of the source could determine some parameters in the
model and may also constrain or even determine the lens mass. We also point out
that symmetric light curves with constant accelerations can mimic blended light
curves, producing misleading Einstein-radius crossing time-scales when fitted
by the standard `blended' microlensing model; this may have some effect on the
estimation of optical depth.

source 4C +12.50 (PKS 1345+125) at a wavelength of 2 cm. This compact radio
source is associated with a hidden quasar whose host galaxy shows signs of a
recent merger. It has been classified as a compact symmetric source (CSO) due
to its small overall size (~220 pc) and twin-jet morphology, although it also
has faint extended emission that may be a relic of previous activity. We report
the detection of exceedingly high linear fractional polarization in isolated
features of the southern jet (up to 60%), which is highly unusual for a CSO.
Given the large amount of gas present in the host galaxy, we would expect
significant Faraday depolarization across the whole source, unless the
depolarizing gas is fairly clumpy. The southern jet also contains two features
that are moving outward from the core at apparent speeds of v/c = 1.0 +/- 0.3
and 1.2 +/- 0.3. These represent the first positive detections of superluminal
motion in a CSO, and taken together with the jet to counter-jet flux ratio,
suggest an intrinsic flow speed of v/c = 0.84 +/- 0.12. The apparent ridgeline
of the jet and counter-jet are consistent with a conical helix of wavelength
280 pc that is the result of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities driven by a slow
precession of the jet nozzle. A fit to the data implies that the nozzle is
precessing around a cone with half-angle 23 degrees, whose axis lies at an
angle of 82 degrees to the line of sight. We suggest that the ""S""-shaped jet
morphologies commonly seen in recent AGN outflows such as 4C +12.50 may simply
reflect the fact that their black hole spin axes are still precessing, and have
not had sufficient time to align with their accretion disks.

their lifetime (either intergalactic gas, or galaxies) because they will
typically lose the competition with the much larger galaxy. We can utilise
observations of stars of a range of ages to measure star formation and
enrichment histories back to the earliest epochs. The most ancient objects we
have ever observed in the Universe are stars found in and around our Galaxy.
Their proximity allows us to extract from their properties detailed information

will be closer to the near and far side of the bar, respectively. We find that
the far-side RCGs (4,979 stars) have a proper motion of \Delta <\mu> ~ 1.5 +-
0.11 mas yr^{-1} toward the negative l relative to the near-side RCGs (3,610
stars). This result can be explained by stars in the bar rotating around the
Galactic center in the same direction as the Sun with v_b ~ 100 km s^{-1}. In
the Disc Star (DS) and Red Giant (RG) samples, we do not find significant
difference between bright and faint sub-samples. For those samples \Delta <\mu>
\~ 0.3 +- 0.14 mas yr^{-1} and ~ 0.03 +- 0.14 mas yr^{-1}, respectively. It is
likely that the average proper motion of RG stars is the same as that of the
Galactic center. The proper motion of DSs with respect to RGs is ~ 3.3 mas
yr^{-1} toward positive l. This value is consistent with the expectations for a
flat rotation curve and Solar motion with respect to local standard of rest.
RGs have proper motion approzimately equal to the average of bright and faint
RCGs, which implies that they are on average near the center of the bar. This
pilot project demonstrates that OGLE-II data may be used to study streaming
motions of stars in the Galactic bar. We intend to extend this work to all 49

properties are explained in the context of the radiation driven wind theory, of
which we consider four different models. They are due to the evolutionary
changes in radius, gravity and surface composition and to the change from
optically thin (in continuum) line driven winds to optically thick radiation

is classified as a star-forming galaxy on the basis of the ionization level of
its emission lines. However, a weak broad H\alpha wing and a high
  X-ray luminosity give away the presence of an active nucleus. The Chandra
image reveals a nuclear point source (L_(2-10 keV) 6x10^{41} erg s-1),
contributing over 80% of the galaxy X-ray counts in the 0.3-8 keV band.
  This is surrounded by some fainter nebulosity extending up to 6 kpc.
  The nucleus does not show evidence for short-term variability. However, we
detect long term variations between the ROSAT, ASCA and Chandra epoch.
  Indeed,the source has decreased its flux by over a factor of 25 in a period
of about 10 years. The nuclear X-ray spectrum is well represented by a
power-law with a photon index of 1.91^{+0.17}_{-0.15} while the extended
emission by a Raymond-Smith component with a temperature of 0.6 keV.
  We find no evidence for the presence of an Fe line. The nucleus is absorbed
by an intrinsic column density of N_H ~ 8x10^{20} cm-2. Thus the Chandra
observations suggest that at least the X-ray emission is dominated by a type-1
  AGN. Then the observed optical spectrum can be explained due to the masking
of the nucleus by the powerful star-forming component. These together with
previous X-ray observations of galaxies with no clear signs of AGN activity in
the optical, (eg NGC6240) cast doubt on the optical classification scheme and
have implications for the nature of the 'normal' galaxies detected in deep

present new results from optical and ultraviolet spectra of the central ~40pc
as measured by HST. In contrast with previous results for the extended disk,
the emission-line spectrum of the central region is best reproduced by a
multi-component photoionization scenario, rather than shock heating. The
nebular properties as well as energetic considerations suggest a transition on
scales of several tens of parsecs, from predominantly photoionization by a
central accretion source, to shock ionization within the disk. If this source
is at all representative, it suggests that many LINERs may be composite in
terms of the energetic processes that give rise to the emission spectrum. We
also report measurements of resonance-line absorption for the nucleus. The
absorption spectrum, like the emission lines, is characterized by low
ionization. The absorption line measurements coupled with independent
constraints suggests a total hydrogen column density of 10^19 - 10^20 cm^-2,
outflowing from the galaxy center with a velocity of ~126 km/s. The kinematic
signature of an outflow, along with evidence that the absorber covers the
power-law continuum source but not the emission-line clouds, suggests that the
absorbing matter is related to accretion phenomena in the nucleus. The presence
of such an outflow resembles similar behaviour in luminous AGN, although the
low ionization that characterizes LINERs is probably indicative of a different
mode of accretion in these sources.

does not depend on the blue luminosity. The average, 12+log(O/H)=8.34+-0.20, is

probably pre-existing low-mass companions. The estimated Ha luminosity of the
TDG candidates is higher than the one of typical individual HII regions in

find several instances of velocity gradients with amplitudes apparently larger
than 100 km/s in the ionized gas in the tidal knots and discuss various
possible origins for the large velocity amplitudes. While we can exclude tidal
streaming motions and outflows, we cannot rule out projection effects with the

Pr0.9Sr0.1CoO2.99 in an applied field of 100 Oe show that, as temperature
decreases, the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetisation
curves branch clearly at 50 K, and a cusp appears in the ZFC branch at Tcusp 20
K. Magnetisation measurements in various fields between 100 and 10,000 Oe show
that both the ZFC-FC branching temperature and, Tcusp, decrease with increasing
field. The magnetization-field isotherms at 5 and 10 K show hysteresis loops
typical of ferromagnets. No appreciable MR is seen in this compound at 50 K,
i.e. at a temperature close to ZFC-FC branching temperature. At 20 K, negative
MR of above 16% is observed without any hysteresis effect. We believe that the
appearance of a ferromagnetic component at 5 K and 10 K (i.e. at temperatures
below Tcusp) within the spin glass state of Co spins is responsible for both
large MR and the prominent hysteresis/memory effect in MR.

Superconductivity is found to coexist with low frequency spin fluctuations over

temperature of spin fluctuations detected by muSR decreases with increasing
doping and vanishes above a critical doping pc=0.19 where the normal state
pseudogap vanishes. Furthermore, it is at pc that our penetration depth studies

p>pc the absolute value of the superfluid density is large and nearly
independent of carrier concentration whereas for p<pc it drops rapidly,
signalling a crossover to weak superconductivity. These results are discussed

superexchange-coupled antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator to an almost-HS
AFM/ferromagnetic (FM) competing system where the FM coupling is mediated via
the p-d exchange by an increasing amount of delocalized pd\sigma holes having
mainly the planar O 2p character. It is tentatively suggested that the
delocalized holes more than 0.3 per CoO_{2} basal square are likely necessary
for the insulator-metal and/or AFM-FM transitions in the corrugation-weakened
LCOs. A phase control may be realized in LCOs by varying the plane corrugation
(thus modifying the hole concentration) through an ionic-size change of the
neighboring layers on both sides of the cobalt-oxygen layer. In addition, a few
experiments are suggested for a check of the present model and picture.

  scattering from measurements of pi(-)p->pi(-)pi(+)n on polarized target at
  17.2 GeV/c","29 pages (RevTex), 13 figures",,,,"hep-ph hep-ex",,"  We present a new model independent amplitude analysis of reaction
pi(-)p->pi(-) pi(+)n measured at CERN at 17.2 GeV/c on polarized target using a
Monte Carlo method for dipion mass 580-1080 MeV. The two solutions for measured
moduli |Sbar|^2 and |S|^2 of the two S-wave transversity amplitudes Sbar and S
show res onant behaviour below 800 MeV corresponding to a scalar resonance
sigma(770). Simultaneous fits to |Sbar|^2 and |S|^2 include f_0(980). The CERN
data on polar ized target supplemented by the assumption of analyticity of
production amplitud es in dipion mass allow to determine the helicity
amplitudes S_0 (a_1 exchange) and S_1 (pi exchange) from fitted transversity
amplitudes. The sign ambiguity in sigma(770) contribution leads to 2 solutions.
In the ""down"" solution sigma(770) is suppressed in the helicity flip amplitude
S_1 and thus also in pi(-)pi(+)-> pi(-)pi(+) scattering. Most contribution of
sigma(770) to pion production is in the nonflip amplitude S_0, or in
pi(-)a_1(+)->pi(-)pi(+) scattering. In the ""up"" solution the situation is
reversed. The ""up"" solution is excluded by unitarity in pipi scattering. The
""down"" solution, and thus the evidence for sigma(770), is in agreement with
unitarity in both pi(-)pi(+)->pi(-)pi(+) and pi(-)a_1(+)-> pi(-)pi(+)
scattering. There are 4 ""down"" solutions (1, 1bar), (2, 1bar), (1, 2bar) and
(2, 2bar). The sigma(770) resonance manifests itself as a broad resonant
structure at ~ 720 MeV in the flip amplitude |S_1|^2 in solutions (1, 1bar) and
(2, 1bar). The contribution of sigma(770) to |S_1|^2 is small in solutions (1,
2bar) and (2, 2bar). The metamorphosis of a narrow sigma(770) in the nonflip
amplitude S_0 into a broad resonant structure in the flip amplitude S_1 is a
new phenomenon related to breaking of scale and chiral symmetry in QCD.

and momentum operators generate the Lie superalgebra sl(1|3), are further
investigated. Within each state space W(p), p=1,2,..., the energy E_q,
q=0,1,2,3, takes no more than 4 different values. If the oscillator is in a
stationary state \psi_q \in W(p) then measurements of the non-commuting
Cartesian coordinates of the particle are such that their allowed values are
consistent with it being found at a finite number of sites, called ``nests''.
These lie on a sphere centered on the origin of fixed, finite radius \varrho_q.
The nests themselves are at the vertices of a rectangular parallelepiped. In
the typical cases (p>2) the number of nests is 8 for q=0 and 3, and varies from
8 to 24, depending on the state, for q=1 and 2. The number of nests is less in
the atypical cases (p=1,2), but it is never less than two. In certain states in
W(2) (resp. in W(1)) the oscillator is ``polarized'' so that all the nests lie
on a plane (resp. on a line). The particle cannot be localized in any one of
the available nests alone since the coordinates do not commute. The
probabilities of measuring particular values of the coordinates are discussed.
The mean trajectories and the standard deviations of the coordinates and
momenta are computed, and conclusions are drawn about uncertainty relations.
The rotational invariance of the system is also discussed.

in which the perturbations evolve. This back-reaction arises as a second order
effect in the cosmological perturbation expansion. The effect is cumulative in
the sense that all fluctuation modes contribute to the change in the background
geometry, and as a consequence the back-reaction effect can be large even if
the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is small. We review two approaches
used to quantify back-reaction. In the first approach, the effect of the
fluctuations on the background is expressed in terms of an effective
energy-momentum tensor. We show that in the context of an inflationary
background cosmology, the long wavelength contributions to the effective
energy-momentum tensor take the form of a negative cosmological constant, whose
absolute value increases as a function of time since the phase space of
infrared modes is increasing. This then leads to the speculation that
gravitational back-reaction may lead to a dynamical cancellation mechanism for
a bare cosmological constant, and yield a scaling fixed point in the asymptotic
future in which the remnant cosmological constant satisfies $\Omega_{\Lambda}
\sim 1$. We then discuss how infrared modes effect local observables (as
opposed to mathematical background quantities) and find that the leading
infrared back-reaction contributions cancel in single field inflationary
models. However, we expect non-trivial back-reaction of infrared modes in
models with more than one matter field.

electrodynamics (QED), considering a cold two-level atom in a single-mode
high-finesse standing-wave cavity as a nonlinear Hamiltonian system with three
coupled degrees of freedom: translational, internal atomic, and the field. The
system proves to have different types of motion including L\'{e}vy flights and
chaotic walkings of an atom in a cavity. It is shown that the translational
motion, related to the atom recoils, is governed by an equation of a parametric
nonlinear pendulum with a frequency modulated by the Rabi oscillations. This
type of dynamics is chaotic with some width of the stochastic layer that is
estimated analytically. The width is fairly small for realistic values of the
control parameters, the normalized detuning $\delta$ and atomic recoil
frequency $\alpha$. It is demonstrated how the atom-photon dynamics with a
given value of $\alpha$ depends on the values of $\delta$ and initial
conditions. Two types of L\'{e}vy flights, one corresponding to the ballistic
motion of the atom and another one corresponding to small oscillations in a
potential well, are found. These flights influence statistical properties of
the atom-photon interaction such as distribution of Poincar\'{e} recurrences
and moments of the atom position $x$. The simulation shows different regimes of
motion, from slightly abnormal diffusion with $<x^2>\sim\tau^{1.13}$ at $\delta
=1.2$ to a superdiffusion with $<x^2> \sim \tau^{2.2}$ at $\delta=1.92$ that
corresponds to a superballistic motion of the atom with an acceleration. The
obtained results can be used to find new ways to manipulate atoms, to cool and
trap them by adjusting the detuning $\delta$.

application of non-uniform filters to the Navier-Stokes equations. As a
consequence, the filtered velocity field is no longer solenoidal. The order of
magnitude of the commutator-errors is compared with the divergence of the
turbulent stresses. This shows that one can not reduce the size of the
commutator-errors independently of the turbulent stress terms by some judicious
construction of the filter operator. Similarity modeling for the
commutator-errors is presented, including an extension of Bardina's approach
and the application of Leray regularization. The performance of the
commutator-error parameterization is illustrated with the one-dimensional
Burgers equation. For large filter-width variations the Leray approach is shown

for the propagation of light in this system are calculated using Feynman

these results to determine the amplitude and timing jitter of a signal pulse
and to estimate the system capacity in analog communication.

extend the effective Hamiltonian that describes partially a physical system so
that the new Hamiltonian comprises, in addition to the information in the old

simple expression of the enlarged Hamiltonian, which does not involve matrix
inversion, is obtained. It is also shown that the Lee-Suzuki transformation

placing the dipole at the center of a spherical cavity of radius $R$ inside the
dielectric and then letting $R\to 0$. The result disagrees with the elementary
answer found in textbooks. The mathematical and physical reasons for the
disagreement are discussed. The discrepancy is confirmed by the same limiting
procedure applied to a uniformly polarized sphere embedded in the dielectric.
We next solve the same problem for a polarized spheroid immersed in an infinite
dielectric and find that the asymptotic potential shows an unexpected shape
dependence, even after taking the limit of an arbitrarily small spheroid. By
considering both oblate and prolate spheroids and taking appropriate limits, we
recover either the elementary textbook answer or the previous result found for
the polarized sphere.

  (http://redshift.vif.com/JournalFiles/V09NO4PDF/V09N4sel.pdf)",,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Continuous periodogram power spectral analyses of fractal fluctuations of
frequency distributions of bases A, C, G, T in Drosophila DNA show that the
power spectra follow the universal inverse power-law form of the statistical
normal distribution. Inverse power-law form for power spectra of space-time
fluctuations is generic to dynamical systems in nature and is identified as
self-organized criticality. The author has developed a general systems theory,
which provides universal quantification for observed self-organized criticality
in terms of the statistical normal distribution. The long-range correlations
intrinsic to self-organized criticality in macro-scale dynamical systems are a
signature of quantumlike chaos. The fractal fluctuations self-organize to form
an overall logarithmic spiral trajectory with the quasiperiodic Penrose tiling
pattern for the internal structure. Power spectral analysis resolves such a
spiral trajectory as an eddy continuum with embedded dominant wavebands. The
dominant peak periodicities are functions of the golden mean. The observed
fractal frequency distributions of the Drosophila DNA base sequences exhibit
quasicrystalline structure with long-range spatial correlations or
self-organized criticality. Modification of the DNA base sequence structure at
any location may have significant noticeable effects on the function of the DNA
molecule as a whole. The presence of non-coding introns may not be redundant,
but serve to organize the effective functioning of the coding exons in the DNA
molecule as a complete unit.

the dynamics of a total system, which is composed of an entangled two-mode

It is shown that many-body entanglement of the system and the environment plays
a crucial role in the process of disentangling the system.
