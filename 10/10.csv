applicable to TeV blazars, and investigate through simulations how each of the
model parameters would affect to the observed light curve or spectrum. In
particular, we show that the internal shock scenario naturally leads to all the
observed variability properties including the structure function, but for it to
be applicable, the fractional fluctuation of the initial bulk Lorentz factors
must be small, with sigma_gamma / gamma_average < 0.01. This implies very low
dynamical efficiency of the internal shock scenario. We also suggest that
several observational quantities -- such as the characteristic time scale, the
relative amplitude of flares as compared to the steady (``offset'') component,
and the slope of the structure function -- can be used to probe the inner jet.
The results are applied to the TeV blazar Mrk421, and this, within the context
of the model, leads to the determination of several physical parameters: the
ejection of a shell with average thickness of ~1E13 cm occurs on average every

hydrogen atmospheres and an underlying reservoir of nuclei capable of proton
capture. This burning occurs in the exponentially suppressed diffusive tail of
H that extends to the hotter depths of the envelope where protons are rapidly
captured. This process, which we call diffusive nuclear burning (DNB), can
change the H abundance at the NS photosphere on timescales as short as
$10^{2-4}$ years. In the absence of diffusion, the hydrogen at the photosphere
(where $T\approx 10^6 {\rm K}$ and $\rho\sim 0.1 {\rm g cm^{-2}}$) would last
for far longer than a Hubble time. Our work impacts the understanding of the
evolution of surface abundances of isolated NSs, which is important to their
thermal spectrum and their effective temperature-core temperature relation. In
this paper, we calculate the rate of H burning when the overall consumption
rate is controlled by the nuclear timescales, rather than diffusion timescales.
The immediate application is for H burning on millisecond radio pulsars and in
quiescence for the accreting NS Cen X-4. We will apply this work to young radio

photospheric chemical composition. Here, we compare the predicted variations in
the solar photospheric composition with precise measurements of abundances in
meteorites and the solar wind composition. Although elemental composition
ratios can vary by roughly a percent (e. g. for Ca/Mg and Ca/Fe) over the Sun's
lifetime, their measurements are rife with uncertainties related to
uncertainties in the interpretation of meteoritic measurements, photospheric
determinations, and the complex fractionation processes occurring between the
upper photosphere and lower chromosphere and the corona. On the other hand,
isotopic ratios can be measured much more accurately and are not expected to be
affected as much by extrasolar processes, although more work is required to
quantify their effect. As the isotopic ratios evolve in the Sun proportionally
to the mass ratios of the isotopes, light elements yield the highest variations
in isotopic ratios. They are predicted to reach as high as 0.6% for
$^{18}$O/$^{16}$O and are only slightly lower in the cases of

an empirical approach. The oxygen abundances and nitrogen to oxygen abundances
ratios are derived in HII regions of a number of spiral galaxies through the
recently suggested P-method using more than six hundred published spectra. The
N/O - O/H diagram for HII regions in irregular and spiral galaxies is
constructed. It is found that the N/O values in HII regions of spiral galaxies
of early morphological types are higher than those in HII regions with the same
metallicity in spiral galaxies of late morphological types. This suggests a
long-time-delayed contribution to the nitrogen production. The N/O ratio of a
galaxy can then be used as an indicator of the time that has elapsed since the
bulk of star formation occurred, or in other words of the nominal ""age"" of the
galaxy as suggested by Edmunds and Pagel more than twenty years ago. The
scatter in N/O values at a given O/H can be naturally explained by differences
in star formation histories in galaxies. While low-metallicity dwarf galaxies
with low N/O do not contain an appreciable amount of old stars, low-metallicity
dwarf galaxies with an appreciable fraction of old stars have high N/O.
Consideration of planetary nebulae in the Small Magellanic Cloud and in the
Milky Way Galaxy suggests that the contribution of low-mass stars to the
nitrogen production is significant, confirming the conclusion that there is a
long-time-delayed contribution to the nitrogen production.

  of Durham, supervised by John Lucey",,,,"astro-ph",,"  This study assesses the utility of applying the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation
using photometric data from the 2MASS project. This is achieved by performing a
preliminary analysis using 2MASS extended source data with the SCI sample of
Giovanelli et al. (1997). Distances and peculiar velocities are measured for 11
clusters out to approx. 75/h Mpc. Statistics are found to be limited by the 47%
coverage of the current 2MASS second incremental release. However, the 2MASS J,
H and K-band photometry produce results in good agreement with those derived
from the SCI I-band data. These results are also generally in reasonable
agreement with Giovanelli et al.s' (1997, 1998) own analysis. Comparison of the
results obtained with two different 2MASS magnitudes suggests they are not
overly sensitive to the type of magnitude used. It is concluded that the 2MASS
TF is a useful tool for distance and peculiar velocity work, especially with
the improved coverage that will be provided by the full 2MASS release.
  A general discussion of the Tully-Fisher relation and previous work,
particularly in the near-infra-red, is also presented.

that the HI absorption is highly localised against the south-western
radio-emission with column densities 1.9x10^21/cm2. The absorption is broad and
red-shifted by 130 km/s relative to the systemic velocity. The HST images in
430nm, 702nm, [OIII] 500.7nm, [FeII] 1.64um and K-band polarization are
presented. Evidence is seen for coincidence of the [FeII] emission with the
knot at the end of the radio jet, suggesting the presence of shocks. We compare
the optical and radio images in order to investigate the relationship between
the dust and neutral gas. An unresolved (0.07-arcsec) nucleus is detected in H
and K and its properties are consistent with a quasar reddened by A(V)>4. We
propose that the absorption arises in a region of neutral gas and dust whose
structure is complex but is broadly consistent with an inclined disc
encircling, but not covering, the active galactic nucleus. A comparison of the
neutral gas observations and previous emission-line observations suggests that
both the neutral and ionised gas are undergoing galactic rotation towards the
observer in the north-east and away from the observer in the south-west. We
propose that the outflow giving rise to the radio emission has a component
towards the observer in the north-east and away from the observer in the
south-west.

distribution with the galactocentric radius in the inner Galaxy. This has been
a long-standing puzzle (Oort 1962) because the gas scaleheight should increase
with radius when treated as responding to the gravitational potential of the
exponential stellar disk. We argue that the gravitational force of the
molecular and atomic hydrogen gas should also be brought into the picture to
explain this. We treat the stars, the HI and H_2 gas as three gravitationally
coupled components in the Galactic disk, and find the response of each
component to the joint potential and thus obtain their vertical distribution in
a self-consistent fashion. The effect of the joint potential is different for
the three components because of their different velocity dispersions. We show
that this approach cohesively and naturally explains the observed scaleheight
distribution of all the three components, namely, the HI and H_2 gas and the
stars, in the region studied (2-12 kpc). This includes the constant scaleheight
for the HI seen in the inner Galaxy. The effect of H_2 dominates in the

reference to the non linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory, the method is
successfully tested against the geometry of the macro-ions, the possible
confinement in a Wigner-Seitz cell, and the presence of added salt. Moreover,
our results are corroborated by various experimental measures reported in the

modulation-induced modification of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations at higher

modification of the usual one-parameter scaling, such as to accommodate the
anisotropy of the bare conductivity tensor. We also show how the two-parameter

of electron-electron interaction effects. On the other hand, excited state
ordering opposite to that in trans-polyacetylene is usually obtained by

originate from extra components of higher dimensional gauge fields. Theories of
this type considered before have had problems accommodating the standard model
fermion content and Yukawa couplings different from the gauge coupling.
Considering orbifolds based on abelian discrete groups we are lead to a 6
dimensional G_2 gauge theory compactified on T^2/Z_4. This theory can naturally
produce the SM Higgs fields with the right quantum numbers while predicting the
value of the weak mixing angle sin^2 theta_W = 0.25 at the tree-level, close to
the experimentally observed one. The quartic scalar coupling for the Higgs is
generated by the higher dimensional gauge interaction and predicts the
existence of a light Higgs. We point out that one can write a quadratically
divergent counter term for Higgs mass localized to the orbifold fixed point.
However, we calculate these operators and show that higher dimensional gauge
interactions do not generate them at least at one loop. Fermions are introduced
at orbifold fixed points, making it easy to accommodate the standard model
fermion content. Yukawa interactions are generated by Wilson lines. They may be
generated by the exchange of massive bulk fermions, and the fermion mass
hierarchy can be obtained. Around a TeV, the first KK modes would appear as
well as additional fermion modes localized at the fixed point needed to cancel
the quadratic divergences from the Yukawa interactions. The cutoff scale of the
theory could be a few times 10 TeV.

the experimental data. A new method to explore the Chiral Symmetry
Spontaneously Breaking (CSSB) is proposed. It is found that the unitarity of
the effective meson theory resulted from resummation derivations demands an
upper-limit to the momentum of vector meson. This upper-limit, being critical
point, is just the energy scale of CSSB, and is found to be flavor-dependent.

domains (in [CM6]) we need in addition to the results of [CM3]-[CM5] a key
estimate for embedded stable annuli which is the main result of this paper.
This estimate asserts that such an annulus is a graph away from its boundary if
it has only one interior boundary component and if this component lies in a
small (extrinsic) ball.

on N (cf. symplectic, complex or hypercomplex). We define a left invariant
Riemannian metric on N compatible with S to be ""minimal"", if it minimizes the
norm of the invariant part of the Ricci tensor among all compatible metrics
with the same scalar curvature. We prove that minimal metrics (if any) are
unique up to isometry and scaling, they develop soliton solutions for the
invariant Ricci flow and are characterized as the critical points of a natural
variational problem. The uniqueness allows us to distinguish geometric
structures with Riemannian data, giving rise to a great deal of invariants.
  Our approach proposes to vary Lie brackets and our main tool is the moment
map for the action of a reductive Lie group on the algebraic variety of all Lie
algebras, which we show to coincide with the Ricci operator. We therefore can
use strong results from geometric invariant theory to study compatible metrics
and the moduli space of isomorphism classes of geometric structures.

principle, if the qubit to be copied is destroyed in the original system.
Quantum teleportation3,4 is supposed to allow for such a result. Here, this
belief is shown to be invalidated by a fundamental uncertainty about the number
of particles involved in any process, as predicted by Quantum Field Theory. As
a result, teleportation cannot provide an infallible copying procedure for the
single qubits, not even in the limit of perfect experimental sensitivities. The
no-cloning theorem1,2 can then be generalized to the case of destroying the
original. Teleportation remains an interesting statistical procedure, having an
unavoidable theoretical error at the percent level or few orders of magnitude
smaller, depending on the physical process that is used. Although it cannot be

fundamental research topic over the last five years. This study is of
particular significance given the close connection between quantum cloning and
quantum cryptography: using an optimal cloner generally makes it possible to
obtain a tight bound on the best individual eavesdropping strategy in a quantum
cryptosystem. In this Chapter, the issue of cloning a continuous-variable
quantum system will be analyzed, and a Gaussian cloning transformation will be
introduced. This cloner, which copies equally well any two canonically
conjugate continuous variables, duplicates all coherent states with a same
fidelity (F=2/3). The optical implementation of this cloner and its extension
to N-to-M cloners will also be discussed. Finally, the use of this cloner for
the security assessment of a quantum key distribution scheme relying on

  version","Quantum Information and Computation, vol. 3, pp. 581-602 (2003)",,,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum states cannot be cloned. I show how to extend this property to
classical messages encoded using quantum states, a task I call ""uncloneable
encryption."" An uncloneable encryption scheme has the property that an
eavesdropper Eve not only cannot read the encrypted message, but she cannot
copy it down for later decoding. She could steal it, but then the receiver Bob
would not receive the message, and would thus be alerted that something was
amiss. I prove that any authentication scheme for quantum states acts as a
secure uncloneable encryption scheme. Uncloneable encryption is also closely
related to quantum key distribution (QKD), demonstrating a close connection
between cryptographic tasks for quantum states and for classical messages.
Thus, studying uncloneable encryption and quantum authentication allows for
some modest improvements in QKD protocols. While the main results apply to a
one-time key with unconditional security, I also show uncloneable encryption
remains secure with a pseudorandom key. In this case, to defeat the scheme, Eve
must break the computational assumption behind the pseudorandom sequence before
Bob receives the message, or her opportunity is lost. This means uncloneable
encryption can be used in a non-interactive setting, where QKD is not
available, allowing Alice and Bob to convert a temporary computational
assumption into a permanently secure message.

considerable flexibility, presenting interesting opportunities for development
of other, possibly novel quantum algorithms.

a magnetic dipole pointing in a certain fixed direction: along a purely time
dependent magnetic field in the SAB case and perpendicular to a planar static
electric field in the AC case. We extend these effects to arbitrary direction
of the magnetic dipole. The precise conditions for having nondispersive
precession and interference effects in these generalized set ups are delineated
both classically and quantally. Under these conditions the dipole is affected
by a nonvanishing torque that causes pure precession around the directions
defined by the ideal set ups. It is shown that the precession angles are in the
quantal case linearly related to the ideal phase differences, and that the
nonideal phase differences are nonlinearly related to the ideal phase
differences. It is argued that the latter nonlinearity is due the appearance of
a geometric phase associated with the nontrivial spin path. It is further
demonstrated that the spatial force vanishes in all cases except in the
classical treatment of the nonideal AC set up, where the occurring force has to
be compensated by the experimental arrangement. Finally, for a closed
space-time loop the local precession effects can be inferred from the
interference pattern characterized by the nonideal phase differences and the
visibilities. It is argued that this makes it natural to regard SAB and AC as
essentially local and nontopological effects.

unique noise processes that make none of them fully reliable at this time.
There are several error correction/avoidance techniques which are valuable for
reducing or eliminating errors, but not one, alone, will serve as a panacea.
One must therefore take advantage of the strength of each of these techniques
so that we may extend the coherence times of the quantum systems and create
more reliable computing devices. To this end we give a general strategy for
using dynamical decoupling operations on encoded subspaces. These encodings may
be of any form; of particular importance are decoherence-free subspaces and
quantum error correction codes. We then give means for empirically determining
an appropriate set of dynamical decoupling operations for a given experiment.
Using these techniques, we then propose a comprehensive encoding solution to
many of the problems of quantum computing proposals which use exchange-type
interactions. This uses a decoherence-free subspace and an efficient set of
dynamical decoupling operations. It also addresses the problems of
controllability in solid state quantum dot devices.
