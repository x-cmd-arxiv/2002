scenario could produce regions with low N content respect to $\alpha$-elements
consistent with observed values measured in Damped Ly-$\alpha$ (DLAs). We have
studied the formation of DLAs in a hierarchical clustering scenario under the
hypothesis that the building blocks of current field galaxies could be part of
the structures mapped by DLAs. In our models the effects of the non-linear
evolution of the structure (which produces bursty star formation histories, gas
infall, etc.) and the contributions of SNIa and SNII are found to be
responsible of producing these N regions with respect to the $\alpha$-elements.
Although SNIa are not main production sites for Si or O, because of the
particular timing Consistently, we found the simulated low nitrogen DLAs to
have sub-solar [Fe/H]. We show that low nitrogen DLAs have experienced
important star formation activity in the past with higher efficiency than
normal DLAs. Our chemical model suggests that SNIa play a relevant role in the
determination of the abundance pattern of DLA and, that the observed low
nitrogen DLA frequency could be explained taking into account the time-delay of
$\approx $ 0.5 Gyr introduced by these supernova to release metals.

the environment using a volume-limited sample of nearby galaxy spectra
extracted from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. The environment is characterized
by the local number density of galaxies, corrected for sample incompleteness
and border effects. Using the equivalent widths of [O II]$\lambda$3727 and
H$\delta$ we discriminate the star-forming galaxies in two classes, starbursts
and ordinary star-forming galaxies, and evaluate their properties as a function
of the local density. We show that the fraction of ordinary star-forming
galaxies decreases regularly with increasing density, indicating that star
formation is sensitive to the environment for all range of densities present in
the sample. The fraction of starbursts is approximately independent of the
density and, consequently, the fraction of starbursts relative to star-forming
galaxies increases with local density. This suggests that a mechanism that acts
everywhere, like tidal interactions, is the responsible for triggering
starbursts. We also show that while the mean EW(H$\alpha$) of ordinary
star-forming galaxies is progressively reduced as density increases, for
starbursts it suffers a strong decrease at densities corresponding to scales of
$\rho^{-1/3} \sim 2.5 ~h^{-1}$ Mpc. A visual inspection of starburst images in
the {\it Digital Sky Survey} reveals that this corresponds to a change in the
morphology of starburst galaxies, from mainly apparently normal spirals and
galaxies with apparently compact morphologies at low densities, to tidally
distorted spirals at high densities.

directly related to the existence of the orbit family whose major axis is
perpendicular to the major axis of the bar (x_2). We explore a large range of
barred galaxy potentials and for each potential we use a two-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulation to determine whether and at what radius a nuclear ring
forms. We compare the results of the hydrodynamic simulations to numerical
integrations of periodic orbits in a barred potential and show that the rings
only form when a minimum amount of x_2 orbits exists. Because the rings migrate
inwards with time as they accumulate gas, the radius at which a nuclear ring is
seen does not give direct information on the shape of the rotation curve. We
also show that the common assumption that nuclear rings are related to an inner
Lindblad resonance is incorrect. In fact, we show that there is no RESONANCE at
the inner Lindblad resonance in barred galaxies. We also compare the

that heavy element diffusion is inhibited in the surface layers of metal poor

between O and Na abundances, observed in other metal poor globular clusters, is
not detected in our sample, but it may be hidden among stars with only upper

similar to those of M71, with the possible exception of the neutron capture

difficulties in the analysis. As in M71, the alpha-elements Mg, Ca, Si and Ti

from smaller sizes at a constant high density, possible behind turbulent

where massive stars with the same or greater space density are more strongly
interacting than the Ophiuchus MCS. As a result, the density contrast for MCS
must be larger in massive clusters than it is in Ophiuchus, or significant
coalescence will occur in the protostellar phase, possible forming a massive

quasar is at a redshift z=2.61 and shows a very large X-ray absorbing column of
N_H approx 3.10^23 cm^-2. This contrasts with the relatively small amount of
dust reddening, implying a gas-to-dust ratio along the line-of-sight a hundred
times greater than that of the Milky Way. The radio galaxy at z=1.57 shows only
narrow emission lines, but has a surprisingly soft X-ray spectrum. The softness
of this spectrum either indicates an unusually low gas-to-dust ratio for the

neutrino emission is below the sensitivity of existing and planned neutrino
telescopes. Ultra-high energy neutrons produced in pion photoproduction
interactions decay into protons after escaping from the host galaxy. Because
energetic protons are deflected by the intergalactic magnetic field, the
protons from the decay of neutrons emitted in all directions, including along
the jet axis where the Doppler factor and hence emitted neutron energies are
higher, can contribute to the observed ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We
consider the propagation of these cosmic ray protons to Earth and conclude that
M87 could account for the observed flux if the extragalactic magnetic field

show from the present 2D numerical simulations that the emergent luminosity
L_SED,which is the frequency integration of spectral energy distribution (SED),
depends strongly on the inclination of the system i, whereas the peak flux is
insensitive to i. Based on this result, we introduce a novel indicator f_L,
which is the ratio of L_SED to the peak flux, as a good measure for the
inclination. By using f_L, we can determine the inclination regardless of the
other physical parameters. The inclination would be determined by f_L within
the accuracy of +- 5 degree, if the opening angle of bipolar outflows is
specified by any other procedure. Since this spectrophotometric method is
easier than a geometrical method or a full SED fitting method, this method
could be a powerful tool to investigate the feature of protostars statistically

local and high redshift universe to show that there was much more dust in
galaxies in the past. We find that a large proportion of the missing metals are
traced by this dust, bringing the metals implied from the star formation
history and observations into agreement. We also show that the observed
distribution of dust masses at high redshift can be reproduced remarkably well
by a simple model for the evolution of dust in spheroids, suggesting that the
descendants of the dusty galaxies found in the deep submm surveys are the
relatively dust-free spiral bulges and ellipticals in the universe today.

galaxies, and are intrinsically more luminous than non-HBLR S2s. The level of
obscuration and circumnuclear star formation, however, appear to be similar
between HBLR and non-HBLR S2 galaxies, based on an examination of various
observational indicators. HBLR S2s, on average, share many similar large-scale,
presumably isotropic, characteristics with Seyfert 1 galaxies (S1s), as would
be expected if the unified model is correct, while non-HBLR S2s generally do
not. The active nuclear engines of non-HBLR S2s then, appear to be truly weaker

another direction. There is also evidence that the fraction of detected HBLR

model exist in the itinerant Bloch states at temperatures below about half of
the characteristic phonon frequency. Depending on the ratio of the inter-site

a polaronic Fermi (or Luttinger) liquid, bipolaronic high-Tc superconductor, or

chain with the finite range electron-phonon interaction and a zig-zag ladder.
Charge carriers in the ladder are superlight mobile intersite bipolarons. They
propagate coherently without emission or absorption of phonons with about the
same mass as single polarons. The model describes key features of the cuprates,
in particular their Tc values, different isotope effects, normal state

quantum kinetic equation. Linearizing the Lenard-Balescu collision integral
with the extension to include external field dependences allows one to
calculate the conductivity with diagrams beyond the GW approximation including
maximally crossed lines. Consequently the weak localization correction as an
interference effect appears here from the field dependence of the collision
integral (the latter dependence sometimes called intra-collisional field
effect). It is shown that this weak localization correction has the same origin
as the Debye-Onsager relaxation effect in plasma physics. The approximation is
applied to a system of quasi two-dimensional electrons in hetero-junctions
which interact with charged and neutral impurities and the low temperature
correction to the conductivity is calculated analytically. It turns out that
the dynamical screening due to charged impurities leads to a linear temperature
dependence, while the scattering from neutral impurities leads to the usual
Fermi-liquid behavior. By considering an appropriate mass action law to
determine the ratio of charged to neutral impurities we can describe the
experimental metal-insulator transition at low temperatures as a Mott-Hubbard
transition.

from 2e is related to correlations among pairs. This is exemplified by the

performs better than the cross-correlation statistic when the background is
sufficiently non-Gaussian. For both ground and space based detectors, this
results in a gain factor, ranging roughly from 1 to 3, in the minimum
gravitational-wave energy density necessary for detection, depending on the
duty cycle of the background. Our analysis is exploratory, as we assume that
the time structure of the events cannot be resolved, and we assume white,
Gaussian noise in two collocated, aligned detectors. Before this detection
method can be used in practice with real detector data, further work is
required to generalize our analysis to accommodate separated, misaligned

hard exclusive processes open a possibility for direct ""measurements"" of strong
forces in different parts of nucleons and nuclei. Also such studies open a

not give rise to dark energy, but are rather a negligible contribution to dark
matter. By (relativistic) dark matter we mean that the relation between
pressure and energy density is $p=\frac13 u$, while dark energy is
characterized by $p=-u$. A possible source of dark energy are the fluctuations
in quantum fields, including quantum gravity, inhabiting extra compactified
dimensions. These fluctuations have been computed for some simple geometries,
such as $S^2$, $S^4$, and $S^6$. If the extra dimensions are too small, they
would give rise to a dark energy larger than that observed, whereas if they are
too large they would be in conflict with experimental tests of Newton's law.
This notion suggests that the size of the extra dimensions is of order 100
$\mu$m. If the limit on the size of extra dimensions becomes lower than this
bound, extra dimensions probably do not exist, and another source for
cosmological dark energy will have to be found.

a disk across which the metric components fail to be smooth. By considering the
Hawking and Ellis extended interpretation of the KN spacetime, it is shown
first that, similarly to the electron-positron system, this solution presents
four inequivalent classical states. Next, it is shown that due to the
topological structure of the extended KN spacetime it does admit states with
half-integral angular momentum. This last property is corroborated by the fact
that, under a rotation of the space coordinates, those inequivalent states
transform into themselves only after a 4pi rotation. As a consequence, it
becomes possible to naturally represent them in a Lorentz spinor basis. The
state vector representing the whole KN solution is then constructed, and its
evolution is shown to be governed by the Dirac equation. The KN solution can
thus be consistently interpreted as a model for the electron-positron system,
in which the concepts of mass, charge and spin become connected with the
spacetime geometry. Some phenomenological consequences of the model are
explored.

double-well potential, in particular, when the scattering lengths in the
condensates have arbitrary magnitudes and opposite signs. The solitons are
found to exist everywhere where they are permitted by the dispersion law. Using
the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion and numerical methods, we show that, except
for small regions in the parameter space, the solitons are stable to small
perturbations. Some of them feature self-trapping of almost all the atoms in
the condensate with no atomic interaction or weak repulsion coupled to the
self-attractive condensate. An unusual bifurcation is found, when the soliton
bifurcates from the zero solution without a visible jump in the shape, but with
a jump in the number of trapped atoms. By means of numerical simulations, it is
found that, depending on values of the parameters and the initial perturbation,
unstable solitons either give rise to breathers or completely break down into
incoherent waves (""radiation""). A version of the model with the self-attraction
in both components, which applies to the description of dual-core fibers in
nonlinear optics, is considered too, and new results are obtained for this much
studied system.

the concept of an oblique-basis shell-model theory. The method is applied to
nuclei by combining traditional spherical shell-model states with SU(3)
collective configurations. An application to $^{24}$Mg, using the realistic
two-body interaction of Wildenthal, is used to explore the validity of this
oblique-basis, mixed-symmetry shell-model concept. The applicability of the
theory to the lower pf-shell nuclei $^{44-48}$Ti and $^{48}$Cr using the
Kuo-Brown-3 interaction is also discussed. While these nuclei show strong SU(3)
symmetry breaking due mainly to the single-particle spin-orbit splitting, they
continue to yield enhanced B(E2) values not unlike those expected if the
symmetry were not broken. Other alternative basis sets are considered for
future oblique-basis shell-model calculations. The results suggest that an
oblique-basis, mixed-symmetry shell-model theory may prove to be useful in
situations where competing degrees of freedom dominate the dynamics.

and volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in urban
environments are derived directly from data of long-term routine measurements
of NOx, VOC, and total suspended particulate matter (PM). The main idea of the
method used for the analysis is creation of special empirical models based on
artificial neural networks. These models which are in essence the nonlinear
extension of commonly used linear statistical models are believed to provide
the best fit for the real (nonlinear) PM-NOx-VOC relationships under different
atmospheric conditions. It is believed that such models may be useful in
context of various scientific and practical problems concerning atmospheric
aerosols. The method is demonstrated by the example of two empirical models
created with independent data-sets collected at two air quality monitoring
stations at South Coast Air Basin, California. It is shown that in spite of
considerable distance between the monitoring stations (more than 50 km) and
thus substantially different environmental conditions, the empirical models
manifest several common qualitative features. Specifically, it is found that,
under definite conditions, the decrease of the level of NOx or VOC may lead to
the increase of mass concentration of aerosol. It is argued that these features
are caused by the nonlinear dependence of hydroxyl radical on VOC and NOx.

  Reconsideration of Foundations,"" edited by A. Khrennikov",,,,"quant-ph",,"  What Niels Bohr called the `epistemological lesson' of `complementarity' was
the result of reasoning analogically from the classical conception of a
mechanical state to a new quantum mechanical conception of an `object' in a
mechanical state. Bohr proposed to redefine the `objectivity' essential for
scientific description in terms of the epistemological demand for unambiguously
communicable descriptions of observational results, a move which has profound
consequences for how we can understand the concept of the quantum mechanical
state and the nature of the `system' which is `in' this state. Here it is
argued that the old notion of the `object' which is in a classical mechanical
state is drawn from a substance/property ontology derived from Aristotle's
analysis of categorical propositions. In moving to describing a system in a
quantum mechanical state, the system that is `in' such a state can no longer be
so regarded as a substance possessing properties. Bohr argues that the concept
refers to an interaction which has a feature of wholeness or `individuality'
that implies that the distinction between `object system' and `observing
system' is relative to the context of the description. This conclusion, in
turn, implies the need for a combination of complementary modes of description;
however, because of his reticence in making ontological claims, he failed to
develop this dimension of his new framework of complementarity.
