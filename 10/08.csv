lenses to constrain the equation-of-state parameter w of the dark energy. Here
we solve the spherical-collapse model with dark energy, clarifying some
ambiguities found in the literature, and provide fitting formulas for the
overdensity at virialization and the linear-theory overdensity at collapse. We
then compute the variation in the predicted weak-lens abundance with w. We find
that the predicted redshift distribution and number count of weak lenses are
highly degenerate in w and \Omega_0. If we fix \Omega_0 the number count for
w=-2/3 is a factor of 2 smaller than for the \LambdaCDM model. However, if we
allow \Omega_0 to vary with w such that the amplitude of the matter power
spectrum as measured by COBE matches that obtained from the X-ray cluster
abundance, the decrease in the predicted lens abundance is less than 25% for -1
< w < -0.4. We show that a more promising method for constraining the dark
energy---one that is largely unaffected by the \Omega_0 - w degeneracy as well
as uncertainties in observational noise---is to compare the relative abundance
of virialized X-ray lensing clusters with the abundance of non-virialized,
X-ray underluminous, lensing halos. For aperture sizes of 15 arcmin, the
predicted ratio of the non-virialized to virialized lenses is greater than 40%
and varies by 20% between w=-1 and w=-0.6. Overall, if all other weak lensing
parameters are fixed, a survey must cover > 40 degree^2 in order for the number
count to differentiate a \LambdaCDM cosmology from a w=-0.9 model to 3\sigma.
However, given uncertainties in the lensing parameters, the non-virialized lens
fraction provides the most robust constraint on w, requiring 50 degree^2 of sky
coverage in order to differentiate w=-1 from w=-0.6 to 3\sigma.

  From these, we derive limits on the slopes of the central mass distributions.
Assuming the density distributions of dark matter halos follow a power-law at
small radii, rho(r)~r^(-alpha), we find inner slopes in the range 0<alpha<1 for
most galaxies. In general, halos with constant density cores (\alpha=0) provide
somewhat better fits, but the majority of our galaxies (~75%) are also
consistent with alpha=1, provided that the R-band mass-to-light ratios are
smaller than about 2. Halos with alpha=1.5, however, are ruled out in virtually
every case. To investigate the robustness of these results we discuss and model
several possible causes of systematic errors including non-circular motions,
slit width, seeing, and slit alignment errors. Taking the associated
uncertainties into account, we conclude that even for the 25% of the cases
where alpha=1 seems inconsistent with the rotation curves, we cannot rule out
cusp slopes this steep. Inclusion of literature samples similar to the one
presented here leads to the same conclusion when possible systematic errors are
taken into account. In the ongoing debate on whether the rotation curves of
dwarf and LSB galaxies are consistent with predictions for a CDM universe, we
argue that our sample and the literature samples discussed in this paper
provide insufficient evidence to rule out halos with alpha=1. At the same time,
we note that none of the galaxies in these samples require halos with steep
cusps, as most are equally well or better explained by constant density cores.

the case of dust matter on the brane, the difference between the best-fit
general relativistic model with a $\Lambda$-term \cite{Perlmutter99} and the
best-fit brane models becomes detectable for redshifts $z > 0.6$. It is
interesting that brane models predict brighter galaxies for such redshifts
which is in agreement with the measurement of the $z = 1.7$ supernova
\cite{Riess01} and with the New Data from the High Z Supernovae Search Team
\cite{schmit02}. We also demonstrate that the fit to supernovae data can also
be obtained, if we admit the ""super-negative"" dark energy $p = - (4/3) \varrho$
on the brane, where the dark energy in a way mimics the influence of the
cosmological constant. It also appears that the dark energy enlarges the age of
the universe which is demanded in cosmology. Finally, we propose to check for
dark radiation and brane tension by the application of the angular diameter of
galaxies minimum value test.

(1997, D97) that shows the radial M/L profile in Fokker-Planck models of M15.
We discuss how this modifies the interpretation of our kinematical data. These
imply the existence of a dark and compact mass component near the center of
M15, either a single black hole (BH) or a collection of dark remnants that have
sunk to the cluster center due to mass segregation. We previously showed that
the latter interpretation is in conflict with the D97 M/L profile, which
supported the BH interpretation. We repeat our analysis here with the corrected
D97 profile. Models without a BH are now found to be statistically acceptable
(within 1-sigma), although inclusion of a BH still provides a marginally better
fit. It does not necessarily follow that dark remnants are now the preferred
interpretation of the data. The D97 models, as well as N-body models by
Baumgardt et al. (2002), assume that all neutron stars are retained during
cluster evolution. This conflicts with predictions of the neutron-star
retention rate (typically below 10 per cent) based on pulsar kick velocities.
The presence of a single BH therefore continues to be a viable interpretation
of the data. The best fit BH mass with the corrected D97 M/L profile is M_BH =
1.7^{+2.7}_{-1.7} x 10^3 solar masses, and with a constant M/L it is M_BH =
3.2^{+2.2}_{-2.2} x 10^3 solar masses. A model that includes both neutron star
escape and mass segregation would probably yield a value between these numbers.
This agrees with the correlation between velocity dispersion and BH mass
inferred for galaxies. However, with the presently available models and data it
is neither uniquely implied nor ruled out that M15 has an intermediate-mass BH.

numerics, and exploring the effect of a linear shear. We make use of both
compressible MHD simulations and synthetic data to emulate spectroscopic
observations and test the technique. With the same synthetic spectroscopic
data, we also studied anisotropies of the two point statistics and related
those anisotropies with the magnetic field direction. This presents a new
technique for magnetic field studies. The results show that the velocity and
density spectral indices measured are consistent with the analytical
predictions. We identified the dominant source of error with the limited number
of data points along a given line of sight. We decrease this type of noise by
increasing the number of points and by introducing Gaussian smoothing. We argue
that in real observations the number of emitting elements is essentially
infinite and that source of noise vanishes.

radio data indicate clearly that HCG~54 is a product of a recent merger
involving at least two galaxies. Our optical images have revealed a blue
elongated structure associated with HCG 54a embedded in a rounder and redder
stellar envelope. Several ripples or shells whose center is located near HCG
54a and b are also detected. These observed features are similar to those found
in the numerical simulations of tidal interactions involving two equal mass
disk galaxies. This system is embedded in an HI cloud 12 kpc in diameter, and a
20 kpc HI tidal tail emerges from its western edge. Both the HI distribution
and kinematics are consistent with a recent history of a deeply penetrating
interaction or a merger. Based on the analysis of our new data we propose that
HCG 54 is the remnant of a merger in an advanced stage, whose main body is what
has been called HCG 54a, while HCG 54b marks the location of a strong starburst
induced by the interaction, as evidenced by the Wolf Rayet stellar population

established for stars in the sample; flux and distance led to values for
effective temperature, and linear radius, respectively. Additionally, values
for the K-[12] color excess were established for these stars, which is
indicative of dusty mass loss. Stars with higher color excess are shown to be
systematically 120 solar radii larger than their low color excess counterparts,

resultant sizes of these stars in the context of pulsation mode is consistent

unambiguous for more than ~90% of our HI galaxies. The galaxies appear to be
embedded in a sheet at the cluster velocity which extends for more than 30 deg
across the search area. At the nominal cluster distance of ~20 Mpc, this
corresponds to an elongated structure more than 10 Mpc in extent. A velocity
gradient across the structure is detected, with radial velocities increasing by
\~500 km/s from SE to NW. The clustering of galaxies evident in optical surveys
is only weakly suggested in the spatial distribution of our HI detections. Our
results suggest a considerable deficit of HI-rich galaxies in the centre of the

HI-rich galaxies in the outer parts of the cluster where galaxies may be
infalling towards the cluster for the first time.

details, see Ryde et al. (2002)]. Arcturus, or alpha Bootes is, with its
effective temperature of 4300 K, the hottest star yet to show water vapor
features. We argue that the water vapor is photospheric and that its detection
provides us with new insights into the outer parts of the photosphere. We are
not able to model the vater vapor with a standard, one-component, 1D,
radiative-equilibrium, LTE model photosphere, which probably means we are
lacking essential physics in such models. However, we are able to model several
OH lines of different excitation and the water-vapor lines satisfactorily after
lowering the temperature structure of the very outer parts of the photosphere
at log tau_500=-3.8 and beyond compared to a flux-constant, hydrostatic,
standard marcs model photosphere. Our new semi-empirical model is consistently
calculated from the given temperature structure. I will discuss some possible
reasons for a temperature decrease in the outer-most parts of the photosphere
and the assumed break-down of the assumptions made in classical
model-atmosphere codes. In order to understand the outer photospheres of these
objects properly, we will, most likely, need 3D hydrodynamical models of red

convenient first approximation to stellar dynamics, and its derivation from the
kinetic theory is standard. The challenge lies in providing adequate closure
approximations for the higher-order moments of the phase-space density function
that appear in the fluid dynamical equations. Such closure approximations may
be found using representations of the phase-space density as embodied in the
kinetic theory. In the classic approach of Chapman and Enskog, one is led to
the Navier-Stokes equations, which are known to be inaccurate when the mean
free paths of particles are long, as they are in many stellar systems. To
improve on the fluid description, we derive here a modified closure relation
using a Fokker-Planck collision operator. To illustrate the nature of our
approximation, we apply it to the study of gravitational instability. The
instability proceeds in a qualitative manner as given by the Navier-Stokes

diffusive processes through the finer and gel pores are considered. The fitting
of the model by computerized methods enables us to determine the parameters
that characterize the process: i. e. the sorptivity coefficient (S) and
diffusion coefficient (D). This allows the description of the process for all
times and offers the possibility to know the contributions of both, the
diffusive and capillary processes. The results show the influence of the curing
regime and the preheating temperature on the behavior of GGBS mortars.

description of the quantum Hall effect(QHE) at the filling factor
$\nu=p/(2pq\pm 1)$, and show that the successful composite-fermions(CF) theory
of Jain acquires a solid theoretical basis, which we call particle-flux
separation(PFS). PFS can be studied efficiently by a gauge theory and
characterized as a deconfinement phenomenon in the corresponding gauge
dynamics. The PFS takes place at low temperatures, $T \leq T_{\rm PFS}$, where
each electron or CS fermion splinters off into two quasiparticles, a fermionic
chargeon and a bosonic fluxon. The chargeon is nothing but Jain's CF, and the
fluxon carries $2q$ units of CS fluxes. At sufficiently low temperatures $T
\leq T_{\rm BC} (< T_{\rm PFS})$, fluxons Bose-condense uniformly and (partly)
cancel the external magnetic field, producing the correlation holes. This
partial cancellation validates the mean-field theory in Jain's CF approach.
FQHE takes place at $T < T_{\rm BC}$ as a joint effect of (i) integer QHE of
chargeons under the residual field $\Delta B$ and (ii) Bose condensation of
fluxons. We calculate the phase-transition temperature $T_{\rm PFS}$ and the CF
mass. PFS is a counterpart of the charge-spin separation in the t-J model of
high-$T_{\rm c}$ cuprates in which each electron dissociates into holon and
spinon. Quasiexcitations and resistivity in the PFS state are also studied. The
resistivity is just the sum of contributions of chargeons and fluxons, and
$\rho_{xx}$ changes its behavior at $T = T_{\rm PFS}$, reflecting the change of
quasiparticles from chargeons and fluxons at $T < T_{\rm PFS}$ to electrons at
$T_{\rm PFS} < T$.

can be used in a range of applications. In this paper we give an introduction
to the SET and present a full quantum mechanical calculation of how noise is
generated in the SET over the full frequency range, including a new formula for
the quantum current noise. The calculation agrees well with the shot noise
result in the low frequency limit, and with the Nyquist noise in the high
frequency limit. We discuss how the SET and in particular the radio-frequency
SET can be used to read out charge based qubits such as the single Cooper pair
box. We also discuss the backaction which the SET will have on the qubit. The
back action is determined by the spectral power of voltage fluctuations on the
SET island. We will mainly treat the normal state SET but many of the results
are also valid for superconducting SETs.

the genuinely fermionic nature of the one-particle Green's function, we employ
the fermionic formulation of the QTM based on the fermionic R-operator of the

reflects the k_F (= pi/2) oscillations of the one-particle Green's function at
half-filling. By solving numerically the Bethe Ansatz equations with Trotter
numbers up to N=10240, we obtain accurate data for the correlation length at
finite temperatures down into the very low temperature region. The correlation
length remains finite even at T=0 due to the existence of the charge gap. Our

expression for the correlation length at T=0.

These multicultural attractors are not local minima of the potential, so that
any small perturbation initiates the search for the optimum state. Cultural
drift is modelled by such perturbations acting at a finite rate. If the noise
rate is small, the system reaches the optimum monocultural state. However, if
the noise rate is above a critical value, that depends on the system size,

relative to the third law in the case of black holes of the Kerr-Newman family.
In the light of the standard proof of the equivalence between the

law it is remarked that the unattainability has a special character in black
hole thermodynamics. Also the zero temperature limit which obtained in the case
of very massive black holes is discussed and it is shown that a violation of
the entropic version in the charged case occurs. The violation of the
Bekenstein-Hawking law in favour of zero entropy S_E=0 in the case of extremal
black holes is suggested as a natural solution for a possible violation of the
second law of thermodynamics. Thermostatic arguments in support of the
unattainability are explored, and $S_E=0$ for extremal black holes is shown to
be again a viable solution. The third law of black hole dynamics by W.Israel is
then interpreted as a further strong corroboration to the picture of a
discontinuity between extremal states and non-extremal ones.

action and Wilson fermion action are adopted. A coupling constant $\beta$ is
set to 4.8 and three kinds of hopping parameter, $\kappa$=0.1846, 0.1874 and
0.1891 are assayed. The disconnected diagram in the propagator is evaluated
through taking average over 500 or 1000 Z2 noise. Simulations with the larger
hopping parameter provide us with less noisy results. Though the statistics is
not yet enough, our results indicate the existence of a pole with a mass in
almost the same order as that of the $\rho$.

+ X, if treated in the zero-binding approximation, suggest a value of the
strong coupling constant much smaller than the value implied in the standard
model by running from measurements at the Z. Thus, assuming the standard model
is correct in the low energy region, there must be very substantial
relativistic binding corrections to these processes. We discuss the wave
function factor appearing in covariant treatments of quarkonium production and
decay processes with special attention to the way in which the spin of the
quarks carries over into the spin of the bound state. We find that Lorentz
covariance requires that the bound state be a superposition of free quark and
antiquark spinors notably different from the usual ones. We resolve a
superficial apparent paradox suggesting that the relative momentum of the

for the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in QCD with emphasizing the
importance of the scale ambiguity. Previous calculation done so far naively
used one-loop MSbar coupling in the improved ladder SD equation without
examining the scale ambiguity. As a result, the calculated pion decay constant
f_\pi was less than a half of its experimental value f_\pi=92.4MeV once the QCD
scale is fixed from the high energy coupling \alpha_s(M_Z). In order to settle
the ambiguity in a proper manner, we adopt here in the present paper the
next-to-leading-order effective coupling instead of a naive use of the MSbar
coupling. The pion decay constant f_\pi is then calculated from high energy QCD
coupling strength \alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1172 \pm 0.0020. Within the
Higashijima-Miransky approximation, we obtain f_\pi=85--106MeV depending on the
value of \alpha_s(M_Z) which agrees well with the experimentally observed value
f_\pi=92.4MeV. The validity of the improved ladder SD equation is therefore
ascertained more firmly than considered before.

condition into the framework of the renormalization group method. More
precisely, the analyticity requirement is explicitly imposed on the
perturbative expansion of the $\beta$ function for restoring its correct
analytic properties. The model possesses a number of profitable features.
Namely, the analytic invariant charge has no unphysical peculiarities at any
loop level; it contains no free parameters; it incorporates ultraviolet
asymptotic freedom with infrared enhancement; it has universal behavior both in
ultraviolet and infrared regions at any loop level; it possesses a good higher
loop and scheme stability. There is considerable difference between the
respective values of analytic invariant charge in the low-energy domain of
spacelike and timelike regions. The approach proposed enables one to describe
various strong interaction processes both of perturbative and intrinsically
non-perturbative nature.

between the observed and predicted spectra constrains the mass of the heaviest

presently unknown quantities, such as the amount of relic neutrino clustering,
the universal photon radio background and the extragalactic magnetic field.
Considering different possibilities for the ordinary cosmic rays the required
neutrino masses are determined. In the most plausible case that the ordinary
cosmic rays are of extragalactic origin and the universal radio background is
strong enough to suppress high energy photons, the required neutrino mass is
0.08 eV < m_nu < 0.40 eV. The required ultrahigh energy neutrino flux should be

entirely unstable even for a small perturbation in the Poincare coordinate

and disturbance are independent of the state of the measured object. A
generalization of Heisenberg's relation proven valid for arbitrary measurements
is proposed and reveals two distinct types of possible violations of
Heisenberg's relation.

show that it is proportional to the number of decoherence ""events"" occuring

is separable.The solution of the integral equation can be written in terms of
the harmonic oscillator wave functions. The ground state wave function of the

algebras, and discussed well known applications to product operator formalism
in NMR, Jordan-Wigner construction in fermionic quantum computations. It is

  Hungary, July, 2002)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The major conceptual difficulties of quantum mechanics are analyzed. They
are: the notion ""wave-particle"", the probabilistic interpretation of the
Schroedinger wave \psi-function and hence the probability amplitude and its
phase, long-range action, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, etc. The
probabilistic formalism is developed in the phase space, but not in the real
one. Elimination of the difficulties is likely if we are able to develop
quantum mechanics in the real space. Such a theory in fact can be constructed,
however, it should proceed from deepest first principles starting from the
notion of a 4D space-time, the notion of a massive particle in the space, the
principles of the motion of a particle, etc. The theory should be characterized
by short-range action that automatically means the introduction of a quantum
mechanical force. It is shown that the aforementioned force makes it evident
and, moreover, is able to appear on the macroscopic scale. A simple experiment,
the express test, which in fact proves the macroscopic manifestation of quantum
mechanical force, is proposed for the demonstration in the quantum curriculum.

simulate the dynamical localization of classical chaos in a system described by
the quantum sawtooth map model. The dynamics of the system is computed
efficiently up to a time $t\geq \ell$, and then the localization length $\ell$
can be obtained with accuracy $\nu$ by means of order $1/\nu^2$ computer runs,
followed by coarse grained projective measurements on the computational basis.
We also show that in the presence of static imperfections a reliable
computation of the localization length is possible without error correction up
to an imperfection threshold which drops polynomially with the number of
qubits.
