energies of $(10^{19.5}-10^{22})$ eV in extragalactic magnetic fields over 1
Gpc. We use the ORS galaxy sample, which allow us to accurately quantify the
contribution of nearby sources to the energy spectrum and the arrival
distribution, as a source model. We calculate three observable quantities,
cosmic ray spectrum, harmonic amplitude, and two point correlation function
from our data of numerical simulations. With these quantities, we compare the
results of our numerical calculations with the observation. We show that the
three observable quantities including the GZK cutoff of the energy spectrum can
be reproduced in the case that the number fraction $\sim 10^{-1.7}$ of the ORS
galaxies more luminous than -20.5 mag is selected as UHECR sources. In terms of
the source number density, this constraint corresponds to $10^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$.
However, since mean number of sources within the GZK sphere is only $\sim 0.5$
in this case, the AGASA 8 events above $10^{20.0}$ eV, which do not constitute
the clustered events with each other, can not be reproduced. On the other hand,
if the cosmic ray flux measured by the HiRes, which is consistent with the GZK
cutoff, is correct and observational features about the arrival distribution of
UHECRs are same as the AGASA, our source model can explain both the arrival
distribution and the flux at the same time. Thus, we conclude that large
fraction of the AGASA 8 events above $10^{20}$ eV might originate in the
topdown scenarios, or that the cosmic ray flux measured by the HiRes experiment
might be better. We also discuss the origin of UHECRs below $10^{20.0}$ eV
through comparisons between the number density of astrophysical source
candidates and our result ($\sim 10^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$).

kinematical structure of the core of M15, obtained with the Hubble STIS and
WFPC2 instruments, and the results of dynamical simulations carried out using
the special-purpose GRAPE-6 computer. The observations imply the presence of a
significant amount of dark matter in the cluster core. In our dynamical
simulations, neutron stars and/or massive white dwarfs concentrate to the
center through mass segregation, resulting in a sharp increase in $M/L$ toward
the center. While consistent with the presence of a central black hole, the
Hubble data can also be explained by this central concentration of stellar-mass
compact objects. The latter interpretation is more conservative, since such
remnants result naturally from stellar evolution, although runaway merging
leading to the formation of a black hole may also occur for some range of
initial conditions. We conclude that no central massive object is required to
explain the observational data, although we cannot conclusively exclude such an
object at the level of $\sim500-1000$ solar masses. Our findings are unchanged
when we reduce the assumed neutron-star retention fraction in our simulations
from 100% to 0%.

particular application, we present a simple proof and some extensions of the
main result of de Pagter and Schep [6] on the monotonicity of the measure of

options and the distribution of short-term returns on the underlying asset
ignoring transaction and other costs. We compute the risk-neutral probability
density conditional on the total variance of the asset's returns when the
option expires. If the asset's future price has finite expectation, the
option's fair value satisfies a parabolic partial differential equation of the
Black-Scholes type in which the variance of the asset's returns rather than a
trading time is the evolution parameter. By immunizing the portfolio against
large-scale price fluctuations of the asset, the valuation of options is
extended to the realistic case\cite{St99} of assets whose short-term returns
have finite variance but very large, or even infinite, higher moments. A
dynamic Delta-hedged portfolio that is statically insured against exceptionally
large fluctuations includes at least two different options on the asset. The
fair value of an option in this case is determined by a universal drift
function that is common to all options on the asset. This drift is interpreted
as the premium for an investment exposed to risk due to exceptionally large
variations of the asset's price. It affects the option valuation like an
effective cost-of-carry for the underlying in the Black-Scholes world would.
The derived pricing formula for options in realistic markets is arbitrage free
by construction. A simple model with constant drift qualitatively reproduces
the often observed volatility -skew and -term structure.

for the purpose of strong coupling between single photons and atoms in cavity
quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED). Within our current understanding of the
loss mechanisms of the WGMs, the saturation photon number, n, and critical atom
number, N, cannot be minimized simultaneously, so that an ""optimal"" sphere size
is taken to be the radius for which the geometric mean, (n x N)^(1/2), is
minimized. While a general treatment is given for the dimensionless parameters
used to characterize the atom-cavity system, detailed consideration is given to
the D2 transition in atomic Cesium (852nm) using fused-silica microspheres, for
which the maximum coupling coefficient g/(2*pi)=750MHz occurs for a sphere
radius a=3.63microns corresponding to the minimum for n=6.06x10^(-6). By
contrast, the minimum for N=9.00x10^(-6) occurs for a sphere radius of
a=8.12microns, while the optimal sphere size for which (n x N)^(1/2) is
minimized occurs at a=7.83microns. On an experimental front, we have fabricated
fused-silica microspheres with radii a=10microns and consistently observed
quality factors Q=0.8x10^(7). These results for the WGMs are compared with
corresponding parameters achieved in Fabry-Perot cavities to demonstrate the
significant potential of microspheres as a tool for cavity QED with strong
coupling.
