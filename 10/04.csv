unable to flatten the cusp. Short bars form in models with quasi-flat rotation

the continuous concentration of mass within the disk as the bar grows actually
compresses the halo further, overwhelming any density reduction due to the
modest angular momentum transfer to the halo. Thus the Weinberg-Katz proposed
solution to the non-existence of the predicted cuspy halos from CDM simulations
would seem to be unworkable. I also find that the concerns over the performance
of N-body codes raised by these authors do not apply to the methods used here.

a gas of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP's) and a radiative gas made
up of a ``tightly coupled'' mixture of electrons, baryons and photons from the
end of nucleosynthesis up to the duration of radiative interactions. In this
cosmic era annihilation processes are negligible, while the WIMP's only
interact gravitationally with the radiative gas and the latter behaves as a
single dissipative fluid that can be studied within a hydrodynamical framework.
Applying the full transport equations of Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics,
coupled with the field and balance equations, we obtain a set of governing
equations that becomes an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations
once the shear viscosity relaxation time is specified; assuming the latter to
be proportional to the Hubble time, the qualitative analysis indicates that
models begin in the radiation dominated epoch close to an isotropic equilibrium
point. We show how the relaxation time governs the relaxation of the models
towards an equilibrium photon entropy, leading to ``near-Eckart'' and transient
regimes associated with `abrupt' and `smooth' relaxation processes,
respectively. Assuming the WIMP particle to be a super-symmetric neutralino of
a 100$ GeV, the numerical analysis reveals that a physically plausible
evolution, compatible with a stable equilibrium state and with observed bounds
on CMB anisotropies and neutralino abundance, is only possible for models
characterized by initial conditions associated with nearly zero spatial

persistence of the sign of circular polarization, observed in some sources, is
most likely due to a small net magnetic flux generated in the central engine,
carried along the jet axis and superimposed on a highly turbulent magnetic
field. I show that the mean levels of circular and linear polarizations depend
on the number of field reversals along the line of sight and that the gradient
in Faraday rotation across turbulent regions can lead to ""correlation

Ia's, has some exploitable properties not available when other sorts of
cosmologically distant sources are lensed. One such property is that the
``standard candle'' nature of the SN at peak brightness allows a direct
determination of the lensing magnification factor for each well observed image.
Another is that the duration of an SN event is of the same order as the
differential time delays between the various lens images. The comparable time
scales of the photometric event and the time delay invite a variety of
applications, including high precision measurements of the delay and the
targeting of especially interesting phases of the explosion for intensive
observation when they appear in trailing images. As an initial exploration of
these possibilities we present calculations of SN lensing statistics in a
``concordance cosmology''. We emphasize magnification and time delay effects.
Plausible SN surveys, such as the proposed SNAP space mission, would discover
several to some tens of strongly lensed SNe Ia per year, and at least a few of
these will be at redshifts well beyond those that would be accessible via
unlensed events. The total number of such anomalously high redshift SNe Ia will
be a useful test of high redshift star formation models. SN surveys of finite
duration will, of course, miss the appearance of some images; we quantify this
selection bias. Finally, we investigate how well the appearance of trailing
images can be predicted based on various amounts of available information on
the lensing event. Knowledge of the magnification factor for the leading image
makes it possible to predict the appearance of a trailing image relatively
accurately if the lens redshift is also known. (Abridged)

is a scaling regime for the density profile of a collapsing object of mass $M$

motion is not sufficient to effectively drive structure formation in an

investigations for the adhesion model (Burgers equation with positive
viscosity), where the agglomeration is faster, and one-dimensional dynamics is
effective. We further study the mutual motion of two mass agglomerations, and

substrates, and measure the locally generated 2nd and 3rd harmonic responses.
We measure the local nonlinear response of a Tl_2Ba_2CaCu_2O_y film grown on an
MgO substrate, and observe a large response due to the enhanced current density
near the edge. We also study the local nonlinear response of a YBa_2Cu_3O_7-d
thin film grown on a bi-crystal SrTiO_3 (STO) substrate, and spatially identify
the grain boundary through higher harmonic measurements. The spatial resolution
is determined by the magnetic loop probe size. A scaling current density JNL is
extracted to quantify the magnitude of the nonlinearity of the superconductor.
Preliminary results on the nonlinear properties of some commonly used
substrates, e.g. MgO and STO, have also been obtained

of the Higgs boson, a method complementary to spin-parity measurements in
Higgs-strahlung. For a Higgs mass above the on-shell ZZ decay threshold, a
model-independent analysis can be performed, but only by making use of
additional angular correlation effects in gluon-gluon fusion at the LHC and
gamma-gamma fusion at linear colliders. In the intermediate mass range, in
which the Higgs boson decays into pairs of real and virtual Z bosons, threshold
effects and angular correlations, parallel to Higgs-strahlung, may be adopted
to determine spin and parity, though high event rates will be required for the
analysis in practice.

dynamical information can be obtained about a surface diffeomorphism from a
finite collection of periodic orbits.In this paper, we extend these results to
homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits of saddle points. These orbits are most
readily computed and studied as intersections of unstable and stable manifolds
comprising homoclinic or heteroclinic tangles in the surface. We show how to
compute a map of a one-dimensional space similar to a train-track which
represents the isotopy-stable dynamics of the surface diffeomorphism relative
to a tangle. All orbits of this one-dimensional representative are globally
shadowed by orbits of the surface diffeomorphism, and periodic, homoclinic and
heteroclinic orbits of the one-dimensional representative are shadowed by
similar orbits in the surface.By constructing suitable surface diffeomorphisms,
we prove that these results are optimal in the sense that the topological
entropy of the one-dimensional representative is the greatest lower bound for
the entropies of diffeomorphisms in the isotopy class.

gravity-capillary waves on the surface of a liquid layer flowing down an
inclined plane, with a surfactant diffusing along the layer's surface.
Actually, the model is quite general, offering a simple way to stabilize
nonlinear waves in media combining the weakly-2D dispersion of the KP type with
gain and NWS dissipation. Parallel to this, another model is introduced, whose
dissipative terms are isotropic, rather than of the NWS type. Both models
include an additional linear equation of the advection-diffusion type, linearly
coupled to the main KP-NWS equation. The extra equation provides for stability
of the zero background in the system, opening a way to the existence of stable
localized pulses. The consideration is focused on the case when the dispersive
part of the system of the KP-I type, admitting the existence of 2D localized
pulses. Treating the dissipation and gain as small perturbations and making use
of the balance equation for the field momentum, we find that the equilibrium
between the gain and losses may select two 2D solitons, from their continuous
family existing in the conservative counterpart of the model (the latter family
is found in an exact analytical form). The selected soliton with the larger
amplitude is expected to be stable. Direct simulations completely corroborate
the analytical predictions.
