Further, the microwave background radiation arises in this cosmology as
thermalized radiation from all the radiating matter in the universe. This

longer period pulsators are found only among cooler sdB stars, where they are

EC 14026 stars is effective only in hot sdB's, leaving the driving mechanism
for the deeper gravity modes in cool sdB's currently unknown. We present the

In particular, by considering velocity profiles from rigid, over flat to
Keplerian rotation, the effects of centrifugal and shear acceleration of
particles scattered by magnetic inhomogeneities are distinguished. In the case
where shear acceleration dominates, it is confirmed that power law particle
momentum solutions $f(p) \propto p^{-(3+\alpha)}$ exist, if the mean scattering
time $\tau_c \propto p^{\alpha}$ is an increasing function of momentum. We show
that for a more complex interplay between shear and centrifugal acceleration,
the recovered power law momentum spectra might be significantly steeper but
flatten with increasing azimuthal velocity due to the increasing centrifugal
effects. The possible relevance of shear and centrifugal acceleration for the
observed extended emission in AGN is demonstrated for the case of the jet in

source was at an historically average brightness and we find the hard (3-10
keV) spectrum can be well fitted by a power law of photon index gamma ~ 1.75,
together with reflection. The only feature in the hard X-ray spectrum is a
narrow emission line near 6.4 keV, with an equivalent width of ~ 60 eV. The
energy and strength of this line is consistent with fluorescence from `neutral'
iron distant from the central continuum source. We find no evidence for a broad
Fe K line, with an upper limit well below previous reports, suggesting the
inner accretion disc is now absent or highly ionised. The addition of
simultaneous BeppoSAX data allows the analysis to be extended to 200 keV,
yielding important constraints on the total reflection. Extrapolation of the
hard X-ray power law down to 0.3 keV shows a clear `soft excess' below ~ 0.7
keV. After due allowance for the effects of a complex warm absorber, measured
with the XMM-Newton RGS, we find the soft excess is better described as a
smooth upward curvature in the continuum flux below ~ 2 keV. The soft excess
can be modelled either by Comptonised thermal emission or by enhanced
reflection from the surface of a highly ionised disc.

The source quasar is assumed to be a Newtonian geometrically-thin and

result from the source crossing a caustic straight line. The main goal is to
estimate the black hole mass and the mass accretion rate in QSO 2237+0305 as

10^8 M_Sun. While the information about the central dark mass is very
interesting, the mass accretion rate is not so well constrained. The typical

imply are substantially smaller than those calculated from SCUBA dust emission
data. Furthermore, the C17O column densities are approximately constant across

most likely explanation is that CO is depleted from the central regions of
L1689B. Simple models of pre-stellar cores with an inner depleted region are
compared with the results. This enables the magnitude of the CO depletion to be
quantified and also allows the spatial extent of the freeze-out to be firmly
established. We estimate that within about 5000 AU of the centre of L1689B,

for this study was to search for systematic differences between BLRGs and their
radio-quiet counterparts, the Seyfert galaxies, whose temporal and spectral
behavior is better studied. We find that both 3C 390.3 and 3C 120 are highly
variable, but in a different way, and quantify this difference by means of a
structure function analysis. 3C 390.3 is significantly more variable than 3C
120, despite its jet larger inclination angle, implying either that the X-ray
variability is not dominated by the jet or that two different variability
processes are simultaneously at work in 3C 390.3. We performed an
energy-selected and time-resolved analysis based on the fractional variability
amplitude and found that the variability amplitude of both objects is strongly
anticorrelated with the energy. This last result, along with the correlated
change of the photon index with the X-ray continuum flux, can be qualitatively
explained within the scenario of thermal Comptonization, generally invoked for
radio-quiet active galaxies. Moreover, the time-resolved and energy-selected
fractional variability analyses show a trend opposite to that observed in
jet-dominated AGN (blazars), suggesting only a minor contribution of the jet to
the X-ray properties of BLRGs. Time-averaged spectral analysis indicates the
presence of a strong, resolved iron line with centroid at 6.4 keV and a weak
reflection component in both objects. The overall PCA+HEXTE spectra are best
fitted with the constant density ionization model of Ross & Fabian, but with a

with earthquakes behaves as a scale-free network of the Barabasi-Albert type.
The distributions of connectivities in the graphs thus constructed are found to
decay as a power law, showing a novel feature of earthquake as a complex
critical phenomenon. This result can be interpreted in view of the facts that
frequency of earthquakes with large values of moment also decays as a power law
(the Gutenberg-Richter law) and aftershocks associated with a mainshock tend to
return to the locus of the mainshock, contributing to the large degree of
connectivity of the vertex of the mainshock. It is also found that the exponent

postulate a universal suppression of the Z-nu-nu couplings by a factor of
(1-epsilon) and perform a fit to the Z-pole and NuTeV observables with epsilon
and the oblique correction parameters S and T. Compared to a fit with S and T
only, inclusion of epsilon leads to a dramatic improvement in the quality of
the fit. The values of S and T preferred by the fit can be obtained within the
SM by a simple increase in the Higgs boson mass. However, if the W mass is also
included in the fit, a non-zero U parameter becomes necessary which cannot be
supplied within the SM. The preferred value of epsilon suggests that the seesaw
mechanism may not be the reason why neutrinos are so light.

scheme-invariant area Delta(a') of the graph of the effective beta function
between the fixed points defines the length of the RG flow; ii) the minimum of
Delta(a') in the space of flows connecting the same UV and IR fixed points
defines the (oriented) distance between the fixed points; iii) in even
dimensions, the distance between the fixed points is equal to
Delta(a)=a_UV-a_IR. In even dimensions, these statements imply the inequalities
0 =< Delta(a)=< Delta(a') and therefore the irreversibility of the RG flow.
Another consequence is the inequality a =< c for free scalars and fermions (but
not vectors), which can be checked explicitly. Secondly, I elaborate a more
general axiomatic set-up where irreversibility is defined as the statement that
there exist no pairs of non-trivial flows connecting interchanged UV and IR
fixed points. The axioms, based on the notions of length of the flow, oriented
distance between the fixed points and certain ""oriented-triangle inequalities"",
imply the irreversibility of the RG flow without a global a function. I
conjecture that the RG flow is irreversible also in odd dimensions (without a
global a function). In support of this, I check the axioms of irreversibility
in a class of d=3 theories where the RG flow is integrable at each order of the
large N expansion.

Four kinds of boundary conditions constructed by combinations of periodic

to different stepwise structures of the Lyapunov spectra in each case. We show
that a spatial wavelike structure with a time-oscillation appears in the

Realizing the devastation nuclear weapons could cause and that they could be

consequences of using atomic bombs and not base their decisions on short range
military expediency alone. They met with little success. The scientists' main

Using YBCO superconducting thermometers, the noise level goes down to 2.5E-6
Keff, which is strongly limited by excess 1/f noise in the YBCO film at the
superconducting transition. The sample holder used in the 90K experiments is
built with an auxiliary heating resistor, which enables an easy and accurate

control of atomic momenta may thus be designed as quantum algorithms.

a large number of photons in the two entangled beams. We show that the results
for imaging and for the wave-particle duality features, which have been
demonstrated in the microscopic case, persist in the macroscopic domain. We
show that the quantum character of the imaging phenomena is guaranteed by the
simultaneous spatial entanglement in the near and in the far field.

for continuous variables, based on dichotomic observables. In particular, we
are interested in two cases of dichotomic observables for the light field of
continuous variables: One case is even and odd numbers of photons and the other
case is no photon and presence of photons. We analyze various observables to
give the maximum violation of Bell's inequalities for continuous-variable
states. We discuss an observable which gives the violation of Bell's inequality
for any entangled pure continuous variable state. However, it does not have to
be a maximally entangled state to give the maximal violation of Bell's
inequality. This is attributed to a generic problem of testing the quantum
nonlocality of an infinite-dimensional state using a dichotomic observable.

planar multilayer structure is given, with special emphasis on Kerr-tunable
photonic band-gap materials for single-photon emission on demand. It is shown
that the change in the density of states near a defect resonance is much more
pronounced than that one near the band edges. In particular, operation near the
band edge as suggested from a 1D analysis is little suited for controlling the
photon emission.
