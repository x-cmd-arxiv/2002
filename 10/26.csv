most distant SNe accessible to GAIA are at a redshift of 0.14 and so GAIA will
provide a huge sample of local SNe. There will be many examples of the rarer
subluminous events, over-luminous events, SNe Ib/c and SNe II-L. SNe rates will
be found as a function of galaxy type, as well as extinction and position in

described by the force-free Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation for the flux function
$\Psi(r,z)$ which labels the poloidal field lines (in cylindrical coordinates).
The GS equation involves a function $H(\Psi)$ describing the distribution of
poloidal current which is determined by the differential rotation or {\it
twist} of the disk which increases linearly with time. We numerically solve the
GS equation in a sequence of volumes of increasing size corresponding to the
expansion of the outer perfectly conducting boundaries at ($R_{m}, Z_{m}$). The
outer boundaries model the influence of an external non-magnetized plasma. The
sequence of GS solutions provides a model for the dynamical evolution of the
magnetic field in response to (1) the increasing twist of the disk and (2) the
pressure of external plasma. We find solutions with {\it magnetically
collimated} Poynting jets where there is a {\it continuous} outflow of energy,
angular momentum, and toroidal magnetic flux from the disk into the external

collisionless shock. Unlike faster shocks in SN1006 and in the heliosphere,
this shock brings oxygen ions and protons to within a factor of 2.5 of the same

than Alfv\'{e}n Mach number, may control the degree of thermal equilibration.
  We combine the O VI observations with a low resolution far UV spectrum from
HUT, an H$\alpha$ image and ROSAT PSPC X-ray data to constrain the pre-shock
density and the structure along the line-of-sight. As part of this effort, we
model the effects of resonance scattering of O VI photons within the shocked

Resonance scattering affects the O VI intensities at the factor of 2 level, and
the soft spectrum of the X-ray rim can be mostly attributed to departures from
ionization equilibrium. The pre-shock density is about twice the canonical

the vicinity of mean-motion commensurabilities. In some cases, such as the
Gliese 876 system, the planets seem to be trapped in a stationary solution, the
system exhibiting a simultaneous libration of the resonant angle theta_1 = 2
lambda_2 - lambda_1 - varpi_1 and of the relative position of the pericenters.
  In this paper we analyze the existence and location of these stable
solutions, for the 2/1 and 3/1 resonances, as function of the masses and
orbital elements of both planets. This is undertaken via an analytical model
for the resonant Hamiltonian function. The results are compared with those of
numerical simulations of the exact equations.
  In the 2/1 commensurability, we show the existence of three principal
families of stationary solutions: (i) aligned orbits, in which theta_1 and
varpi_1 - varpi_2 both librate around zero, (ii) anti-aligned orbits, in which
theta_1=0 and the difference in pericenter is 180 degrees, and (iii) asymmetric
stationary solutions, where both the resonant angle and varpi_1 - varpi_2 are
constants with values different of 0 or 180 degrees. Each family exists in a
different domain of values of the mass ratio and eccentricities of both
planets. Similar results are also found in the 3/1 resonance.
  We discuss the application of these results to the extrasolar planetary
systems and develop a chart of possible planetary orbits with apsidal
corotation. We estimate, also, the maximum planetary masses in order that the
stationary solutions are dynamically stable.

addition since at early times the frequency of the spacetime modes is much
lower than that of a cold neutron star, they would be also detectable with the

representations in different characteristics has been crucial.
  In this paper we investigate when a pair of mod p and mod q representations
of the absolute Galois group of a number field K simultaneously arises from an
{\it automorphic motive}: we do this in the 1-dimensional (Section 2) and
2-dimensional (Section 3: this time assuming $K={\mathbb Q}$) cases. In Section
3 we formulate a mod pq version of Serre's conjecture refining in part a
question of Barry Mazur and Ken Ribet.

  We use the general framework developed in Toen, Vezzosi, ``Homotopical
Algebraic Geometry I: Topos theory'', and in particular the notions of model
topology, model sites and stacks over them, in order to define various derived
moduli functors and study their geometric properties. We start by defining the
model category of D-stacks, with respect to an extension of the etale topology
to the category of non-positively graded commutative differential algebras, and
we show that its homotopy category contains interesting objects, such as
schemes, algebraic stacks, higher algebraic stacks, dg-schemes ... . We define
the notion of ``geometric D-stack'' and present some related geometric
constructions ($\mathcal{O}$-modules, perfect complexes, K-theory, derived
tangent stacks, cotangent complexes, various notion of smoothness ... .).
Finally, we define and study the derived moduli problems classifying local
systems on a topological space, vector bundles on a smooth projective variety,
and $A_{\infty}$-categorical structures. We state geometricity and smoothness
results for all of these examples.

The available experimental data are compared with calculations using accurate
nuclear wavefunctions coming from rigorous solutions of the three-nucleon
quantum mechanical equations. The dominant contributions for pion production
are obtained through matrix elements involving pion-nucleon rescattering
mechanisms in S- and P-waves. S-wave rescattering includes also an isoscalar
contribution which is enhanced because of the off-shell effects. P-wave
rescattering includes also diagrams involving explicitly the Delta degrees of
freedom. It is found that the pion-nucleon S-wave off-shell effects in the
isospin-even channel are of considerable importance. Initial-state interactions
between the proton and the deuteron have in general minor effects on the
spin-averaged and spin-dependent observables, except when the polarization
observable involves interference terms amongst the various helicity amplitudes.

described through a stochastic model. To generate this non-equilibrium process
we assume that the turn on of a electrostatic potential triggers a complex
dynamics that includes a free Brownian motion, a reaction kinetic and a
stimulated migration before the final adhesion of ions on the surface
(electrode). At, when the potential is switched on, the spatial symmetry is
broken and a two-stage process is developed. First the ion undergoes a change
in its electrochemical character (at some region of the space) and then reacts
at some specific points to stick together on the surface. The continuous
addition of ions develops a material deposit connected to the current transient
signals measured in electrochemical deposition processes. Unlike current models
found in the literature, this procedure avoids the computation of the area
covered by the diffusion zones, allowing a formalism skill to describe equally
well the absorption of ions by channels on electrified surfaces. The theory is
applied to the electrodeposition of nickel on n-silicon and explains the
failure of standard three-dimensional nucleation models to reproduce situations
where interfacial relations control the dynamics. It is shown that, processes
dominated by chemical reactions on the electrode can not be classified as
possessing an exclusively instantaneous or progressive character, rather, they
mix together these two limiting forms of nuclei activation to defines the

compare the time that a quantum cloner implemented with trapped ions requires
to produce $M$ copies from $N$ identical pure state inputs and the decoherence
time during which the probability of spontaneous emission becomes
non-negligible. We find a method to construct an $N\to M$ cloning circuit, and

states where the two parties, Alice and Bob, are allowed to manipulate their
