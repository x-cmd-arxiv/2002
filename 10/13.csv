recent work in Observational Cosmic Topology done in partial collaboration with
Armando Bernui. We address three relevant questions related to the search for
the size and shape of our Universe: (i) How do the actual observation of
multiple images of certain cosmic objects, e.g. galaxy clusters, constrain the
possible models for the shape of our Universe?, (ii) What kind of predictions
can be done once a pair of cosmic objects have been identified to be
topological images related by a translation?, and (iii) Is it possible to
determine if two regions of space are topologically identified, even when
distortions on the distributions of cosmic sources due to observational
limitations are not negligible? We give examples answering the first two
questions using the suggestion of Roukema and Edge that the clusters RXJ
1347.5-1145 and CL 09104+4109 might be topological images of the Coma cluster.
For the third question, we suggest a method based on the analysis of PSH's
noise correlations which seems to give a positive answer.

of the HII region inside the R Aquarii binary system by the code SUMA which
consistently accounts for shock and photoionization. The temperature of the hot
star results 80,000 K as for a white dwarf. We find that the shock velocity in
the NE jet increased between 1983 and 1989. The spectral evolution between 1989
and 1991 of the SW jet indicates that a larger contribution from low
density-velocity matter affects the 1991 spectra. The evolution of the UV
spectra from 8/11/1980 to 26/5/1991 in the HII region indicates that the
reverse shock is actually a standing shock. The results obtained by modelling
the line spectra are cross-checked by the fit of the continuum SED. It is found
that a black-body temperature of 2800 K reproduces the radiation from the red
giant. A black-body emission component corresponding to 1000 K is emitted by
dust in the surrounding of the red giant. Model calculations confirm that the
radio emission is of thermal origin. We found that the NE jet bulk emission is
at a distance of about 2 (15) cm from the internal system, while the distance
of the SW jet bulk is about 6 (14) cm. The distance of the reverse shock from
the hot source in the internal region is < 9 (13) cm.

We investigate in detail how the wind properties of the models are influenced
by the micro-physical properties of the dust grains that are required by the
description of grain formation. The choice of dust parameters is significant
for the derived outflow velocity, the degree of condensation and the resulting
mass loss rates of the models. In the transition region between models with and
without mass loss the choice ofmicro-physical parameters turns out to be very
significant for whether a particular set of stellar parameters will give rise
to a dust-driven mass loss or not. We also calculate near-infrared colors to
test how the dust parameters influence the observable properties of the models,
however, at this point we do not attempt to fit particular stars.

the Standard Model, possibly at the Grand Unification energy scale. A extensive
sequence of of experiments will be required to measure precisely all the
parameters of the neutrino mixing matrix, culminating with the discovery and
study of leptonic CP violation. As a first step, extensions of conventional
pion/kaon decay beams, such as off-axis beams or low-energy super-beams, have
been considered. These could yield first observations of $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$
transitions at the atmospheric frequency, which have not yet been observed, and
a first measurement of $\theta_{13}$. Experiments with much better flux control
can be envisaged if the neutrinos are obtained from the decays of stored
particles. One such possibility is the concept of beta beams provided by the
decays of radioactive nuclei, that has been developed within the context of
these studies. These would provide a pure (anti-)electron-neutrino beam of a
few hundred MeV, and beautiful complementarity with a high-intensity,
low-energy conventional beam, enabling experimental probes of T violation as
well as CP violation. Ultimately, a definitive and complete set of measurements
would offered by a Neutrino Factory based on a muon storage ring. This powerful
machine offers the largest reach for CP violation, even for very small values
of $\theta_{13}$.

framework for the formulation of physical theories and is a promising approach
for physics beyond the standard model. The book begins with a brief review of
relativity, relativistic quantum mechanics and classical gauge theories, with
the emphasis on the basic physical concepts and the mathematical foundations.
The external field problem and Klein's paradox are discussed and then resolved
by introducing the so-called fermionic projector, a global object in space-time
which generalizes the notion of the Dirac sea. The mathematical core of the
book is to give a precise definition of the fermionic projector and to employ
methods of hyperbolic differential equations for its detailed analysis. The
fermionic projector makes it possible to formulate a new type of variational
principles in space-time. The mathematical tools for the analysis of the
corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are developed. A particular variational
principle is proposed which gives rise to an effective interaction showing many
similarities to the interactions of the standard model.

students in mathematics or physics. Several appendices provide supplementary
material which will be useful to the experienced researcher.

  High Energy Physics Problems, Dubna, June 10-15, 2002",,,,"nucl-th",,"  Equation of State (EoS) for hot and dense nuclear matter with a quark-hadron
phase transition is constructed within a statistical mixed-phase model assuming
coexistence of unbound quarks in nuclear surrounding. This model predicts the
deconfinement phase transition of the crossover type. The so-called ""softest
point"" effect of EoS is analyzed and confronted to that for other equations of
state which exhibit the first order phase transition (two-phase bag model) or
no transition at all (hadron resonance gas). It is demonstrated that the beam
energy dependence of the directed flow is a smooth function in the whole range
from SIS till SPS energies and allows to disentangle different EoS, being in
good agreement with experimental data for the statistical mixed-phase model. In
contrast, excitation functions for relative strangeness abundance turn out to
be insensitive to the order of phase transition.

classical particles confined in a harmonic trap. The volume of such a trap is
not a good thermodynamic variable, so conventional expressions of the first law
of thermodynamics and the ideal gas law must be modified. I use the frequency
of oscillations about the minimum of the trap as an external parameter
characterizing the confinement, and derive elementary relations between
particle number, temperature, energy, oscillation frequency, and a generalized
pressure, that are analogous to conventional thermodynamic relations for an
ideal gas in a rigid volume. I also discuss heat capacities for trapped
particles.

model for QCD interactions. The model also explains within the same theoretical
framework hitherto purely phenomenological characteristics of the quarks like
their fractional charge, mass,handedness and confinement.

A309 (2003) 329-334","10.1016/S0375-9601(03)00209-3",,"quant-ph cond-mat hep-th",,"  The introduction of spinor and other massive fields by ``quantizing''
particles (corpuscles) is conceptually misleading. Only spatial fields must be
postulated to form the fundamental objects to be quantized (that is, to define
a formal basis for all quantum states), while apparent ``particles'' are a mere
consequence of decoherence. This conclusion is also supported by the nature of
gauge fields.
