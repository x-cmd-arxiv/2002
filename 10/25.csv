z ~ 1.9 galaxies, A2 and S2, located behind the cluster AC 114. Thanks to large
magnification factors, we have been successful in detecting rest-frame optical
emission lines in star-forming galaxies 1 to 2 magnitudes fainter than in
previous studies of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z ~ 3. From the Ha
luminosity, we estimate star formation rates (SFRs) which are 7 to 15 times
higher than those inferred from the UV continuum flux at 1500 ang without dust
extinction correction. The behavior of S2 and A2 in terms of O/H and N/O
abundance ratios are very different, and they are also different from typical
LBGs at z ~ 3. S2 is a low-metallicity object (Z ~ 0.03 Zsun) with a low N/O
ratio, similar to those derived in the most metal-poor nearby HII galaxies. In
contrast, A2 is a high-metallicity galaxy (Z ~ 1.3 Zsun) with a high N/O
abundance ratio, similar to those derived in the most metal-rich starburst
nucleus galaxies. The virial masses, derived from emission-line widths, are 0.5
and 2.4 x 10^10 Msun, for S2 and A2 respectively. Thanks to the gravitational
amplification, the line profiles of S2 are spatially resolved, leading to a
velocity gradient of +- 240 km/s, which yields a dynamical mass of ~ 1.3 x
10^10 Msun within the inner 1 kpc radius. Combining these new data with the
sample of LBGs at z ~ 3, we conclude that these three galaxies exhibit
different physical properties in terms of SFRs, abundance and mass-to-light
ratios, and reddening. High-redshift galaxies of different luminosities could
thus have quite different star formation histories (abridged version).

presented which show that the nearby (z=0.046), rich cluster of galaxies Abell
3376 is experiencing a major event of binary subcluster merger. The key
evidence is the discovery of a pair of large, optically unidentified diffuse
radio sources (`arcs'), symmetrically located about 2.6 h_{50}^{-1} Mpc apart
at the opposite ends of the hot intra-cluster gas mapped by ROSAT in X-rays. It
is argued that the gas-dynamical shock-waves, which occur naturally during
cluster formation, are accelerating charged particles (cosmic rays) to
relativistic energies, leading to synchrotron emission from the megaparsec
scale radio arcs. If this is so, cluster Abell 3376 would also be a potential
source capable of accelerating cosmic ray particles upto ultra-high energies

microlensing and its effects on stellar transit observations, with a special
emphasis on the Kepler mission. Kepler is a NASA-approved mission whose goal is
to detect a large number of extrasolar, earth-like planets by obtaining
near-continuous photometry of > 100,000 F, G, and K dwarfs for four years. The
expected photometric precision of Kepler is 90 micromag (achieved in 15 minute
samples), at which the effect of microlensing by a transiting companion can be
significant. For example, for a solar-type primary transited by a white-dwarf
secondary, the maximum depth of the transit is 0.01%, which is almost entirely
compensated by the microlensing amplification when the white dwarf is at ~0.05
AU. The combined effect of microlensing and transit increases to a net
amplification of 150 micromag at an orbital separation of 0.1 AU, and 2.4
millimag at an orbital separation of 1 AU. Thus, the effect of microlensing can
be used to break the degeneracy between a planetary-mass object for which the
microlensing effect is negligible, and a more massive object of the same size.
For brown dwarfs at orbital separations of a few AU, the effect of microlensing
is several percent of the transit depth, and hence the microlensing effect must
be taken into account in deriving the physical parameters of the brown dwarf.
The microlensing signal caused by a neutron star or a black hole in a binary
can be several millimag, far exceeding the transit depth, and potentially
detectable even from ground-based observations. Kepler will be sensitive to
white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes in binaries through their
microlensing signatures. These observations can be used to derive the frequency
of such compact objects in binaries, and to determine their masses.

More than 10% of the molecular cloud has been accelerated to high velocities by
the molecular flows (> 5.2 km/s relative to v{LSR}) and the mechanical energy
in the outflowing gas is roughly half the gravitational binding energy of the
cloud. The W75 N cluster members represent a range of evolutionary stages, from
stars with no apparent circumstellar material to deeply embedded protostars
that are actively powering massive outflows. Nine cores of
millimeter-wavelength emission highlight the locations of embedded protostars
in W75 N. The total mass of gas & dust associated with the millimeter cores
ranges from 340 Msun to 11 Msun. The infrared reflection nebula and shocked H2
emission have multiple peaks and extensions which, again, suggests the presence
of several outflows. Diffuse H2 emission extends about 0.6 parsecs beyond the
outer boundaries of the CO emission while the [FeII] emission is only detected
close to the protostars. The infrared line emission morphology suggests that
only slow, non-dissociative J-type shocks exist throughout the pc-scale
outflows. Fast, dissociative shocks, common in jet-driven low-mass outflows,
are absent in W75 N. Thus, the energetics of the outflows from the late to
early B protostars in W75 N differ from their low-mass counterparts -- they do

CS Cha has a spatial scale of ~1.5 AU, similar to that previously observed in
RU Lup, and likely be heated by a mechanism other than shocks. From the spatial

radiative cooling and a phenomenological model for star formation and
supernovae feedback, we investigate the impact of galaxy formation on the X-ray
properties of groups at redshift zero. Motivated by the observed ``break'' in
the L_x-T_x relation at kT~1-2keV, our feedback model is based on the
assumption that supernovae imprint a temperature scale on the hot gas, with the
star formation rate and corresponding reheated gas mass then depending only on
the available energy budget. We demonstrate that a strong feedback model with a
heating temperature comparable to this break (kT_=2keV), and an energy budget
twice that available from supernovae (epsilon=2), raises the core entropy of
groups sufficiently to produce an adequate match to their observed X-ray
properties. A lower value of epsilon increases the star formation rate without
significantly affecting the X-ray properties of groups, and a model with
epsilon~0.1 reproduces the observed fraction of baryons in stars. However, a
heating temperature which is lower than the virial temperatures of the groups
leads to an excess of cooling gas that boosts their X-ray luminosities, due to
the failure of the reheated material to escape from the gravitational
potential. A limited study of numerical resolution effects reveals that the
temperature of poorly-resolved objects is underestimated, therefore (in our
case) a fully-resolved group population would lead to a steeper L_x-T_x
relation, bringing our results into even better agreement with the
observations.

assumption of the existence of two different time scales in the detectors'
transient behaviour, accounting either for fast or slow detectors' response.
  The specifically developed IDL software includes: a reduction pipeline
performing basic operations such as deglitching and background determination;
the fitting procedures proper, modelling the time history of individual pixels
and detecting any flux excess with respect to the local background ascribable
to potential sources; mapping, source extraction and flux estimation
procedures; simulation procedures allowing one to estimate the errors arising
from different instrumental and reduction effects. Moreover, an easy-to-use
graphical user interface allows one to quickly browse the data and carry out
the substantial amount of interactive analysis required when the automatic fit
fails and to check the reliability of detected sources.
  This method provides source lists of great reliability and completeness and
an outstanding photometric accuracy, particularly at low redundancy levels,
where the reliability of ISO-CAM/PHOT source lists, even at moderately bright
flux levels, has been a long-standing issue.

methods is the scaling relation involved, in particular the way its intrinsic
scatter and systematic normalization are treated. For temperature derived
constraints, we use a sample adapted from HIFLUGCS, and test for several
sources of systematic error. We parameterize the mass-temperature relation with
an overall factor T_ast, with 1.5 \le T_ast \le 1.9. After marginalising over
the range of T_ast, we obtain a 68 per cent confidence range of
sigma_8=0.77^{+0.05}_{-0.04} for a standard LambdaCDM model. For luminosity
derived constraints we use the XLF from the REFLEX survey and explore how
sensitive the final results are on the details of the mass-luminosity, M-L,
conversion. Assuming a uniform systematic uncertainty of +/-20 per cent in the
amplitude of the mass-luminosity relation by Reiprich and Bohringer, we derive
sigma_8=0.79^{+0.06}_{-0.07} for the same standard LambdaCDM model. Although
the XTF and XLF derived constraints agree very well with each other, we
emphasize that such results can change by about 10--15 per cent, depending on
how uncertainties in the L-T-M conversions are interpreted and included in the
analysis. In order to achieve precision cosmology, with this probe, it is
important to separate the uncertainty in the scaling relation into its
intrinsic and overall normalization parts.

metallic rutile and the insulating monoclinic M1 phase of vanadium dioxide are
presented. In addition, the insulating M2 phase is investigated for the first
time. The density functional calculations allow for a consistent understanding
of all three phases. In the rutile phase metallic conductivity is carried by
metal t_2g orbitals, which fall into the one-dimensional d_parallel band, and
the isotropically dispersing e_g^pi bands. Hybridization of both types of bands
is weak. In the M1 phase splitting of the d_parallel band due to metal-metal
dimerization and upshift of the e_g^pi bands due to increased p-d overlap lead
to an effective separation of both types of bands. Despite incomplete opening
of the optical band gap due to the shortcomings of the local density
approximation, the metal-insulator transition can be understood as a
Peierls-like instability of the d_parallel band in an embedding background of
e_g^pi electrons. In the M2 phase, the metal-insulator transition arises as a
combined embedded Peierls-like and antiferromagnetic instability. The results
for VO2 fit into the general scenario of an instability of the rutile-type
transition-metal dioxides at the beginning of the d-series towards dimerization
or antiferromagnetic ordering within the characteristic metal chains. This
scenario was successfully applied before to MoO2 and NbO2. In the d^1
compounds, the d_parallel and e_g^pi bands can be completely separated, which
leads to the observed metal-insulator transitions.

temperature and heat exchange cannot be considered for such systems. Moreover,
for $q\ne 1$ the probability distribution for weakly interacting systems does

strong corrections to scaling for small lambda. This picture is consistent with

This contrasts with the naively expected R ~ epsilon^(-3) and the apparent

R.
  Oddly,the set of standard critical exponents is shared with the 3D spherical

vast majority of drawdowns occurring on the major financial markets have a
distribution which is well-represented by a stretched exponential, while the
largest drawdowns are occurring with a significantly larger rate than predicted
by the bulk of the distribution and should thus be characterized as outliers.
In the present analysis, the definition of drawdowns is generalised to
coarse-grained drawdowns or so-called epsilon-drawdowns and a link between such
epsilon-outliers and preceding log-periodic power law bubbles previously
identified is established.

exponent theta in spin glasses is presented. It consists in describing the
energy level spectrum in spin glasses only in terms of the properties of the
lowest energy droplets and the lowest droplet exponents (LDEs) lambda_l,theta_l
that describe the statistics of their sizes and gaps. We show how these LDEs
yield the standard thermal exponent of droplet theory theta through the
relation, theta=theta_l+d*lambda_l. The present approach provides a new way to
measure the thermal exponent theta without any assumption about the correct
procedure to generate typical low-lying excitations as is commonly done in many
perturbation methods including domain wall calculations. To illustrate the
usefulness of the method we present a detailed investigation of the properties
of the lowest energy droplets in two-dimensional Gaussian Ising spin glasses.
By independent measurements of both LDEs and an aspect-ratio analysis, we find
theta(2d) ~- 0.46(1)< theta_{DW}(2d) ~- 0.287 where theta_{DW} is the thermal
exponent obtained in domain-wall theory. We also discuss the origin of
finite-volume corrections in the behavior of the LDE theta_l and relate them to
the finite-volume corrections in the statistics of extreme values. All in all,
we show that typical large-scale droplets are not probed by most of the present
perturbation methods as they probably do not have a compact structure as has
been recently suggested.

  '02, June, 2002, Oulu, Finland",,,,"hep-ph",,"  We consider here the constraints in SUGRA models on the SUSY parameter space
due to current experimental bounds on the light Higgs mass m_h, the b-> s gamma
decay, the amount of neutralino cold dark matter Omega h^2, and the muon
magnetic moment. Models with universal soft breaking (mSUGRA) and non-universal
gaugino or Higgs masses at M_G are examined. For mSUGRA, the m_h, b->s gamma
and Omega h^2 constraints imply a lower bound on the gaugino mass of
m_{1/2}>~300GeV implying the gluino and squarks have mass >~700GeV, and the
neutralino >~120GeV. The current status of the Brookhaven muon g - 2 experiment
is reviewed, and if the Standard Model (SM) contribution evaluated using the
e^+ + e^- data is correct, a 2 sigma bound on the deviation of experiment from
the SM produces an upper bound on m_{1/2} that eliminates the ""focus point""
regions of parameter space. Dark matter (DM) detection cross sections range
from 5\times10^{-8} pb to 5\times10^{-10} pb which would be accessible to
future planned detectors. The SUSY decay B_s->\mu^+ +\mu^- is seen to be
accessible to the Tevatron Run 2B with 15 fb^{-1} luminosity for tanbeta >~30.
The most favorable signals of SUSY for linear colliders are stau pair
production and neutralino pair production, though it will require an 800GeV
machine to cover the full parameter space. Non-universal models can modify some
of the above results. Thus a non-universal (heavier) gluino mass at M_G can
significantly reduce the lower bound constraints of b\to s gamma and m_h giving
rise to a lighter SUSY spectrum. A heavier up Higgs mass can open an additional
region with allowed relic density arising from annihilation via the s-channel Z
diagram with an O(10) larger DM detector cross section.

(sub)determinant and inverse hierarchy models. We find that, not only for the
LOW or VO solutions, but even in the LA case, the hierarchical models have a
significantly better success rate than those based on anarchy. The normal
hierachy and the inverse hierarchy models have comparable performances in
models with see-saw dominance, while the inverse hierarchy models are
particularly good in the no see-saw versions. As a possible distinction between
these categories of models, the inverse hierarchy models favour a maximal solar
mixing angle and their rate of success drops dramatically as the mixing angle
decreases, while normal hierarchy models are far more stable in this respect.

from instanton physics, but we find that at two-loop the role of the zero

respectively, of a compressible fluid. In this paper, we generalize Madelung's
transformation to the quaternionic Schroedinger equation. The non-abelian
nature of the full SU(2) gauge group of this equation leads to a richer, more
intricate set of fluid equations than those arising from complex quantum
mechanics. We begin by describing the quaternionic version of Madelung's
transformation, and identifying its ``hydrodynamic'' variables. In order to
find Hamiltonian equations of motion for these, we first develop the canonical
Poisson bracket and Hamiltonian for the quaternionic Schroedinger equation, and
then apply Madelung's transformation to derive non-canonical Poisson brackets
yielding the desired equations of motion. These are a particularly natural set
of equations for a non-abelian fluid, and differ from those obtained by
Bistrovic et al. only by a global gauge transformation. Because we have
obtained these equations by a transformation of the quaternionic Schroedinger
equation, and because many techniques for simulating complex quantum mechanics
generalize straightforwardly to the quaternionic case, our observation leads to
simple algorithms for the computer simulation of non-abelian fluids.

several temperatures in the range $142.6<T<200$ K, encompassing the critical
temperature Tc=150.86 K. We report here measurements at densities up to N?7
nm$^{-3}$, close to the critical density, $N_c \approx$ 8.1 nm$^{-3}$, reached
for the isotherm closest to the critical one. At all temperatures, below as
well as above Tc, and up to moderately high densities, the density-normalized
mobility $\mu N$ shows the usual electric field dependence present in a gas
with a Ramsauer-Townsend minimum due to the mainly attractive electron-atom
interaction. mN is constant and field independent for small values of $E,$
shows a maximum for a reduced field $E/N \approx$ 4 mTd, and then decreases
rapidly with the field, approximately proportional to $(E/N)^{-1/2}.$ The
zero-field density-normalized mobility $\mu_0 N, $for all T>$T_c,$ shows the
well known anomalous positive density effect, i.e., m0N increases with
increasing N, confirming previous results obtained for T=300 K and 162.7 K.
Below Tc, however, $\mu_0 N$ does not show the expected anomalous positive
density effect, but it rather features a broad maximum. This appears to be a
crossover behavior between the positive density effect shown for T>Tc and the
small negative effect previously observed for T$\approx$ 90 K. In any case, the
data at all temperatures confirm the interpretation of the anomalous density
effect as being essentially due by the density-dependent quantum shift of the
electron ground state kinetic energy in a disordered medium as a result of
multiple scattering (MS) processes, although other MS processes do influence
the outcome of the experiment.

of superconducting nanocircuits; but the nonadiabatic phase may be measurable
with current techniques. Our results may provide useful information for the
implementation of geometric quantum computation.

  Park, August 2002",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.dis-nn cs.IR nlin.AO q-bio.NC",,"  I review and expand the model of quantum associative memory that I have
recently proposed. In this model binary patterns of n bits are stored in the
quantum superposition of the appropriate subset of the computational basis of n
qbits. Information can be retrieved by performing an input-dependent rotation
of the memory quantum state within this subset and measuring the resulting
state. The amplitudes of this rotated memory state are peaked on those stored
patterns which are closest in Hamming distance to the input, resulting in a
high probability of measuring a memory pattern very similar to it. The accuracy
of pattern recall can be tuned by adjusting a parameter playing the role of an
effective temperature. This model solves the well-known capacity shortage
problem of classical associative memories, providing an exponential improvement
in capacity. The price to pay is the probabilistic nature of information
retrieval, a feature that, however, this model shares with our own brain.

  Han, Y. S. Kim and A. Sergienko, NASA Conference Publication",,,"quant-ph",,"  We propose three schemes to engineer 2^M and M+1 circular states for the
motion of the center of mass of a trapped ion, $M$ being the number of laser
pulses. Since the ion is subjected to several laser pulses, we analyze the
necessary duration of each one for generating the circular states, and from
these, the Fock states and superposition of two-Fock states. We also calculate
the probability for obtaining the required states.
