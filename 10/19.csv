a point estimate of the source location by finding the maximum of this

on to central supermassive black holes energizing AGNs. We compute the outflow
and the blowout effects driven by the AGNs and the resulting, steep

coupled to the surrounding ICM at fractional levels around 5 10^{-2}. We link

engender resonance crossings and dramatic excitation of orbital eccentricities.
We provide quantitative criteria for the viability of this mechanism. For the
orbits of two bodies to diverge, a ring of viscous material must be shepherded
between them. As the ring diffuses in radius by virtue of its intrinsic
viscosity, the two planets are wedged further apart. The ring mass must be
smaller than the planetary masses so that the crossing of an individual
resonance lasts longer than the resonant libration period. At the same time,
the crossing cannot be of such long duration that the disk's direct influence
on the bodies' eccentricities interferes with the resonant interaction between
the two planets. This last criterion is robustly satisfied because resonant
widths are typically tiny fractions of the orbital radius. We evaluate our
criteria not only for giant planets within gaseous protoplanetary disks, but
also for shepherd moons that bracket narrow planetary rings in the solar
system. A shepherded ring of gas orbiting at a distance of 1 AU from a
solar-type star and having a surface density of less than 500 g/cm^2, a
dimensionless alpha viscosity of 0.1, and a height-to-radius aspect ratio of
0.05 can drive two Jovian-mass planets through the 2:1 and higher-order
resonances so that their eccentricities amplify to values of several tenths.
Because of the requirement that the disk mass in the vicinity of the planets be
smaller than the planet masses, divergent resonance crossings may figure
significantly into the orbital evolution of planets during the later stages of
disk evolution, including the debris disk phase.

time in the low/hard state, making it an ideal candidate for modeling the
assumedly low accretion phase. The radio emission correlates very tightly with
the X-rays over more than two orders of magnitude in X-ray flux density,
suggesting that the jet plasma also plays a role at higher frequencies. We
compare the predictions of our jet model, with and without acceleration, to
thirteen broadband simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous spectra over this
changing flux history. In addition, we consider a simple standard thin disk
which transitions to an optically thin accretion flow, in order to account for
the assumedly thermal optical data seen in some observations. A solution
without acceleration cannot describe the data without unrealistic energy
requirements. But because of the low disk luminosity, and possibly the assumed
disk geometry, acceleration in the jet is limited only by synchrotron cooling
and can extend easily into the X-rays. We present a model which can account for
all the broadband spectra included here, by changing only two parameters in the
jet model: the input power and the location of the first acceleration zone.
However, the model is most sensitive to changes in the jet power, the varying
of which can also account for the slope of the observed radio/X-ray correlation
analytically. At the highest low/hard state luminosities, the synchrotron
self-Compton emission from the jet could be detectable with missions such as
{\em GLAST}, providing a way to test the extent of the synchrotron
contribution. We conclude that jet synchrotron is a possible way to explain the
broadband features and this correlation, and discuss ways of incorporating this
component into the ``standard'' corona picture.

each involving the 4 migratory giant planets and 400 test particles distributed
throughout trans-Neptunian space, to measure efficiencies of capture as
functions of migration speed. Snapshots of the spatial distribution of resonant
KBOs reveal that Twotinos cluster +/- 75 degrees away from Neptune's longitude,
while Plutinos cluster +/- 90 degrees away. Longitudinal clustering persists
even for surveys that are not volume-limited in their ability to detect
resonant KBOs. Remarkably, between -90 degrees and -60 degrees of Neptune's
longitude, we find the sky density of Twotinos to nearly equal that of
Plutinos, despite the greater average distance of Twotinos. We couple our
findings to observations to crudely estimate that the intrinsic Twotino
population is within a factor of 3 of the Plutino population. Most strikingly,
the migration model predicts that more Twotinos may lie at longitudes behind
that of Neptune than ahead of it. The magnitude of the asymmetry amplifies
dramatically with faster rates of migration and can be as large as 300%. A
differential measurement of the sky density of 2:1 resonant objects behind of

history of that planet.

agreement with the semiclassical predictions for rectangular Andreev billiards
and therefore for a large number of open channels it is sufficient to
investigate the Bohr-Sommerfeld approximation of the density of states. We
present exact calculations of the classical path length distribution $P(s)$
which is a non-differentiable function of $s$, but whose integral is a smooth
function with logarithmically dependent asymptotic behavior. Consequently, the
density of states of rectangular Andreev billiards has two contributions on the
scale of the Thouless energy: one which is well-known and it is proportional to
the energy, and the other which shows a logarithmic energy dependence. It is
shown that the prefactors of both contributions depend on the geometry of the
billiards but they have universal limiting values when the width of the
superconductor tends to zero.

For the particular case of a communication channel between two identical linear
arrays of $n \gg 1$ equally-spaced transmitters/receivers (receiver spacing a),
we show that the average capacity $<C> \propto n$ and obtain explicit analytic
expressions for $<C>/n$ in the limit of $n \to \infty$ and $k \ell \to \infty$,
where $k= 2\pi/ \lambda$, $\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $\ell$ is the mean

handedness as structure. Above the crossover, however, the linewidth saturates
and the defect mode can be excited only by the oppositely polarized wave,
resulting in a peak in reflection instead of transmission.

potentials and estimate the scattering length and the collisional loss rate as
a function of magnetic field. The estimates are based on molecular potentials
between 3P2 alkaline-earth atoms obtained from ab initio atomic and molecular
structure calculations. The scattering lengths show resonance behavior due to
the appearance of a molecular bound state in a purely long-range interaction
potential and are positive for magnetic fields below 50 mT. A loss-rate model
shows that losses should be smallest near zero magnetic field and for fields
slightly larger than the resonance field, where the scattering length is also
positive.

information applications, and therefore the experimental generation of
separated yet entangled systems is of paramount importance. Experimental
demonstrations of inseparability with light are not uncommon, but such
demonstrations in physically well-separated massive systems, such as distinct
gases of atoms, are new and present significant challenges and opportunities.
Rigorous theoretical criteria are needed for demonstrating that given data are
sufficient to confirm entanglement. Such criteria for experimental data have
been derived for the case of continuous-variable systems obeying the
Heisenberg-Weyl (position- momentum) commutator. To address the question of
experimental verification more generally, we develop a sufficiency criterion
for arbitrary states of two arbitrary systems. When applied to the recent study
by Julsgaard, Kozhekin, and Polzik [Nature 413, 400 - 403 (2001)] of spin-state
entanglement of two separate, macroscopic samples of atoms, our new criterion
confirms the presence of spin entanglement.

only one of the two resulting quasi-modes enters in the interaction term. The
formalism developed is then applied to calculate various generation
probabilities analytically. We show that entanglement, starting from an initial
field and an atom in one defined state may be obtained in a single step. We
also show that entanglement may be built up in the case of an empty cavity and
excited atoms whose final states are detected, as well as in the case when the
final states of the initially excited atoms are not detected.

interpretation for the distillation of entanglement and the distinguishability
of orthogonal quantum states in terms of information is given, respectively. By
constraining our discussion on a special protocol we give a necessary and
sufficient condition for the local distinguishability of the orthogonal pure
states, and gain the maximal yield of the distillable entanglement. It is shown
that the information entropy, the locally distinguishability of quantum states
and the distillation of entanglement are closely related.
