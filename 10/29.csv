the degeneracy by the time of nucleosynthesis becomes smaller than the initial

temperature gradients and temperature transients. This sensitivity arises from
thermally dependent refractive indices, lens spacings, and lens dimensions. We
have therefore undertaken a detailed thermal analysis of Binospec, a wide-field
optical spectrograph under development for the converted MMT. Our goals are to
predict the temperature gradients that will be present in the Binospec optics
and structure under realistic operating conditions and to determine how design
choices affect these gradients. We begin our analysis by deriving thermal time
constants for instrument subassemblies. We then generate a low-resolution
finite difference model of the entire instrument and high-resolution models of
sensitive subassemblies. This approach to thermal analysis is applicable to a
variety of other instruments. We use measurements of the ambient temperature in
the converted MMT's dome to model Binospec's thermal environment. During
moderate conditions we find that the Binospec lens groups develop 0.14 C axial
and radial temperature gradients and that lens groups of different mass develop
0.5 C temperature differences; these numbers are doubled for the extreme
conditions. Internal heat sources do not significantly affect these results;
heat flow from the environment dominates. The instrument must be periodically
opened to insert new aperture masks, but we find that the resulting temperature
gradients and thermal stresses in the optics are small. Image shifts at the
detector caused by thermal deflections of the Binospec optical bench structure
are approx 0.1 pixel/hr. We conclude that the proposed Binospec design has
acceptable thermal properties, and briefly discuss design changes to further
reduce temperature gradients.

the Nobeyama Millimeter Array. The molecular gas shows four components: a main
disk, spiral arms, a nuclear disk, and a nuclear core. The main disk extends
beyond our spatial coverage. The spiral arms are superimposed on the main disk.
The nuclear disk with about 600 pc radius has an intense concentration of
molecular gas. Its appearance on PV diagrams is indicative of oval motions of
the gas, rather than circular. The nuclear core is more compact than our
resolution. Though it is unresolved, the nuclear core shows a very high
velocity about 200 km/s even at the radius of about 100 pc on the PV diagram.
We propose a model that NGC 3079 contains a weak bar. This model explains the
observed features: the main disk and spiral arms result from gaseous x1-orbits
and associated crowding respectively. The nuclear disk arises from gaseous
x2-orbits. From the appearance of the spiral arms on the PV diagram, the
pattern speed of the bar is estimated to be 55+-10 km/s/kpc. The high velocity
of the nuclear core cannot be explained by our model for a bar. Thus we
attribute it to a central massive core with a dynamical mass of 10^9 Msun
within the central 100 pc. This mass is three orders of magnitude more massive
than that of a central black hole in this galaxy.

Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). A rich and complex neutral hydrogen (HI)
structure containing shells, bubbles and filaments is revealed. On the larger
scale, the HI of the Bridge is organised into two velocity components. This
bimodality, which appears to originate in the SMC, converges to a single
velocity component within the observed region. A census of shell-like
structures suggests a shell population with characteristics similar to that of
the SMC. The mean kinematic age of the shells is ~6 Myr, in agreement with the
SMC shell population, but not with ages of OB clusters populating the
Magellanic Bridge, which are approximately an factor of three older. In
general, the projected spatial correlation of Bridge HI shells with OB
associations is poor and as such, there does not appear to be a convincing
relationship between the positions of OB associations and that of expanding
spherical HI structures. This survey has found only one HI shell that has an
identifiable association with a known Ha shell. The origin of the expanding
structures is therefore generally still uncertain, although current theories
regarding their formation include gravitational and pressure instabilities, HVC
collisions and ram pressure effects.

two-speed Riemann solver that just require the knowledge of the two local fast
magnetosonic velocities. Moreover, the onset of spurious magnetic monopoles,
which is a typical problem for multi-dimensional MHD upwind codes, is prevented
by properly taking into account the solenoidal constraint and the specific
antisymmetric nature of the induction equation. Finally, the extension to
generalized orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems is included, thus the

is found that in order to match the observations, the shape of the ultraviolet

WDs accreting CO-rich matter. We find that rotation induces the cooling of the
accreting star so that the delivered gravitational energy causes a greater
expansion with respect to the standard non-rotating case. The increase in the
surface radius produces a decrease in the surface value of the critical angular
velocity and, therefore, the accreting WD becomes gravitationally unbound
(Roche instability). This occurrence is due to an increase in the total angular
momentum of the accreting WD and depends critically on the amount of specific
angular momentum deposited by the accreted matter. If the specific angular
momentum of the accreted matter is equal to that of the outer layers of the
accreting structure, the Roche instability occurs well before the accreting WD
can attain the physical conditions for C-burning. If the values of both initial
angular velocity and accretion rate are small, we find that the accreting WD
undergoes a secular instability when its total mass approaches 1.4 Msun. At
this stage, the ratio between the rotational and the gravitational binding
energy of the WD becomes of the order of 0.1, so that the star must deform by
adopting an elliptical shape. In this case, since the angular velocity of the
WD is as large as 1 rad/s, the anisotropic mass distribution induces the loss
of rotational energy and angular momentum via GWR. We find that, independent of
the braking efficiency, the WD contracts and achieves the physical conditions
suitable for explosive C-burning at the center so that a type Ia supernova
event is produced.

tunneling of a Laughlin quasiparticle between the inner and outer edge of the
ring changes the effective Aharonov Bohm flux experienced by quasiparticles
going around the ring, leading to a change in the conductance across the ring.
A small current in the middle contact therefore gives rise to fluctuations in
the current flowing across the ring which resemble random telegraph noise. We
analyze this noise using the chiral Luttinger liquid model. At low frequencies
the telegraph noise varies inversely with the quasiparticle tunneling current,
and can be much larger than the shot noise. We propose that combining the
Aharonov Bohm effect with a noise measurement provides a direct method for
observing fractional statistics.

condensation energy density to be measured from the heat capacity data is

from GZ's influence functional $e^{- (i S_R + S_I)}$. This allows us to shed
light on GZ's claim that $S_R$ is irrelevant for decoherence: $S_R$ generates
as many important self energy diagrams as $S_I$; GZ's neglect of $S_R$ is
permissible only at high temperatures ($T > \hbar / \tau_{el}$).

Unlike conventional methods for fitting hidden Markov models (HMMs) to data,
our algorithm makes no assumptions about the process's causal architecture (the
number of hidden states and their transition structure), but rather infers it
from the data. It starts with assumptions of minimal structure and introduces
complexity only when the data demand it. Moreover, the causal states it infers
have important predictive optimality properties that conventional HMM states
lack. We introduce the algorithm, review the theory behind it, prove its
asymptotic reliability, use large deviation theory to estimate its rate of
convergence, and compare it to other algorithms which also construct HMMs from

selected numerical results from an implementation.

analyzed, it is observed that most of them are very similar, using a reduced
number of attacking techniques. It is generally agreed that classification can
help designers and programmers to better understand attacks and build more
secure applications. As an effort in this direction, a new taxonomy of web
attacks is proposed in this paper, with the objective of obtaining a
practically useful reference framework for security applications. The use of
the taxonomy is illustrated by means of multiplatform real world web attack
examples. Along with this taxonomy, important features of each attack category
are discussed. A suitable semantic-dependent web attack encoding scheme is
defined that uses different-length vectors. Possible applications are
described, which might benefit from this taxonomy and encoding scheme, such as
intrusion detection systems and application firewalls.

made of a simple model in which we introduce temperature- dependent constituent
quark masses calculated in a mean-field approximation and a
temperature-dependent confining interaction whose form is motivated by recent
studies made using lattice simulations of QCD with dynamical quarks. We also
introduce temperature-dependent coupling constants in our generalized NJL

where they are applied. This phenomenon is especially relevant for the massive
fields in curved space, because the decoupling effects may be responsible for
important cosmological applications like the graceful exit from the inflation
and low-energy quantum dynamics of the cosmological constant. We investigate,
using both covariant and non-covariant methods of calculations and
mass-dependent renormalization scheme, the vacuum quantum effects of a massive
scalar field in curved space-time. In the higher derivative sector we arrive at
the explicit form of decoupling and obtain the beta-functions in both UV and IR
regimes as the limits of general expressions. For the cosmological and Newton
constants the corresponding beta-functions are not accessible in the
perturbative regime and in particular the form of decoupling remains unclear.

particular, if all the components in the universe (i.e., radiation, baryon,
cold dark matter, and so on) are generated from the decay product of \phi, the
dominant source of the cosmic density perturbations can be the primordial
fluctuation of \phi, not the fluctuation of the inflaton field. In this case,
the constraints on the inflation models can be drastically relaxed. In other
case, the baryon or the CDM may not be from the decay product of \phi and
correlated mixture of the adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations can be
generated. If so, the CMB angular power spectrum may not be the same as the

numerically in lattice QCD with pion masses which are much larger than its

baryons, which is invariant under chiral symmetry when the light quark masses
go to zero and heavy quark symmetry when the heavy quark masses go to infinity.
A phenomenological functional form with three parameters, which has the correct
behavior in the chiral limit and appropriate behavior when the pion mass is
large, is proposed to extrapolate the lattice data. It is found that the
extrapolation deviates noticably from the naive linear extrapolation when the
pion mass is smaller than about 500MeV. The mass differences between Sigma_b

\`{a} la Kaluza-Klein. In higher dimensional gravitational theories, one
usually considers the extra dimensions to be ``frozen'' in time. However, the
internal manifold is actually a dynamic entity. For example, its metric can
change even if one expects its topological properties to be invariant. It is
conceivable then, that at an earlier epoch the internal manifold made a
geometric transition from say a maximally symmetric metric space to a less
symmetric one. We know in a Kaluza-Klein reduction scheme, the massless gauge
bosons are associated with the Killing vectors of the internal manifold. After
the transition of the internal manifold, the gauge bosons associated with the
broken Killing isometries will pick up a mass thereby breaking the gauge
invariance partially. In this paper, I explore this idea, work out the mass of
broken gauge bosons for some simple examples, and also point out how a
mechanism similar to that of Higgs may be at work.

turbulent flows, using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the FENE-P model
of viscoelastic flows. It had been amply demonstrated that these model
equations reproduce the phenomenon, but the results of DNS were not analyzed so
far with the goal of interpreting the phenomenon. In order to construct a
useful framework for the understanding of drag reduction we initiate in this
paper an investigation of the most important modes that are sustained in the
viscoelastic and Newtonian turbulent flows respectively. The modes are obtained
empirically using the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition, allowing us to compare the
most energetic modes in the viscoelastic and Newtonian flows. The main finding
of the present study is that the spatial profile of the most energetic modes is
hardly changed between the two flows. What changes is the energy associated
with these modes, and their relative ordering in the decreasing order from the
most energetic to the least. Modes that are highly excited in one flow can be
strongly suppressed in the other, and vice versa. This dramatic energy
redistribution is an important clue to the mechanism of drag reduction as is
proposed in this paper. In particular there is an enhancement of the energy
containing modes in the viscoelastic flow compared to the Newtonian one; drag
reduction is seen in the energy containing modes rather than the dissipative
modes as proposed in some previous theories.

pitch of sounds; yet our understanding of the mechanisms of pitch perception
remains incomplete. Physical models of pitch perception try to explain from
elementary principles why certain physical characteristics of the stimulus lead
to particular pitch sensations. There are two broad categories of
pitch-perception models: place or spectral models consider that pitch is mainly
related to the Fourier spectrum of the stimulus, whereas for periodicity or
temporal models its characteristics in the time domain are more important.
Current models from either class are usually computationally intensive,
implementing a series of steps more or less supported by auditory physiology.
However, the brain has to analyse and react in real time to an enormous amount
of information from the ear and other senses. How is all this information
efficiently represented and processed in the nervous system? A proposal of
nonlinear and complex systems research is that dynamical attractors may form
the basis of neural information processing. Because the auditory system is a
complex and highly nonlinear dynamical system it is natural to suppose that
dynamical attractors may carry perceptual and functional meaning. Here we show
that this idea, scarcely developed in current pitch models, can be successfully
applied to pitch perception.

holomorphism, causality and the classical principle of stationary phase. We
also make a preliminary study of the effect of noise on information transfer
time, and find that noise tends to increase transfer times. Noise and
information signals are both essentially acausal, such that analytic
continuation (i.e. prediction) is impossible, which also implies that their
frequency spectra cannot be holomorphic. This leads to the paradox of a
non-holomorphic information-bearing light signal, yet whose underlying Maxwell
equations governing the propagation of the EM wave describe a holomorphic
function in spacetime. We find that application of stationary phase and entropy
arguments circumvents this difficulty, with stationary phase only suggesting
the most likely transfer times of an information signal in the presence of
noise. Faster transit times are not excluded, but are highly improbable.
Stationary phase solutions, by definition, do not include signal forerunners,
whose detection in the presence of noise is also unreliable. Hence a finite
information capacity ensues, as expected from Shannon's law, and information
cannot be transferred faster than c. We also find that the method of stationary
phase implies complex transfer times. However, by considering spacetime to be
isomorphic with the complex temporal plane, we find that an imaginary time is
equivalent to a real distance, and can be interpreted as the uncertainty in the
spatial position of the information pulse. Finally, we apply our theory to a
photonic band gap crystal, and find that information transfer speed and
tunneling is always subluminal.

stroboscopic maps, and in the regular (non chaotic) spatial configurations of
the filaments. Our analysis shows that the tridimensional conformations of long
filaments may depend critically on the Young's modulus frequence in case of
resonance with other natural frequencies of the filament. As expected, far from
resonance the shape of the solutions remain very close to that of the
homogeneous case. In the case of biomolecules, it is well known that various
other elements, besides sequence-dependent effects, combine to determine their
conformation, like self-contact, salt concentration, thermal fluctuations,
anisotropy and interaction with proteins. Our results show that
sequence-dependent effects alone may have a significant influence on the shape
of these molecules, including DNA. This could, therefore, be a possible
mechanical function of the ``junk'' sequences.
