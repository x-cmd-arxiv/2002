inaugurate the field of {\it gravitational-wave astronomy}: using
gravitational-waves as a means of listening to highly relativistic dynamical
processes in astrophysics. This review discusses the promise of this field,
outlining why gravitational waves are worth pursuing, and what they are
uniquely suited to teach us about astrophysical phenomena. We review the

luminosity function, velocity dispersion and density profile were typically
{\it assumed} in order to constrain cosmological parameters. It is indeed
remarkable that observational cosmology has reached the point where we can
consider using cosmology to constrain astrophysics, rather than vice versa. We
use two different observables to obtain our constraints (total optical depth
and angular distributions of lensing events). In spite of the relatively poor
statistics and the uncertain identification of lenses in the survey, we obtain
interesting constraints on the velocity dispersion and density profiles of
elliptical galaxies. For example, assuming the SIS density profile and
marginalizing over other relevant parameters, we find 168 km/s < sigma_* < 200
km/s (68% CL), and 158 km/s < sigma_* < 220 km/s (95% CL). Furthermore, if we
instead assume a generalized NFW density profile and marginalize over other
parameters, the slope of the profile is constrained to be 1.50 < beta < 2.00
(95% CL). We also constrain the concentration parameter as a function of the
density profile slope in these models. These results are essentially
independent of the exact knowledge of cosmology. We briefly discuss the
possible impact on these constraints of allowing the galaxy luminosity function
to evolve with redshift, and also possible useful future directions for
exploration.

functions (CLFs) of early- and late-type galaxies. These functions give the
average number of galaxies with luminosity L that reside in a halo of mass M,

that of dark matter haloes. We find that the average mass-to-light ratios of
dark matter haloes have a minimum of about 100 Msun/Lsun around a halo mass of
about 3x10^{11} Msun. In addition, haloes with M < 10^{10} Msun are virtually
devoid of galaxies, while clusters have b_J band mass-to-light ratios in the
range 500-1000 Msun/Lsun. Finally, the fact that early-type galaxies are more
strongly clustered than late-type galaxies requires that the fraction of
late-type galaxies is a strongly declining function of halo mass. We also
compute two-point correlation functions as function of both luminosity and
galaxy type, and find a weak (strong) luminosity dependence for the late
(early) type galaxies. Finally we compare our CLFs with predictions from
several semi-analytical models for galaxy formation. As long as these models
accurately fit the 2dFGRS luminosity function the agreement with our
predictions is remarkably good. This indicates that we have recovered a
statistical description of how galaxies populate dark matter haloes which fits
nicely within the standard framework for galaxy formation.

X-ray absorption, using inputs from high-resolution hydro-dynamical simulations
and analytical prescriptions. We show that the number of OVII absorbers per
unit redshift with column density larger than $10^{13.5}$ cm$^{-2}$ -
corresponding to an equivalent width of $\sim$ 1 km/s - which will be possibly
detectable by {\it XEUS}, is $\magcir 30$ per unit redshift. {\it
Constellation-X} will detect $\sim 6$ OVII absorptions per unit redshift with
an equivalent width of 10 km/s. Our results show that, in a $\Lambda$CDM
Universe, the characteristic size of these absorbers at $z\sim 0.1$ is $\sim 1$

coincident absorption lines in the spectra of background AGN pairs. We estimate
that at least 20 AGN pairs at separation $\mincir 20$ arcmin are needed to
detect this filamentary structure at a 3$\sigma$ level. Assuming observations
of distant sources using {\it XEUS} for exposure times of 500 ksec, we find
that the minimum source flux to probe the filamentary structure is $\sim

most pairs of these extragalactic X-ray bright sources have already been
identified in the {\it ROSAT} All-Sky Survey. Re-observation of these objects
by future missions could be a powerful way to search for baryons in the low

additional contributions to the more familiar dark matter. Primordial
nucleosynthesis provides a window on the very early evolution of the universe
and constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) can bound the parameters of
models for dark matter/energy at redshifts of order ten billion. The spectrum
of temperature fluctuations imprinted on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
radiation opens a completely different window on the universe at epochs from
redshifts of order ten thousand to nearly the present. The CMB anisotropy
spectrum provides constraints on new physics which are independent of, and
complementary to those from BBN. Here we consider three classes of models for
the dark matter/energy: extra particles which were relativistic during the
early evolution of the universe (X); Quintessence models involving a
minimally-coupled scalar field (Q); models with a non-minimally coupled scalar
field which modify the strength of gravity during the early evolution of the
universe (G). We constrain the parameters of these models using data from BBN
and the CMB and identify the allowed regions in their parameter spaces
consistent with the more demanding joint BBN and CMB constraints. For X and Q
such consistency is relatively easy to find; it is more difficult for the G
models with an inverse power law potential for the scalar field.

the Leading Arm, a forward counterpart to the Magellanic Stream. These

origin in the Galactic tidal field, in agreement with recent 2MASS and DENIS
results for the stellar population. The diffuse gas which surrounds the LMC,

features, but loosening by the ram pressure of tenuous Galactic halo gas
against the outer parts of the LMC cannot be discounted. High-velocity clouds,
which lie between the Galaxy and the LMC in velocity and which appear in the UV
spectra of some LMC stars, are found to be associated with the LMC if their

useful way to understand key points determining the shape of the non-Gaussian
tails of the dark matter one-point probability distribution function(PDF). In
particular, using the scale-free models with power-law profile of dark halos,
we derive a simple analytic expression for the one-point PDF. It is found that
the shape of the PDF changes at the characteristic value of $\delta_*$ which is
defined by the smoothed density of a halo with the characteristic mass $M_*$ at
the epoch. In cold dark matter models with top-hat smoothing filters, the
characteristic smoothed density at present time typically takes the value
$\delta_*\gg 1$ for a small smoothing scale $\rth\sim 1$Mpc$/h$ and conversely
$\delta_*\ll 1$ for a large smoothing scale $\rth > 10$Mpc$/h$. On the range
$\delta/\delta_*<1$, the shape of the PDF is almost solely determined by the
outer slope of halos and scales as a power-law. The resultant non-Gaussian
tails of PDF then resemble the log-normal PDFs in that range and show a good
agreement with N-body simulations, which can be ascribed to the universality of
the outer slope of the halo profile. In contrast, tails of one-point PDF in the
range $\delta/\delta_*>1$ basically follow the steep exponential tails of the
halo mass function, which exhibit a strong sensitivity to both the outer slope
of the halo profile and the initial power spectrum. Based on these results, the

bind these sample objects to the Galaxy, their rest-frame velocities must be
lower than their escape velocities at their estimated distances. This
constraint enables us to show that the mass estimate of the Galaxy is largely
affected by several high-velocity objects (Leo I, Pal 3, Draco, and a few FHB
stars), not by a single object alone (such as Leo I), as has often been the
case in past analyses. We also find that a gravitational potential that gives
rise to a declining rotation curve is insufficient to bind many of our sample
objects to the Galaxy; a possible lower limit on the mass of the Galaxy is
about 2.2 x 10^12 Msolar. To be more quantitative, we adopt a Bayesian
likelihood approach to reproduce the observed distribution of the current
positions and motions of the sample, in a prescribed Galactic potential that
yields a flat rotation curve. This method enables a search for the most likely
total mass of the Galaxy, without undue influence in the final result arising
from the presence or absence of Leo I, provided that both radial velocities and
proper motions are used. The most likely total mass derived from this method is
2.5^+0.5_-1.0 x 10^12 Msolar (including Leo I), and 1.8^+0.4_-0.7 x 10^12

22.1 (AB) constructed from BVRi'z'JHKs multicolor data of a 114 arcmin2 area in

ellipticals (OEs) and young, dusty starbursts (DSs) to the multicolor data, we
classify EROs into these two classes and estimate their redshifts. We find that
58% of the EROs in our sample belong to the OE class and that 24% of the OEs
are fit by a spectrum having a disk component with the B-band bulge-to-total
luminosity ratio of <= 0.9. We compare the observed surface density of OEs with
predictions from passive evolution models. We then derive rest-frame B-band
luminosity functions (LFs) of OEs in our sample at z=1-1.5 and 1.5-2.5. We find
that the LF at z=1-1.5 roughly agrees with the LF of local ellipticals if a
dimming of 1.3 mag from z=1.25 to the present epoch is assumed. On the other
hand, the amplitude of the LF at z=1.5-2.5 is found to be lower than that of
the local LF by a factor of ~ 3 over the whole range of magnitude observed.
Taking account of a strong decrease in the number density of morphologically
classified early-type galaxies at z >~ 1.5 found by several authors, we
conclude that the majority of ellipticals seen at present have not established
either a red color or a smooth 1/4-law profile before z ~ 1.5$. (abridged)

features consist of a narrow 5.0 keV absorption line with modulation near its
second and third harmonics (at 11.2 keV and 17.5 keV respectively). The line
features are transient and are detected in the harder part of the precursor.
The 5.0 keV feature is strong, with an equivalent width of ~ 500 eV and a
narrow width of less than 0.4 keV. Interpreting the features as electron
cyclotron lines in the context of accretion models leads to a large mass-radius
ratio (M/R > 0.3 M_sun/km) that is inconsistent with neutron stars or that
requires a low (5-7)x10^{11} G magnetic field that is unlikely for SGRs. The
line widths are also narrow compared with those of electron cyclotron
resonances observed so far in X-ray pulsars. In the magnetar picture, the
features are plausibly explained as ion cyclotron resonances in an ultra-strong
magnetic field that have recently been predicted from magnetar candidates. In
this view, the 5.0 keV feature is consistent with a proton cyclotron
fundamental whose energy and width are close to model predictions. The line
energy would correspond to a surface magnetic field of 1.0x10^{15} G for SGR
1806-20, in good agreement with that inferred from the spin-down measure in the

near the core. Furthermore, as shown by Talon & Charbonnel (1998) and

rotation-induced mixing in stars braked via magnetic torquing can explain the
blue side of the Li dip, as well as the low Li abundances observed in subgiants

non-linear surface terms which are then treated at a one-loop level by
calculating the mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann solution and then the fluctuations
about this solution. We carefully analyze the renormalization of the theory and
apply it to a triple layer model for a thin film with Stern layer of thickness
$h$. For this model we give expressions for the surface charge $\sigma(L)$ and
the disjoining pressure $P_d(L)$ and show their dependence on the parameters.
The influence of image charges naturally arise in the formalism and we show
that predictions depend strongly on $h$ because of their effects. In
particular, we show that the surface charge vanishes as the film thickness $L
\to 0$. The fluctuation terms about this class of theories exhibit a
Casimir-like attraction across the film and although this attraction is well
known to be negligible compared with the mean-field component for thick films
in the presence of electrolyte, in the model studied here these fluctuations
also affect the surface charge regulation leading to a fluctuation component in
the disjoining pressure which has the same behavior as the mean-field component
even for large film thickness.

constructed not from first-principles calculations, but from the structural
energetics of an atomistic shell model for BaTiO3 of Tinte et al. This allows
the elimination of certain uncontrolled approximations that arise in the
comparison of first-principles effective Hamiltonian results with experimental
values and the quantification of errors associated with the selection of the
effective Hamiltonian subspace and subsequent projection. The discrepancies in
transition temperatures computed in classical simulations for this effective
Hamiltonian and for the atomistic shell model are shown to be associated
primarily with a poor description of the thermal expansion in the former case.
This leads to specific proposals for refinements to the first-principles
effective Hamiltonian method. Our results suggest that there are at least two
significant sources of error in the effective-Hamiltonian treatment of BaTiO3
in the literature, i.e., the improper treatment of thermal expansion, and the
errors inherent in the first-principles approach itself.

Fermi leads. We calculate current and shot noise for spin-polarized currents

\textit{local} Rashba spin-orbit (s-o) interaction in the incoming leads. We
find \textit{continuous} bunching and antibunching behaviors for the
\textit{entangled} pairs -- triplet and singlet -- as a function of the Rashba
rotation angle. In addition, we find that unentangled triplets and the
entangled one exhibit distinct shot noise. Shot noise for spin-polarized
currents shows sizable oscillations as a function of the Rashba phase. This
happens only for electrons injected perpendicular to the Rashba rotation axis;
spin-polarized carriers along the Rashba axis are noiseless. We find an
additional spin rotation for electrons with energies near the crossing of the
bands where s-o induced interband coupling is relevant. This gives rise to an
additional modulation of the noise for both electron pairs and spin-polarized
currents. Finally, we briefly discuss shot noise for a double dot near the

degeneracies of a simple spin Hamiltonian used to model spin relaxation in
alkali-metal vapors. We consider this spin Hamiltonian in detail and use this
example to outline a general approach to finding symmetries when eigenvalues
and eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are known. We extract all nontrivial
symmetries responsible for the degeneracy and show that the symmetry group of
the Hamiltonian is SU(2). The symmetry operators have a simple meaning which
becomes transparent in the limit of large spin. As an additional example we
apply the method to the Hydrogen atom.

magnetic field on the interference contribution to the conductance of

the polarization of impurity spins reduces the rate of electron phase
relaxation, thus enhancing the weak localization correction to conductivity.
Magnetic field also suppresses thermal fluctuations of magnetic impurities,
leading to a recovery of the conductance fluctuations. This recovery occurs
regardless the strength of the spin-orbit interaction. We calculate the
magnitudes of the weak localization correction and of the mesoscopic
conductance fluctuations at an arbitrary level of the spin polarization induced
by a magnetic field. Our analytical results for the ``$h/e$'' Aharonov-Bohm
conductance oscillations in metal rings can be used to extract spin and
gyromagnetic factor of magnetic impurities from existing experimental data.

leading exchange markets (US dollar against the Deutsmark and against the Yen),
in the major world stock markets, in the U.S. and Japanese bond market and in
the gold market, by introducing the concept of ``coarse-grained drawdowns,''
which allows for a certain degree of fuzziness in the definition of cumulative
losses and improves on the statistics of our previous results on the existence
of ``outliers'' or ``kings.'' Then, for each identified outlier, we check
whether log-periodic power law signatures (LPPS) are present and take the
existence of LPPS as the qualifying signature for an endogenous crash: this is
because a drawdown outlier is seen as the end of a speculative unsustainable
accelerating bubble generated endogenously. In the absence of LPPS, we are able
to identify what seems to have been the relevant historical event, i.e., a new
piece of information of such magnitude and impact that it is seems reasonable
to attribute the crash to it, in agreement with the standard view of the
efficient market hypothesis. Such drawdown outliers are classified as having an
exogenous origin. Globally over all the markets analyzed, we identify 49
outliers, of which 25 are classified as endogenous, 22 as exogeneous and 2 as
associated with the Japanese anti-bubble. Restricting to the world market
indices, we find 31 outliers, of which 19 are endogenous, 10 are exogenous and
2 are associated with the Japanese anti-bubble. The combination of the two
proposed detection techniques, one for drawdown outliers and the second for
LPPS, provides a novel and systematic taxonomy of crashes further subtantiating
the importance of LPPS.

show that the spin--orbit splitting of the valence band leads to the
surface--induced spin--orbit splitting of the excited conduction band states

nanocrystals. This additional magnetic moment manifests itself in a nonzero
surface contribution to the linear Zeeman splitting of all quantum size energy
levels including the ground 1S electron state. The fitting of the size
dependence of the ground state electron g factor in CdSe nanocrystals has
allowed us to determine the appropriate surface parameter of the boundary
conditions. The structure of the excited electron states is considered in the

significantly worse than the MPM, caused by a shallow bound state appearing at

formulation of noncommutative QCD. The results they obtained were used to
constrain the noncommutativity parameter in Lorentz violating noncommutative
field theories. However, their constraint depended upon an estimate of the
matrix element of the quark level operator (gamma.p - m) in a nucleon. In this
paper we calculate the matrix element of (gamma.p - m), using a variety of
confinement potential models. Our results are within an order of magnitude
agreement with the estimate made by Carlson et al. The constraints placed on
the noncommutativity parameter were very strong, and are still quite severe
even if weakened by an order of magnitude.

essentially a decomposition of $\xi$ as $\zeta \otimes L\mathbb C$, where
$\zeta$ is a finite dimensional subbundle of $\xi$ and $L\mathbb C$ is the loop
space of the complex numbers. The criterion is a reduction of the structure
group to the finite rank unitary group U(n) viewed as the subgroup of LU(n)
consisting of constant loops. Next we study the case where $\xi$ is the loop
space of an $n$ dimensional bundle $\zeta \to M$. The tangent bundle of $LM$ is
such a bundle. We then show how to twist such a bundle by elements of the
automorphism group of the pull back of $\zeta$ over $LM$ via the map $LM \to M$
that evaluates a loop at a basepoint. Given a connection on $\zeta$, we view
the associated parallel transport operator as an element of this gauge group

\sqrt{k}, and that this inequality is strict except when k is a perfect square.
For k=m^2 + \ell, \ell fixed, m large, Friedland showed that the optimal
digraph is obtained from the complete digraph on m vertices by adding one extra
vertex, and a corresponding loop, and then connecting it to the first \lfloor
\ell/2\rfloor vertices by pairs of directed edges (this is for odd \ell, for
even \ell we add one extra edge to the new vertex).
  Using a combinatorial reciprocity theorem by Gessel, and a classification by
Backelin on the digraphs on s edges having a maximal number of walks of length
two, we obtain the following result: for fixed 0< s \neq 4, k=(m+1)^2 - s, m
large, the maximal spectral radius of a digraph with k edges is obtained by the
digraph which is constructed from the complete digraph on m+1 vertices by
removing the loop at the last vertex together with \lfloor s/2 \rfloor pairs of
directed edges that connect to the last vertex (if s is even, remove an extra

this value is actually the energy of the spring plus the energy of the
atmosphere that surrounds it. On a quasi-isentropic aproximation in which the
dynamic force is approximately the same as the static force, k is not a
constant. Only by considering an ideal spring where k is constant and only on a
static regime, can we say the energy is 1/2 k xx. For any dynamic regime of
such an ideal spring, the energy of the spring is a function of its temperature
and therefore is different from 1/2 k xx. If any given mass is moving attached
to an ideal spring, the movement will eventually cease even if such movement
occurs in vacuum. The dynamic force is not the static force kx. The Second Law
of Thermodynamics is essential in order to formulate Hooke's Law.

individual qubits proves to be sufficient, with a suitable encoding of the
logical qubits, to generate universal quantum gates. Furthermore, by tuning the
