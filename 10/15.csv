the ""missing"" dwarf galaxies of the Local Group, by searching them for
populations of resolved stars. To this end we conducted two distinct tests
based on optical and near-infrared single-star photometry. The optical and the
near-infrared experiments complement one another; the optical data help us to
rule out distant populations but they are restricted to the central regions of
the gas distributions, whereas the near-infrared photometry allows us to set
limits on nearby populations spread over the typical cloud size. First, we
discuss deep optical single-star photometry of five CHVCs in the V and I
filters, obtained with the FORS instrument at the Very Large Telecope (VLT). We
find that their optical colour-magnitude diagrams are indistinguishable from
that of a population of Galactic stars, and attribute all of the resolved stars
to Galactic foreground. We present simulations which address the question of
how much of a ""normal"" dwarf-galaxy type population we might hide in the data.
A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test allows us to set very stringent limits on the absence
of a resolved stellar population in CHVCs. Second, we also culled near infrared
single-star photometry in the J, H, and K_S bands for four of the CHVCs from
the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). The infrared data do not reveal any
stellar contents in the CHVCs which resembles that of nearby dwarf galaxies
either, and are explained with Galactic foreground as well. We interpret our
null detections to indicate that the five CHVCs investigated by us do not host
an associated stellar content which is similar to that of the known dwarf
galaxies of the Local Group. These CHVCs are very likely pure hydrogen clouds
in which no star formation has taken place over cosmic time.

  'Extragalactic Globular Cluster Systems', ed. by M. Kissler-Patig",,"10.1007/10857603_40",,"astro-ph",,"  Globular cluster systems (GCSs) are vital tools for investigating the violent
star formation histories of their host galaxies. This violence could e.g. have
been triggered by galaxy interactions or mergers. The basic observational
properties of a GCS are its luminosity function and color distributions (number
of clusters per luminosity resp. color bin). A large number of observed GCSs
show bimodal color distributions, which, by comparison with evolutionary
synthesis (ES) models, can be translated into bimodality in metallicity and/or
age. An additional uncertainty comes into play when one considers extinction
within the host galaxy. These effects can be disentangled either by obtaining
spectroscopic data for the clusters or by imaging observations in at least four
passbands. This allows us then to discriminate between various formation
scenarios of GCSs, e.g. the merger scenario by Ashman & Zepf and the
multi-phase collapse model by Forbes et. al.. Young and metal-rich star cluster
populations are seen to form in interacting and merging galaxies. We analyse
multi-wavelength broad-band observations of these young cluster systems

of a 1.5 m aperture diameter telescope and an array of 21 photometers
maintained at ~100 mK that are operating in 4 frequency bands centered at 143,
217, 353 and 545 GHz. The data were taken during the Arctic night of February
7, 2002 after the instrument was launched by CNES from Esrange base (Sweden).
The entire data cover ~ 30% of the sky.This first analysis was obtained with a
small subset of the dataset using the most sensitive photometer in each CMB
band (143 and 217 GHz) and 12.6% of the sky at galactic latitudes above 30
degrees where the foreground contamination is measured to be negligible. The
large sky coverage and medium resolution (better than 15 arcminutes) provide
for the first time a high signal-to-noise ratio determination of the power
spectrum over angular scales that include both the first acoustic peak and
scales probed by COBE/DMR. With a binning of Delta(l)=7 to 25 the error bars
are dominated by sample variance for l below 200. A companion paper details the
cosmological implications.

analysis of Archeops data in combination with other CMB datasets constrains the
baryon content of the Universe, Omega(b)h^2 = 0.022 (+0.003,-0.004), compatible
with Big-Bang nucleosynthesis and with a similar accuracy. Using cosmological
priors obtainedfrom recent non-CMB data leads to yet tighter constraints on the
total density, e.g. Omega(tot)=1.00 (+0.03,-0.02) using the HST determination
of the Hubble constant. An excellent absolute calibration consistency is found
between Archeops and other CMB experiments, as well as with the previously
quoted best fit model.The spectral index n is measured to be 1.04 (+0.10,-0.12)

lines in the QSO spectra shows that the intergalactic medium contains less
neutral hydrogen than the global average within r<0.5h^-1 comoving Mpc of LBGs
and more than average at slightly larger distances 1<r<5 h^-1 comoving Mpc. The
intergalactic medium within the largest overdensities at z~3, which will

appears unlikely to be produced solely by the Lyman continuum radiation they

measured outflow velocities of ~600 km/s for a few hundred million years and
drive away nearby intergalactic gas. We present correlation functions of

Only this will show directly how galaxies affect their surroundings and provide
a rough energy scale for supernova-driven winds. Redshifts 1<z<3 are ideal for

  \gamma ~10^5 through resonant scattering. We also find that the turbulent
resonant acceleration can give enough energy to electrons to produce the
observed diffuse radio relic emission from clusters if the clusters have a pool
of electrons with \gamma ~10^3.
  This mechanism can also explain the observed hard X-ray emission from
clusters if the magnetic field in a cluster is small enough (~<
  \mu G) or the fluid turbulence spectrum is flatter than the Kolmogorov law.
The fluid turbulence could be observed with Astro-E2 in the regions where
diffuse radio emission is observed. Although non-gravitational heating before
cluster formation (preheating) steepens a relation between radio luminosity and
X-ray temperature, our predicted relation is still flatter than the observed
one.

time-dependent entropy mass and a non-negligible angular velocity in field

search for correlations in two concrete models. The correlation is found to be
particularly strong in a supersymmetric scenario due to rapid growth of entropy
perturbations in the tachyonic region separating the two inflationary stages.

chemical evolution such as CCS, the isotopes of CO and HCO+, DCO+, and N2H+.
The CO molecule is significantly depleted in L1512 and L1544, but not in

L1544 because of the significant depletion of CO molecules. N2H+ might already

emission in L1544. On the other hand, L1689B may be so young that N2H+ has not

had one of the earliest detected optical afterglows, allowing a dense optical
sampling. The lightcurve was peculiar, since bright bumps were superimposed to
the regular power-law decay observed in many other events. We show that, given
their time scale and shape, the bumps are due to the interaction of the
fireball with moderate enhancements in the ambient medium density. The
enhancements have a density contrast of order 10, modifying only slightly the
dynamics of the fireball, which therefore surfs on them rather than colliding
onto them. A relativistic reverse shock does not develop. Since the interaction
takes place when the fireball is still hyper-relativistic it is not possible to
understand if the overdensities are localized in clumps or are spherically
symmetric around the GRB progenitor. The monotonic decrease of the contrast of
successive rebrightenings suggests however the presence of clumps in an average
uniform environment. Such an interpretation, complemented by the detection of
several high velocity absorption systems in the optical spectrum, strongly
suggests that GRB 021004 exploded within the remnant of a previous explosion.

date have not led to any broad consensus about their origins, properties and
evolution, though they are often thought to have formed in one big burst of
star formation early in the history of the Universe, and to have evolved
relatively passively since then. In that picture, current theory predicts that
stellar evolution returns substantial quantities of gas to the interstellar
medium; most is ejected from the galaxy, but significant amounts of cool gas
might be retained. Past searches for that material, though, have provided
unclear results. We present results from a survey of molecular gas in a
volume-limited sample of field S0 galaxies, selected from the Nearby Galaxies
Catalog. CO emission is detected from 78 percent of the sample galaxies. We
find that the molecular gas is almost always located inside the central few
kiloparses of a lenticular galaxy, meaning that in general it is more centrally
concentrated than in spirals. We combine our data with HI observations from the
literature to determine the total masses of cool and cold gas. Curiously, we
find that, across a wide range of luminosity, the most gas rich galaxies have
about 10 percent of the total amount of gas ever returned by their stars. That
result is difficult to understand within the context of either monolithic or
hierarchical models of evolution of the interstellar medium.

decay characteristic of systems where some kinetic processes are frozen. The
$\beta$ relaxation at short times is explained in terms of the Krall-Weitz
model for the decorelation due to the elastic modes present. The $\alpha$
relaxation at long times is well described by a stretched exponential, showing
a wide spectrum of relaxation times for which the $q$ dependence is
$\tau_{\alpha} = q^{-2.2}$, lower than for diffusion. For the shortest waiting
times, a combination of two stretched exponentials is used, suggesting a
bimodal distribution. The extracted relaxation times vary with waiting time as
$\tau_{\alpha}=\tau_w^{0.66}$, slower than the simple aging case. The real
space displacements are found to be strongly non-Gaussian, correlated in space
and time. We were unable to find clear evidence that the gel aging was driven
by internal stresses. Rather, we hypothesise that in this case of weakly
interacting gels, the aging behaviour arises due to the thermal diffusion of
strands, constrained by the percolating network which ruptures discontinuously.
Although the mechanisms differ, the similarity of some of the results with the
aging of glasses is striking.

While describing satisfactorily the elastic response, the model fails to

separating two condensate bulks. It is shown that the strong barrier proves to
be transparent for the excitations at low energy $\epsilon$. Moreover, the
transmission is reduced with increasing $\epsilon$ in contrast to the standard

{\em Sum of Squares} algorithm ($SS$) for bin packing introduced and studied
experimentally in \cite{CJK99}, along with several new variants. $SS$ is
applicable to any instance of bin packing in which the bin capacity $B$ and
item sizes $s(a)$ are integral (or can be scaled to be so), and runs in time
$O(nB)$. It performs remarkably well from an average case point of view: For
any discrete distribution in which the optimal expected waste is sublinear,
$SS$ also has sublinear expected waste. For any discrete distribution where the
optimal expected waste is bounded, $SS$ has expected waste at most $O(\log n)$.
In addition, we discuss several interesting variants on $SS$, including a
randomized $O(nB\log B)$-time on-line algorithm $SS^*$, based on $SS$, whose
expected behavior is essentially optimal for all discrete distributions.
Algorithm $SS^*$ also depends on a new linear-programming-based
pseudopolynomial-time algorithm for solving the NP-hard problem of determining,
given a discrete distribution $F$, just what is the growth rate for the optimal
expected waste. This article is a greatly expanded version of the conference

discontinuous geodesics; and the superluminal propagation of light in
gravitational radiation metrics in a modified electrodynamics featuring
violations of the strong equivalence principle. While we show that ultimately
none of these constructions creates a working time machine, their study
illustrates the subtle levels at which causal self-consistency imposes itself,

homeomorphic and, from their construction, seem to be quite different, but
cannot be distinguished by Seiberg-Witten invariants. Whether these manifolds
are, or are not, actually diffeomorphic seems to be a very difficult question
to answer.
  The most interesting of these constructions is a surgery that from certain
symplectic 4-manifolds will produce nonsymplectic 4-manifolds. This is detected
by calculations of Seiberg-Witten invariants. The surgery in question can be
performed on any 4-manifold which contains as a codimension 0 submanifold a
punctured surface bundle over a punctured surface and a nontrivial loop in the
base which has trivial monodromy.
  A starting point for another class of examples in this paper is a family of
examples which show that the Parshin-Arakelov theorem for holomorphic Lefschetz
fibrations is false in the symplectic category. Such families are constructed
by means of knot surgery on elliptic surfaces. It is shown that for a fixed
homeomorphism type X (of a simply connected elliptic surface) and a fixed
integer $g \ge 3$, there are infinitely many genus g Lefschetz fibrations on
nondiffeomorphic 4-manifolds, all homeomorphic to X.

the adaptive component of evolutionary processes. On the basis of these

the biosphere, and possibly the human economy belongs to the 4th class. The
challenge to the artificial life community is to identify exactly what is
difference between these natural evolutionary systems, and existing artificial
life systems. At ALife VII, I presented a study using an artificial
evolutionary ecology called \EcoLab. Bedau's statistics captured the
qualitative behaviour of the model. \EcoLab{} exhibited behaviour from the
first 3 classes, but not class 4, which is characterised by unbounded growth in
diversity. \EcoLab{} exhibits a critical surface given by an inverse
relationship between connectivity and diversity, above which the model cannot
tarry long. Thus in order to get unbounded diversity increase, there needs to
be a corresponding connectivity reducing (or food web pruning) process. This
paper reexamines this question in light of two possible processes that reduce
ecosystem connectivity: a tendency for specialisation and increase in
biogeographic zones through continental drift.
