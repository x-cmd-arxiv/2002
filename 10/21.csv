relations of low-surface-brightness and dwarf galaxies with stellar masses in
the range 6x10^5 <M*< 3x10^10 Msun. These galaxies, as measured from SDSS and
in the Local Group, show tight correlations of internal velocity, metallicity
and surface brightness (or radius) with M*. They define a fundamental line
distinguishing them from the brighter galaxies of high surface brightness and
metallicity. The idealized model assumes spherical collapse of CDM haloes to
virial equilibrium and angular-momentum conservation. The relations for bright
galaxies are reproduced by assuming that M* is a constant fraction of the halo
mass M. The upper bound to the low-luminosity LSBs coincides with the virial
velocity of haloes in which supernova feedback could significantly suppress
star formation, V<100km/s (Dekel & Silk 1986). We argue that the energy fed to
the gas obeys E_sn \prop M* despite the radiative losses, and equate it with
the binding energy of the gas to obtain M*/M \prop V^2. This idealized model
provides surprisingly good fits to the scaling relations of low-luminosity LSBs
and dwarfs, which indicates that supernova feedback had a primary role in
determining the fundamental line. The apparent lower bound for galaxies at
V~10km/s may be due to the cooling barrier at T~10^4 K. Some fraction of the
dark haloes may show no stars due to complete gas removal either by supernova
winds from neighboring galaxies or by radiative feedback after cosmological
reionization at z_ion. Radiative feedback may also explain the distinction
between dwarf spheroidals (dE) and irregulars (dI), where the dEs of V<30km/s
form stars before z_ion and are then cleaned out of gas, while the dIs with
V>30km/s retain gas-rich discs with feedback-regulated star formation.

of vertical nodes (n) appears as a separation constant, admits a wave-action
current that is conserved except, in some cases, at corotation. Waves without
vertical nodes amplify when reflected by a barrier near corotation. Their
action is conserved. As was previously known, this amplification allows the n=0
modes to be unstable under appropriate boundary conditions. In contrast, we
find that waves with n >0 are strongly absorbed at corotation rather than
amplified; their action is not conserved. Therefore, non-axisymmetric p-modes
and g-modes with n>0 are damped and stable even in an inviscid disk. This
eliminates a promising explanation for quasi-periodic oscillations in
neutron-star and black-hole X-ray binaries.

correctly modelled, the atmosphere will appear to have a minimum opacity that

the Ly-a and HeII 1640 recombination lines in starbursts. The transition from
primordial galaxies to currently observed metallicities, is examined. For the
average properties of starbursts, the main findings are: 1) The Lyman continuum
flux increases with decreasing metallicity. For a universal Salpeter IMF from
1-100 Msun the enhancement reaches typically a factor of ~3 between solar
metallicity and Pop III objects. 2) While for metallicities Z >~ 1/50 Zsun the
amplitude of the Lyman-break depends little on Z, a reduction by a factor ~2 is
found at lower Z, due to the strong increase of the average stellar
temperature. 3) Using theoretical models and empirical constraints we discuss
the expected evolution of the hardness of He+ to H ionising photons with
metallicity and possible uncertainties. We also provide a simple estimate of
the possible impact of hot WR like stars on Q(He+)/Q(H) at very low
metallicities. 4) Calibrations for star formation rate determinations from
various recombination lines at all metallicities and for various IMFs are
derived.
  For young bursts the maximum Ly-a equivalent width is shown to increase
strongly with decreasing metallicity for the same IMF. However, for well known
reasons, the Ly-a emission predicted likely represents an upper limit.
Non-negligible HeII 1640 emission due to stellar photoionisation appears to be
limited to very low metallicities and Population III objects.(abridged

large coverage in spectral type allows us to derive a new temperature scale for
Galactic O supergiants that is lower than the one obtained by using pure H--He
models, either plane-parallel and hydrostatic or spherical with mass-loss. The
lower temperatures are thus a combined effect of line blanketing and the large
mass-loss rates. In some cases, the newly derived effective temperature is
reduced by up to 8000 K. Changes are larger for earlier stars with large
mass--loss rates. As a consequence, luminosities are modified as well, which
results in a lower number of emerging ionizing photons and reduces the mass
discrepancy. Although there are still significant differences between
spectroscopic and evolutionary masses, we do not find any obvious systematic
pattern of those differences. We derive mass--loss rates and the corresponding
wind momentum--luminosity relation for the analyzed stars. Although consistent
with previous results by Puls et al. (1996, A&A 305, 171) for Galactic stars,
our relation is better defined due to a reduction of errors related to stellar
distances and points to a possible separation between extreme Of stars (Of+,

  For materials science, work has focused on extending the support for
multichannel analyzers and for fast data acquisition using quick scans. MX MCA
support has focused on the development of interfaces to the X-Ray
Instrumentation Associates DXP-2X and X10P (Saturn) MCAs. The MX DXP-2X support
has been used by MR-CAT at the Advanced Photon Source to readout a 13-element
Ge detector at input count rates of up to 1.5*10^6 counts per second per
detector channel. The other major addition is support for quick scans using
multichannel scalers. Quick scanning is now routinely used for XAFS and
diffraction measurements at MR-CAT and will soon be implemented on some MX
crystallography beamlines as well. We have also begun work to allow XIA MCAs to
be read out during quick scans.
  For protein crystallography, we have primarily focused on implementing MX for
new beamlines, namely, SER-CAT at the APS and GCPCC at CAMD, with others
pending at the APS. Progress has also been made on the integration of MX with
vendor CCD and robotics software.

the solutions of the biconfluent Heun equation, we compute the eigenstates and

of three independent anyons which have their angular momenta fixed by the value
of the magnetic field and specified by a dimensionless parameter $C \simeq

(quantum) Calogero-Moser-Sutherland (CMS) models. We stress the remarkable fact
that this extension is completely captured by the insertion of a fermionic
exchange operator in the Hamiltonian: sCMS models ({\it s} for supersymmetric)
are nothing but special exchange-type CMS models. Under the appropriate
projection, the conserved charges can thus be formulated in terms of the
standard Dunkl operators. This is illustrated in the rational case, where the
explicit form of the 4N (N being the number of bosonic variables) conserved
charges is presented, together with their full algebra. The existence of 2N
commuting bosonic charges settles the question of the integrability of the
srCMS model. We then prove its superintegrability by displaying 2N-2 extra
independent charges commuting with the Hamiltonian. In the second part, we
consider the supersymmetric version of the trigonometric case (stCMS model) and
review the construction of its eigenfunctions, the Jack superpolynomials. This
leads to closed-form expressions, as determinants of determinants involving
supermonomial symmetric functions. Here we focus on the main ideas and the
generic aspects of the construction: those applicable to all models whether
supersymmetric or not. Finally, the possible Lie superalgebraic structure
underlying the stCMS model and its eigenfunctions is briefly considered.

by alternation of high- and low frequency activities appears. The mean field
motion obeys a stochastic process with state-dependent noise, and the above

approximations of chaotic maps showing deterministic diffusion, and represent
one-dimensional versions of a Lorentz gas with polygonal obstacles (e.g., the
Ehrenfest wind tree model). In particular, a simple construction shows that
these maps define non-chaotic billiards in space-time. The models exhibit, in a
wide range of the parameters, the same diffusive behavior of the corresponding

diffusive behavior in one-dimensional, non-chaotic systems: i) a finite-size,

primordial nucleosynthesis in baryon inhomogeneous cosmological models. To
calculate the thermonuclear reaction rate in a wide range of temperatures, we
numerically integrate the thermal average of cross sections assuming a
two-steps formation through a metastable $^{8}$Be. Off-resonant and on-resonant
contributions from the ground state in $^{8}$Be are taken into account. As
input cross section, we adopt the latest experimental data by
photodisintegration of $^{9}$Be with laser-electron photon beams, which covers
all relevant resonances in $^{9}$Be. We provide the reaction rate for
$\alpha(\alpha n,\gamma)^{9}$Be in the temperature range from T$_{9}$=10$^{-3}$
to T$_{9}$=10$^{1}$ both in the tabular form and in the analytical form. The
calculated reaction rate is compared with the reaction rates of the CF88 and
the NACRE compilations. The CF88 rate is valid at $T_{9} > 0.028$ due to lack
of the off-resonant contribution. The CF88 rate differs from the present rate
by a factor of two in a temperature range $T_{9} \geq 0.1$. The NACRE rate,
which adopted different sources of experimental information on resonance states
in $^{9}$Be, is 4--12 times larger than the present rate at $T_{9} \leq 0.028$,

version omits a crucial detail. As a result it disagrees with quantum
mechanics. It also violates signal locality. The unpublished version agrees
with quantum mechanics. However, it violates the condition of parameter
independence, as Myrvold has previously shown.

processes from experimental noisy data. Particularly, a generic quantum process
may be estimated simultaneously with unknown quantum probe states provided that
measurements on probe and transformed probe states are available. Drawbacks of
various approximate treatments are considered.
