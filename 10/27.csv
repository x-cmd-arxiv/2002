predicts galaxy masses within about 100 kpc are dominated by dark halos of
planetary mass primordial-fog-particles (PFPs) in dark
proto-globular-star-clusters (PGCs). According to our interpretation, stars and
young-globular-clusters (YGCs) appear out of the dark as merging galaxy
components VV29cdef move through the baryonic-dark-matter halo of the larger
galaxy VV29a creating luminous star-wakes. Frozen PFP planets are evaporated by
radiation and tidal forces of the intruders. Friction from the gas accelerates
an accretional cascade of PFPs to form larger planets, stars and YGCs of the
filamentary galaxy VV29b. Star-wakes show that galaxy VV29c, identified as a
blue dwarf by radio telescope observations of gas density and velocity (Briggs
et al. 2001), with companions VV29def entered the dark halo of the larger VV29a
galaxy at a radius 130 kpc and then spiraled in on different tracks toward
frictional capture by the VV29a core. A previously dark dwarf galaxy is
identified from a Keck spectrographic study showing a VV29c star-wake dense
cluster of YGCs aligned to 1 degree in a close straight row (Tran et al. 2003).

progenitors of planetary nebulae lose mass at extremely high rate, in what is
termed a superwind. We show that the existence of this superwind during the
post-AGB phase cannot be explained with models where the stellar effective
temperature is the sole main physical parameter which determine the mass loss
rate. Instead, we argue that the envelope structure, in particular the entropy
and density gradients, should be among the main parameters which determine the
mass loss rate on the tip of the AGB and the early post-AGB evolutionary
phases. The entropy profile becomes steeper and the density profile becomes
shallower as the star becomes hotter on the early post-AGB phase, until the
star heats-up to about 8000 K. We do not propose a new mass loss mechanism, but
rather mention several mechanisms by which these profiles may influence the
mass loss rate within the popular mechanism for mass loss on the AGB, where
pulsations coupled with radiation pressure on dust cause the high mass loss
rate.

performed by the worker (single ``machine'') who performs the tasks. A typical
worker's objective is to minimize the amount of work he does (he is ``lazy''),
or more generally, to schedule as inefficiently (in some sense) as possible.
The worker is subject to the constraint that he must be busy when there is work
that he can do; we make this notion precise both in the preemptive and
nonpreemptive settings. The resulting class of ``perverse'' scheduling
problems, which we denote ``Lazy Bureaucrat Problems,'' gives rise to a rich
set of new questions that explore the distinction between maximization and
minimization in computing optimal schedules.

"physics/0210108","Andrew Allison","Andrew Allison and Derek Abbott","Parameter identification using the Hilbert transform","6 pages, 2 figures, LaTeX source in AIP style",,,,"physics.data-an",,"  Many physical systems can be adequately modelled using a second order
approximation. The problem of plant identification reduces to the problem of
estimating the position of a single pair of complex conjugate poles. One
approach to the problem is to apply the method of least squares to the time
domain data. This type of computation is best carried out in ""batch"" mode and
applies to an entire data set. Another approach would be to design an adaptive
filter and to use autoregressive, AR, techniques. This would be well suited to
continuous real-time data and could track slow changes on the underlying plant.
I this paper we present a very fast but approximate technique for the
estimation of the position of a single pair of complex conjugate poles, using
the Hilbert transform to reconstruct the analytic signal.

  phase transition of D-, L-, and DL-alanine","13 pages,9 figures",,,,"physics.bio-ph",,"  Chiral molecules are characterized by a specific optical rotation angle. An
experimental method was presented to dissect the temperature dependence of the
optical rotation angle with the molecular chirality of D-alanine, L-alanine and
DL-alanine crystals. Salam hypothesis predicted that quantum mechanical
cooperative and condensation phenomena may give rise to a second order phase
transition below a critical temperature linking the transformation of D-amino
acids to L-amino acids due to parity-violating energy difference. The
temperature- dependent measurement of the optical rotation angle of D-, L- and
DL-alanine crystals provided the direct evidence of the phase transition, but
denied the configuration change from D-alanine to L-alanine. New views on Salam
hypothesis are presented to demonstrate its importance in the application of
low temperature enantiomeric separation and the origin of biochirality.

report the results of many-body calculations in which an
experimentally-measurable quantum coherence phenomenon is significantly
enhanced by non-Markovian dynamics arising from the noise source.
