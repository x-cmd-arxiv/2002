comes from a ~3"" diameter structure whose elongation is approximately east-west
and whose centroid is coincident within the astrometric errors with the
brightest X-ray and rest-UV peak (L1). The line data show that this structure
is most likely a rapidly rotating disk. Its rotation velocity of >420 km/s

the shear correlation originated from the gravitational lensing, we adopt the
aperture mass variance. We detect a non-zero E mode variance on scales between
2 and 40arcmin. We also detect a small but non-zero B mode variance on scales
larger than 5arcmin. We compare the measured E mode variance to the model
predictions in CDM cosmologies using maximum likelihood analysis. A
four-dimensional space is explored, which examines sigma_8, Omega_m, Gamma and
zs (a mean redshift of galaxies). We include three possible sources of error:
statistical noise, the cosmic variance estimated using numerical experiments,
and a residual systematic effect estimated from the B mode variance. We derive
joint constraints on two parameters by marginalizing over the two remaining
parameters. We obtain an upper limit of Gamma<0.5 for zs>0.9 (68% confidence).
For a prior Gamma\in[0.1,0.4] and zs\in[0.6,1.4], we find
sigma_8=(0.50_{-0.16}^{+0.35})Omega_m^{-0.37} for flat cosmologies and
sigma_8=(0.51_{-0.16}^{+0.29})Omega_m^{-0.34}$ for open cosmologies (95%

one-dimensional confidence interval on sigma_8 for the 95.4% level,
0.62<\sigma_8<1.32 for zs\in[0.6,1.4]. Information on the redshift distribution
of galaxies is key to obtaining a correct cosmological constraint. An
independent constraint on Gamma from other observations is useful to tighten
the constraint.

addressed on ENGIN-X by writing a new piece of software which provides support
for many of these operations. The approach is based on a virtual lab consisting
of three dimensional models of the sample and lab equipment such as collimators

the measurement sequence using automatically generated machine control scripts,

geometrical edge barrier and bulk pinning at the strip's critical current Ic,
where a longitudinal voltage first appears. We calculate Ic and find its
dependence upon a perpendicular applied magnetic field Ha. The behavior is
governed by a parameter p, defined as the ratio of the bulk-pinning critical
current Ip to the geometrical-barrier critical current Is0. We find that when p

travelling at the speed of light(c). This is done by completing the 3-velocity
v of a test particle to the speed of light by adding an auxiliary 3-velocity
component z for the particle. According to the observations and laws of physics
defined in our spacetime these vectors are generalized to domains and then two
methods are developed to define c domain in terms of our spacetime(v domain).
By using these methods the formalism is applied on relativistic quantum theory
and general theory of relativity. From these, the relation between the
formalism and Mach's principle is investigated. The ideas and formulae
developed from application of the formalism on general relativity are compared
with the characteristics of anomalous accelerations detected on Pioneer 10/11,
Ulysses and Galileo spacecrafts and an explanation according to the formalism
is suggested. Possible relationships between Mach's principle and the
nondeterministic nature of the universe are also explored. In this study Mach's
principle, on which current debate still continues, is expressed from an
unconventional point of view, as a naturally arising consequence of the

  This is obtained as a corollary of our more general result that for any fixed
integers $m>1, n>0$ there is an exponentially generic class of $m$-generator
$n$-relator groups where every group has only one Nielsen equivalence class of
$m$-tuples generating non-free subgroups. This means that a group $G$ in this
class has has only one non-free $m$-generated subgroup, namely $G$ itself.
Hence for any homomorphism for an $m$-generated group to $G$ the image of this

homomorphisms from $G$ to itself this implies that $G$ is co-Hopfian. Moreover,
every automorphism of $G$ is ""freely induced"", that is, it lifts to an

  velocity distribution","6 pages with no figure",,,,"nucl-th astro-ph cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  The Coulomb barrier is in general much higher than thermal energy. Nuclear
fusion reactions occur only among few protons and nuclei with higher relative
energies than Coulomb barrier. It is the equilibrium velocity distribution of
these high-energy protons and nuclei that participates in determining the rate
of nuclear fusion reactions. In the circumstance it is inappropriate to use the
Maxwellian velocity distribution for calculating the nuclear fusion reaction
rate. We use the relativistic equilibrium velocity distribution for this
purpose. The rate based on the relativistic equilibrium velocity distribution
has a reduction factor with respect to that based on the Maxwellian
distribution, which factor depends on the temperature, reduced mass and atomic
numbers of the studied nuclear fusion reactions. This signifies much to the
solar neutrino problem.

  Association Symposium in memory of the distinguished philosopher David Lewis,
  Milwaukee, November 2002. This version includes significant additions to
  Section 5.1. This version is forthcoming in `Formal Teleology and Causality',
  ed. M. Stoeltzner, P. Weingartner, Paderborn, Germany: Mentis. A precis of
  the first half of the paper is forthcoming in the journal Philosophy of
  Science",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.gen-ph",,"  This paper discusses some of the modal involvements of analytical mechanics.
I first review the elementary aspects of the Lagrangian, Hamiltonian and
Hamilton-Jacobi approaches. I then discuss two modal involvements; both are
related to David Lewis' work on modality, especially on counterfactuals.
  The first is the way Hamilton-Jacobi theory uses ensembles, i.e. sets of
possible initial conditions. The structure of this set of ensembles remains to
be explored by philosophers.
  The second is the way the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches' variational
principles state the law of motion by mentioning contralegal dynamical
evolutions. This threatens to contravene the principle that any actual truth,
in particular an actual law, is made true by actual facts. Though this threat
can be avoided, at least for simple mechanical systems, it repays scrutiny; not
least because it leads to some open questions.

  abstract identifier NOBUGS/034",,,"NOBUGS/034","physics.data-an physics.ins-det",,"  The overall design of the Integrated Spectral Analysis Workbench (ISAW),
being developed at Argonne, provides for an extensible, highly interactive,
collaborating set of viewers for neutron scattering data. Large arbitrary
collections of spectra from multiple detectors can be viewed as an image, a
scrolled list of individual graphs, or using a 3D representation of the
instrument showing the detector positions. Data from an area detector can be
displayed using a contour or intensity map as well as an interactive table.
Selected spectra can be displayed in tables or on a conventional graph. A
unique characteristic of these viewers is their interactivity and coordination.
The position ""pointed at"" by the user in one viewer is sent to other viewers of
the same DataSet so they can track the position and display relevant
information. Specialized viewers for single crystal neutron diffractometers are
being developed. A ""proof-of-concept"" viewer that directly displays the 3D
reciprocal lattice from a complete series of runs on a single crystal
diffractometer has been implemented.
