  This paper reviews current progress with 6-10 m class telescopes in following
up sources discovered in deep X-ray surveys, including results from several

promising candidates for the origin of the hard (2-10 keV) X-ray background

deep Chandra images have revealed surprising numbers of apparently normal
galaxies at modest redshift. Such objects represent ~40-60% of the sources
classified in deep Chandra surveys, raising the possibility that the X-ray
galaxy population has evolved with cosmic time. Alternatively, most of the
faint X-ray galaxies in question are so distant that their angular diameters
are comparable to the slit widths used in ground-based spectroscopic

(``hidden'') by host-galaxy light. To test this hypothesis, we have obtained
integrated spectra of a sample of nearby, well-studied Seyfert 2 galaxies. The
data, which accurately simulate observations of distant Chandra sources,
demonstrate convincingly that the defining spectral signatures of Seyfert 2s
can be hidden by light from their host galaxies. In fact, 60% of the observed
objects would not be classified as Seyfert 2s on the basis of their integrated
spectra, similar to the fraction of faint X-ray sources identified with

properties of emission-line nuclei in the Palomar spectroscopic survey of

environments. The distinguishing traits emerge on nuclear scales. Compared with
LINERs, Seyfert nuclei are an order of magnitude more luminous and exhibit
higher electron densities and internal extinction. We suggest that Seyfert
galaxies possess characteristically more gas-rich circumnuclear regions, and
hence a more abundant fuel reservoir and plausibly higher accretion rates. The
differences between the ionization state of the narrow emission-line regions of
Seyferts and LINERs can be partly explained by the differences in their nebular
properties. Transition-type objects are consistent with being composite
(LINER/\hii) systems. With very few exceptions, the stellar population within
the central few hundred parsecs of the host galaxies is uniformly old, a
finding that presents a serious challenge to starburst or post-starburst models
for these objects. Seyferts and LINERs have virtually indistinguishable
velocity fields as inferred from their line widths and line asymmetries. All
three classes of objects obey a strong correlation between line width and line
luminosity. We argue that the angular momentum content of circumnuclear gas may
be an important factor in determining whether a nucleus becomes active.

bulge luminosity and with the velocity dispersion of the bulge stars, sigma_*.
An important clue to the origin of this correlation would be an observational
determination of the evolution, if any, in the M_BH - sigma_* relationship as a
function of cosmic time. The high luminosity of QSOs affords the potential for
studies at large redshifts. We derive black hole masses from the continuum
luminosity and the width of the broad Hbeta line and sigma_* from the width of

  Cluster Astronomy, Eds. Piotto et al., ASP Conf. Ser",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Improved observations of globular clusters are uncovering a large number of
radio pulsars and of X-ray sources. The latter include binaries in which a
neutron star or a white dwarf accretes matter from a companion, recycled
pulsars, and magnetically active binaries. Most of these sources originate from
close encounters between stars in the cluster core; magnetically active
binaries and some cataclysmic variables have evolved from primordial binaries.
The formation rate through close encounters scales differently with the central
density and core radius of the cluster than the probability for a single binary
to be perturbed by an encounter. This is exploited in some preliminary
observational tests of the close encounter hypothesis.
  Accreting black holes have been found in globular clusters with other
galaxies; the absence of such holes in the Milky Way clusters is compatible
with the small number expected.

semi-flexible rod-like virus fd is measured by x-ray diffraction as a function
of concentration and ionic strength. The angular distribution of the scattered
intensity from a single-domain nematic phase of fd arises from only the single
particle orientational distribution function at high angle but it also includes
spatial and orientational correlations at low angle. Experimental measurements
of the orientational distribution function from both the interparticle and
intraparticle scattering were made to test whether the correlations present in
interparticle scatter influence the measurement of the single particle
orientational distribution function. It was found that the two types of scatter
yield consistent values for the nematic order parameter. It was also found that
x-ray diffraction is insensitive to the orientational distribution function's
precise form, and the measured angular intensity distribution is described
equally well by both Onsager's trial function and a Gaussian. At high ionic
strength the order parameter S of the nematic phase coexisting with the
isotropic phase approaches theoretical predictions for long semi-flexible rods
S=0.55, but deviations from theory increase with decreasing ionic strength. The
concentration dependence of the nematic order parameter was also found to
better agree with theoretical predictions at high ionic strength, indicating
that electrostatic interactions have a measurable effect on the nematic order
parameter. The measured x-ray order parameters are also shown to be
proportional to the measured birefringence and the saturation birefringence of
fd is measured, enabling a simple, inexpensive way to measure the order
parameter.

isotropic as in simple metals but has $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry with lines of
nodes. In a fascinating thermal transport experiment on a high-$T_c$
superconductor, Krishana et al \cite{Krishana} have reported mysterious
magnetic field induced first order transitions from a superconducting state
with gap nodes to a state without gap nodes. We show here that this is an
experimental manifestation of a novel {\it macroscopic} quantum phenomenon
induced by the magnetic field, qualitatively different from the usual quantum
Hall effects. It corresponds to the {\it quantization of the superfluid
density} in a superconductor with gap nodes due to the generation of Confined
Field Induced Density Waves (CFIDW) in the node regions of the Fermi surface.
The Landau numbers $L$ are not sufficient to index these macroscopic quantum
states and the addition of a new quantum number $\zeta$ is necessary. Distinct
qualitative implications of this non-integer $|L,\zeta>$ quantization are also
evident in a number of recent unexplained experimental reports in the cuprates.

  (micro-) refrigerators operating below 150 K. The microscopic approach to
cooling is based on the ""phonon deficit effect"" in nonequilibrium regime of
tunnel junctions. This effect can be improved by use of phonon filters placed
between the tunnel junction and the heath-bath. Such a filter can be the Bragg
interference superlattice (Bragg's grating) which is well studied for problems
of optical communications. Bragg interference filters are used also for
detection of phonons emitted by tunnel junctions. To enhance the refrigeration
process one needs filters with very broad spectral transmission properties or a
large transmission band with one or two narrow stop bands. The type of the
needed filter will depend on the types of the used tunnel junction.

as a clear hump in the resistivity measurements, establishing the magnetic

question the same to co-existence of the two at microscopic level. Our results

several German freeways. It manages to make sense out of data where
conventional visualization techniques fail. By ignoring up to 65% of the
detectors and applying the method to the reduced data set, we show that the
results are robust. The method works well if the distances between neighbouring
detector cross sections do not exceed 3 km.

bilinear function of the data) for the detection of poorly modeled
gravitational transients of short duration. We point out that all such
detection methods are equivalent to passing the signal through a filter bank
and linearly combine the output energy. Existing methods for the choice of the
filter bank and of the weight parameters rely essentially on the two following
ideas: (i) the use of the likelihood function based on a (possibly
non-informative) statistical model of the signal and the noise, (ii) the use of
Monte-Carlo simulations for the tuning of parametric filters to get the best
detection probability keeping fixed the false alarm rate. We propose a third
approach according to which the filter bank is ""learned"" from a set of training
data. By-products of this viewpoint are that, contrarily to previous methods,
(i) there is no requirement of an explicit description of the probability
density function of the data when the signal is present and (ii) the filters we
use are non-parametric. The learning procedure may be described as a two step
process: first, estimate the mean and covariance of the signal with the
training data; second, find the filters which maximize a contrast criterion
referred to as deflection between the ""noise only"" and ""signal+noise""
hypothesis. The deflection is homogeneous to the signal-to-noise ratio and it
uses the quantities estimated at the first step. We apply this original method
to the problem of the detection of supernovae core collapses. We use the
catalog of waveforms provided recently by Dimmelmeier et al. to train our
algorithm. We expect such detector to have better performances on this
particular problem provided that the reference signals are reliable.

equally applies to any finite dimensional Schr\""{o}dinger equation in the
presence of a stochastic external field. New integrodifferential equations
valid for finite correlated processes are obtained for the first time. For the
particular case of exponentially correlated processes a second order ordinary
equation is obtained. As a consequence, the Redfield equation valid for
Gaussian delta-correlated noise is rederived in a simple way: it has been
obtained directly and as the zero-order term of an asymptotic expansion in the
inverse of the correlation length. The formalism, together with the quantum
correlation theorem is applied to the computation of higher moments and

suggesting that there does not exist a corresponding CFT. We obtain the

generalized crossing probabilities whose coefficients are multipoint CFT

""local"" U(1) group. This group can also be seen as a central extension,
parametrized by both the mass and the electric charge, of an

moving in the presence of an electromagnetic field. Then we try the
gravitational interaction of a particle by turning into ""local"" the space-time
translations. However, promoting to ""local"" the space-time subgroup of the true
symmetry of the quantum free relativistic particle, i.e. the centrally extended

answer was negative. In this paper, we will revisit the same question for the
discrete time Fourier transform uncertainty principle. We will show that the
discrete time Fourier transform uncertainty principle plays a fundamental role
in showing that Shor's type of quantum algorithms has efficient running time
and conclude that the discrete time uncertainty principle is an aid in our
current formulation and understanding of Shor's type of quantum algorithms. It
turns out that for these algorithms, the probability of measuring an element in
some set $T$ (at the end of the algorithm) can be written in terms of the
time-limiting and band-limiting operators from finite Fourier analysis.
Associated with these operators is the finite Fourier transform uncertainty
principle. The uncertainty principle provides a lower bound for the above
probability. We will derive lower bounds for these types of probabilities in
general. We will call these lower bounds quantum algorithm uncertainty
principles or QAUP. QAUP are important because they give us some sense of the
probability of measuring something desirable. We will use these lower bounds to
derive Shor's factoring and discrete log algorithms.

which is fixed by a revolving joint at a base point: one wants to bring the
line from its initial position to a final position by a continuous motion in
the space. The final goal is to construct an algorithm which will perform this
task once the initial and final positions are given.
  Any such motion planning algorithm will have instabilities, which are caused
by topological reasons. A general approach to study instabilities of robot
motion was suggested recently by the first named author. With any
path-connected topological space X one associates a number TC(X), called the
topological complexity of X. This number is of fundamental importance for the
motion planning problem: TC(X) determines character of instabilities which have
all motion planning algorithms in X.
  In the present paper we study the topological complexity of real projective
spaces. In particular we compute TC(RP^n) for all n<24. Our main result is that
(for n distinct from 1, 3, 7) the problem of calculating of TC(RP^n) is
equivalent to finding the smallest k such that RP^n can be immersed into the
Euclidean space R^{k-1}.

of information processing, holds that any logically irreversible manipulation
of information, such as the erasure of a bit or the merging of two computation
paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding entropy increase in
non-information bearing degrees of freedom of the information processing
apparatus or its environment. Conversely, it is generally accepted that any
logically reversible transformation of information can in principle be
accomplished by an appropriate physical mechanism operating in a
thermodynamically reversible fashion. These notions have sometimes been
criticized either as being false, or as being trivial and obvious, and
therefore unhelpful for purposes such as explaining why Maxwell's Demon cannot
violate the Second Law of thermodynamics. Here I attempt to refute some of the
arguments against Landauer's principle, while arguing that although in a sense
it is indeed a trivial and obvious restatement of the Second Law, it still has
considerable pedagogic and explanatory power, especially in the context of
other influential ideas in 19'th and 20'th century physics. Similar arguments

detectors with solid photocathodes. The main advantage of these detectors is
that rather high gains (>10E4) can be achieved in a single multiplication step.
This is possible by, for instance, exploiting the secondary electron
multiplication and limiting the energy of the steamers by distributed
resistivity. The single step approach also allows a very good position
resolution to be achieved in some devices: 50 micron on line without applying
any treatment method (like center of gravity). The main focus of our report is
new fields of applications for these detectors and the optimization of their
designs for such purposes.

to the well known Bohr frequency, given in terms of the first and second
resonance energies of the doublet, and the two others, represent a coupling
with the incidence energy $E$. This allows to manipulate the above frequencies
to control the tunneling transient behavior of the probability density in the

  559, pp. 31-65 (Springer, Berlin, 2000)",,,"quant-ph",,"  The processes of radiation damping and decoherence in Quantum Electrodynamics
are studied from an open system's point of view. Employing functional
techniques of field theory, the degrees of freedom of the radiation field are
eliminated to obtain the influence phase functional which describes the reduced
dynamics of the matter variables. The general theory is applied to the dynamics
of a single electron in the radiation field. From a study of the wave packet
dynamics a quantitative measure for the degree of decoherence, the decoherence
function, is deduced. The latter is shown to describe the emergence of
decoherence through the emission of bremsstrahlung caused by the relative
motion of interfering wave packets. It is argued that this mechanism is the
most fundamental process in Quantum Electrodynamics leading to the destruction
of coherence, since it dominates for short times and because it is at work even
in the electromagnetic field vacuum at zero temperature. It turns out that
decoherence trough bremsstrahlung is very small for single electrons but
extremely large for superpositions of many-particle states.
