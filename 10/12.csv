shear and cosmic microwave background polarization fields, is a statistical
measure of non-Gaussian signals. At each vertex of a triangle, the shear field
has two independent components. The resulting eight possible 3PCFs were
recently investigated by Schneider & Lombardi (2002) and Zaldarriaga &
Scoccimarro (2002). Using rotation and parity transformations they addressed
the question: how many non-zero components for the shear 3PCF exist? We address
this question using an analytical model and measurements from ray-tracing
simulations. We show that all the eight 3PCFs are generally non-zero and have
comparable amplitude. These eight 3PCFs can be used to improve the
signal-to-noise from survey data and their configuration dependence can be used
to separate the contribution from E and B-modes. We estimate the
signal-to-noise for measuring the shear 3PCF from weak lensing surveys using
simulated maps that include the noise due to intrinsic ellipticities. A deep
lensing survey with area exceeding 10 square degrees would allow for the
detection of the shear 3PCFs, but a survey area of order 100 square degrees is
needed for accurate measurements.

population is expected to drive changes in the emission line properties. This
evolution is usually studied theoretically, with a combination of evolutionary
synthesis models for the spectral energy distribution of starbursts and
photoionization calculations. In this paper we present a more empirical
approach to this issue. We apply empirical population synthesis techniques to
samples of Starburst and HII galaxies in order to measure their evolutionary
state and correlate the results with their emission line properties. A couple
of useful tools are introduced which greatly facilitate the interpretation of
the synthesis: (1) an evolutionary diagram, whose axis are the strengths of the
young, intermediate age and old components of the stellar population mix, and
(2) the mean age of stars associated with the starburst, $\ov{t}_{SB}$. These
tools are tested with grids of theoretical galaxy spectra and found to work
very well even when only a small number of observed properties (absorption line
equivalent widths and continuum colors) is used in the synthesis.
  Starburst nuclei and HII galaxies are found to lie on a well defined sequence
in the evolutionary diagram. Using the empirically defined mean starburst age
in conjunction with emission line data we have verified that the equivalent
widths of H$\beta$ and [OIII] decrease for increasing $\ov{t}_{SB}$. The same
evolutionary trend was identified for line ratios indicative of the gas
excitation, although no clear trend was identified for metal rich systems. All
these results are in excellent agreement with long known, but little tested,
theoretical expectations.

overflow starting from the helium main sequence to after the ignition of carbon
burning in the core. We have also examined the evolution into a common envelope
phase via secular instability, delayed dynamical instability, and the
consequence of matter filling the neutron star's Roche lobe. The survival of
some close He-star neutron-star binaries through the last mass transfer episode
(either dynamically stable or unstable mass transfer phase) leads to the
formation of extremely short-period double neutron star systems (with
P<~0.1days). In addition, we find that systems throughout the entire calculated
mass range can evolve into a common envelope phase, depending on the orbital
period at the onset of mass transfer. The critical orbital period below which
common envelope evolution occurs generally increases with M_He. In addition, a
common envelope phase may occur during a short time for systems characterized
by orbital periods of 0.1-0.5 days at low He-star masses (~ 2.6-3.3Msun).

the predicted detection rate of inspiral events by ground-based
gravitational-wave detectors and impacts their merger location in host galaxies

sources, for example, the mass released by stellar evolution in the initial ~1

collisions of stars. We find that collisions between main-sequence stars cannot

cooling, nongravitational heating and cooling plus heating models can
simultaneously explain the observed global X-ray properties (entropy and X-ray
luminosity distributions) of groups and clusters and the residual soft X-ray
background (XRB) after discrete sources are removed. Within the framework of
typical cold dark matter structure formation characterized by an amplitude of
matter power spectrum sigma_8=0.9, it is argued that while radiative cooling
alone is able to marginally reproduce the entropy floor detected in the central
regions of groups and clusters, it is insufficient to account for the
steepening of the X-ray luminosity - temperature relation for groups and the
unresolved soft XRB. A phenomenological preheating model, in which either an
extra specific energy budget or an entropy floor is added to the hot gas in
groups and clusters, fails in the recovery of at least one of the X-ray
observed features. Finally, the soft XRB predicted by our combined model of
cooling plus heating exceeds the observational upper limits by a factor of ~2,
if the model is required to reproduce the observed entropy and X-ray luminosity
- temperature relationships of groups and clusters. If the discrepancy is not a
result of the oversimplification of our analytic models, this implies that
either our current understanding of the physical processes of the hot gas is
still incomplete, or the normalization of the present power spectrum has been
systematically overestimated. For the latter, both the X-ray properties of
groups and clusters and the XRB predicted by preheating model and cooling plus
heating model can be reconciled with the X-ray observations if a lower value of
the normalization parameter sigma_8 \approx 0.7 is assumed.

planets have been proposed as a possible explanation for the surprising orbital
properties of extrasolar planetary systems. In particular, dynamical
instabilities seem to provide a natural mechanism for producing the highly
eccentric orbits seen in many systems. Previously, we performed numerical
integrations for the dynamical evolution of planetary systems containing two
giant planets of equal masses initially in nearly circular orbits very close to
the dynamical stability limit. We found the ratio of collisions to ejections in
these simulations was greater than the ratio of circular orbits to eccentric
orbits among the known extrasolar planets. Further, the mean eccentricity of
the planets remaining after an ejection was larger than the mean eccentricity
of the known extrasolar planets. Recently, we have performed additional
integrations, generalizing to consider two planets of unequal masses. Our new
simulations reveal that the two-planet scattering model can produce a
distribution of eccentricities consistent with the observed eccentricity
distribution for plausible mass distributions. Additionally, this model
predicts a maximum eccentricity of about 0.8, in agreement with observations.
Early results from simulations of three equal-mass planets also reveal a
reduced frequency of collisions and a broad range of final eccentricities for
the retained inner planet.

Since most of the light comes from a small fraction of the planet's surface,
the temporal flux variability can be quite significant, $\sim$ 10-100%. In
addition, for cloudless Earth-like extrasolar planet models, qualitative
changes to the surface (such as ocean fraction, ice cover) significantly affect
the light curve. Clouds dominate the temporal variability of the Earth but can
be coherent over several days. In contrast to Earth's temporal variability, a
uniformly, heavily clouded planet (e.g. Venus), would show almost no flux
variability. We present light curves for an unresolved Earth and for Earth-like

cosmological parameters like the rate of expansion or the mass density are to
be considered as volume-averaged quantities and only these can be compared with
observations. For this reason the relevant parameters are intrinsically
scale-dependent and one wishes to control this dependence without restricting
the cosmological model by unphysical assumptions. In the latter respect we
contrast our way to approach the averaging problem in relativistic cosmology
with shortcomings of averaged Newtonian models. Explicitly, we investigate the
scale-dependence of Eulerian volume averages of scalar functions on Riemannian
three-manifolds. We propose a complementary view of a Lagrangian smoothing of
(tensorial) variables as opposed to their Eulerian averaging on spatial
domains. This program is realized with the help of a global Ricci deformation
flow for the metric. We explain rigorously the origin of the Ricci flow which,
on heuristic grounds, has already been suggested as a possible candidate for
smoothing the initial data set for cosmological spacetimes. The smoothing of
geometry implies a renormalization of averaged spatial variables. We discuss
the results in terms of effective cosmological parameters that would be
assigned to the smoothed cosmological spacetime.

that some recently discovered {\it weak self-tuning} solutions can be viewed as
blowing-up this one point into a band of some parameter. These weak self-tuning
solutions may have a virtue that only de Sitter space solutions are allowed
outside this band, allowing an inflationary period. We adopt the hybrid
inflation at the brane to exit from this inflationary phase and to enter into
the standard Big Bang cosmology.

a U(2) family of different connection conditions which include as a special
case the familiar one that arises under the Dirac delta-potential. Similarly,
each of the walls at x = l and x = -l admits a U(1) family of boundary
conditions including the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary conditions. Under
these general connection/boundary conditions, the system is shown to possess an
N = 1 or N = 2 SUSY for various choices of the singularity and the walls, and
the SUSY is found to be `good' or `broken' depending on the choices made. We
use the supercharge which allows for a constant shift in the energy, and argue

states that respect the connection/boundary conditions specified by the
