recent study (Chitre & Jog 2002) of the 2MASS data for twenty-seven advanced

decreases exponentially with radius. Such a distribution normally characterizes
a rotationally supported disk in a spiral galaxy. Here we show from kinematic
data for two of these mergers, Arp 224 and Arp 214, that the main support
against gravitational collapse comes from pressure due to random motion of
stars as seen in an elliptical galaxy rather than from rotation. The origin of
the unusual combination of properties seen here is a puzzle. The standard
theoretical N-body models in the literature cannot account for these systems.
Further observational and dynamical studies of this new class of merger
remnants are needed, and would be important for understanding merger dynamics

Penrose scattering processes in the ergosphere of a supermassive Kerr black
hole. These GR model calculations reveal that the observed high energies and
luminosities of quasars and other active galactic nuclei, the collimated jets
about the polar axis, and the asymmetrical jets (which can be enhanced by
relativistic Doppler beaming effects) all are inherent properties of rotating
black holes. The Penrose scattered escaping relativistic particles exhibit
tightly wound coil-like cone distributions (highly collimated vortical jet
distributions) about the polar axis, with helical polar angles of escape
varying from 0.5-30 deg for the highest energy particles. The gravitomagnetic
field exerts a force acting on the momentum vectors of the incident and
scattered particles, causing asymmetrical particle jet emission above and below
the equatorial plane. When the accretion disk is assumed to be an ADAF,
energies as high as 54 GeV can be attained by these Penrose processes alone;
and when relativistic beaming is included, energies in the TeV range can be
achieved, agreeing with observations of some BL Lac objects. This
energy-momentum extraction model can be applied to any size black hole. When
this model is applied specifically to quasars 3C 279, 3C 273, Seyfert 1 galaxy
MCG--60-30-15, and galactic black hole source Cygnus X-1, their observed high
energy luminosity spectra in general can be explained. The consistency of these
Penrose model calculations with observations suggests that the external
magnetic field of the accretion disk plays a negligible role in the extraction
of energy-momentum from a rotating black hole, close to the event horizon,
where gravitational forces appear to be dominant.

X-ray spectral evolution of QSOs with time, up to redshift 3. Within the sample
there is no evidence for evolution of the optical to X-ray spectral index,
alpha-ox, with redshift, the mean value being -1.66 +/- 0.04. However, upon
comparing the values from the Bright Quasar Survey at low redshift (z < 0.5)

alpha-ox is noted for the more distant objects. In most of the sources there is
no significant requirement for a soft excess, although a weak thermal component

(by delta gamma=0.2) at higher energies (> 3 keV, QSO rest frame) for the

The shape of the IR excess from 1 micron all the way down to 850 micron can be
nearly perfectly fitted with a single blackbody function at T ~ 1150 K or
alternatively with a sum of blackbodies in a narrow temperature range. The
energy emitted in this IR continuum radiation is about one-third of the stellar
luminosity. We show that this blackbody radiation must be due to the presence
of a circumbinary disk with a large height. This disk must also be gas-rich, in
agreement with the observations of molecular bands in the ISO-SWS spectrum. We
present two possible scenario's for explaining the shape and the intensity of
the IR excess. The first scenario involves large grains (a >1 mm) that each
radiate like a blackbody. The second scenario argues that the blackbody
radiation is due to a very optically thick circumbinary disk. We investigate if
such a disk would indeed produce blackbody radiation by presenting results from
radiative transfer calculations. We further quantify the properties of such a
disk and its stability in the framework of (hydro)dynamics, grain settling,
radiation pressure and grain drift. The virtues and shortcomings of both models
for the origin of the IR blackbody are discussed by contrasting them with other
observations and assessing them in the framework of (binary) (post-)AGB

strong steepening of the radio spectrum of Coma C at high frequencies. Its
extent strongly depends on frequency, at 4.85 GHz it is only marginally
visible. The measurement at 4.85 GHz is the first flux density determination
for Coma C at this high frequency. In order to quantify the spectral steepening
we compare the expectations for the spectrum of Coma C with the observations,
resorting to basic models for radio halo formation. The in--situ acceleration
model provides the best fit to the data. From equipartition assumptions we
estimate a magnetic field strength $B_{eq}=0.57 (1+k)^{0.26}\mu G$ in the
intracluster medium of Coma, where k is the energy ratio of the positively and
negatively charged particles.

for the diffuse emission of the extended source 1253+275 ($S_{2.675GHz}=112\pm

overabundant relative to oxygen in Q0353-383 by a factor of ~15 compared to
solar ratios. This agreement among the diagnostics supports the use of these
lines for measuring BLR chemical abundances. If nitrogen behaves like a
secondary element, such that N/O is proportional to O/H, then the extreme
nitrogen enhancement in Q0353-383 implies a metallicity of ~15 times the solar

size to the ionized HII region. The CO clouds are hot (Tkin) = 150 K) and have
high molecular gas densities (n(H2) = 10**4 cm**-3) Molecular hydrogen probably
extends well beyond the CO boundaries. C+ column densities are more than an
order of magnitude higher than those of CO. The total mass of the complex is
about 10**6 M(sun) and molecular gas account for more than half of this. The
complex is excited by luminous stars reddened or obscured at visual, but
apparent at near-infrared wavelengths. The total embedded stellar mass may
account for about 10% of the total mass, and the mass of ionized gas for half

unifying physical framework of quantal density functional theory (Q-DFT). We

related to electron spin. However details of the mechanism of the structure are
not quite clear. Previously we approached the problem within the restricted
Hartree-Fock approximation. This calculation demonstrated a structure similar
to that observed experimentally. In the present work we perform restricted and
unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculations to analyze the validity of the
approximations. We also consider dependence of the effect on the electron
density in leads. The unrestricted Hartree-Fock method allows us to analyze
trapping of the single electron within the contact. Such trapping would result
in the Kondo model for the ``0.7 structure''. The present calculation confirms
the spin-dependent bound state picture and does not confirm the Kondo model
scenario.

magnetization and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements were performed.
FMR and magnetization data reveal a pronounced magnetic anisotropy, which
develops below the Curie temperature, $T_{\mathrm{C}}$, and increases strongly
towards lower temperatures. Increasing the Cu concentration reduces this
effect. At temperatures below 35 K the magnetoresistance, $MR = \frac{\rho(0) -
\rho(H)}{\rho(0)}$, exhibits a strong dependence on the direction of the
magnetic field, probably due to an enhanced anisotropy. Applying the field
along the hard axis leads to a change of sign and a strong increase of the
absolute value of the magnetoresistance. On the other hand the
magnetoresistance remains positive down to lower temperatures, exhibiting a
smeared out maximum with the magnetic field applied along the easy axis. The
results are discussed in the ionic picture using a triple-exchange model for
electron hopping as well as a half-metal utilizing a band picture.

obtained in factorization and QCD-improved factorization models. However there
are also long-distance charming penguin contributions which could give rise to
a strong phase due to the rescattering $D^{*}D^{*}_{s} \to K\pi$ etc. In this

significant for $B\to K\pi$ decays and, together with the tree and penguin

contain the square of the Riemann tensor and in case that the $R^2$-terms are
the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) combination, we find exact solutions. We investigate the
thermodynamics of these theories and find the Hawking-Page like phase
transition, which is the phase transition between the black hole (BH) spacetime
and the pure anti-deSitter (AdS) spacetime. From the viewpoint of the AdS/CFT
correspondence, such a phase transition may correspond to thermal transition of
dual CFT.
  An interesting feature of $R^2$-gravity is the possibility of the negative
(or zero) dS (or AdS) BH entropy, which depends on the parameters of the
$R^2$-terms. We speculate that the appearence of negative entropy may indicate
a new type instability where a transition between dS (AdS) BH with negative
entropy and AdS (dS) BH with positive entropy occurs.
  We also apply the GB gravity to the brane cosmology, where the brane moves in
the bulk AdS BH spacetime. By investigating the FRW-like equation, which
describes the motion of the brane, we find the behavior of the matter on the
brane. When the radius of the brane is large, the matter fields behave as CFT
but when the radius is small, the brane universe behaves as the universe with
dust or curvature dominant universe, depending on the parameters.

described by introducing Reggeized Born terms. It is found that the existing

with the model predictions. To describe the absolute values of the cross
sections it is necessary to introduce also suppression factors which can be
related to absorption corrections. Furthermore, assuming the SU(4) symmetry to
hold for Regge residues and the universality of absorption corrections we
calculate the cross section of the reaction $\pi^- p \to D^- \Lambda_c^+$.
Employing the latter results from $\pi^- p$ reactions we then estimate the
contributions of the pion exchange mechanism to the cross sections of the
reactions $NN \to NK\Lambda$ and $NN \to N\bar D \Lambda_c$ and compare them
with the contributions of the $K$ and $D$ exchanges. We find that the $NN$

respectively. Moreover, assuming the SU(4) symmetry to hold approximately for
the coupling constants $g_{ND \Lambda_c}$ = $g_{NK \Lambda}$ we analyze also
the production of leading $\Lambda_c$ hyperons in the reaction $NN \to

additional contributions, which are dependent on the wavelength, in the optical

applied to the axially symmetric graded index fiber. This results in the
wavelength-dependent modifications of the paraxial behaviour and the aberration
coefficients. Furthermore it predicts a wavelength-dependent image rotation. In
the low wavelength limit our formalism reproduces the Lie algebraic formalism
of optics. The Foldy-Wouthuysen technique employed by us is ideally suited for
the Lie algebraic approach to optics. The present study further strengthens the

certain conditions it becomes oscillatory in time. Here simple reaction models
are analyzed that capture such oscillations as well as the length distribution
of microtubules. We assume reaction conditions that are stationary over many
oscillation periods, and it is a Hopf bifurcation that leads to a persistent
oscillatory microtubule polymerization in these models. Analytical expressions
are derived for the threshold of the bifurcation and the oscillation frequency
in terms of reaction rates as well as typical trends of their parameter
dependence are presented. Both, a catastrophe rate that depends on the density
of {\it guanosine triphosphate} (GTP) liganded tubulin dimers and a delay
reaction, such as the depolymerization of shrinking microtubules or the decay
of oligomers, support oscillations. For a tubulin dimer concentration below the
threshold oscillatory microtubule polymerization occurs transiently on the
route to a stationary state, as shown by numerical solutions of the model
equations. Close to threshold a so--called amplitude equation is derived and it
is shown that the bifurcation to microtubule oscillations is supercritical.
