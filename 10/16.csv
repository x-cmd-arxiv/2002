amplitude of the signal on arc-minute scales is about 20%. This is a few times
larger than currently expected from weak lensing in LCDM but confirms, at a
higher significance, previous measurements by several groups. When compared to
the galaxy-galaxy correlation w_GG, a weak lensing interpretation indicates a
strong and steep non-linear amplitude for the underlaying matter fluctuations:
sigma=400 on scales of 0.2 Mpc/h, in contradiction with non-linear modeling of
LCDM fluctuations. We also detect a normalized skewness (galaxy-galaxy-QSO
correlation) of S_3=21 +/-6 at z=0.15 (S_3= 14 +/- 4 at z=0.35), which several
sigma low, as compared to LCDM expectations. These observational trends can be
reconciled with lensing in a flat Lambda universe with sigma_8=1, provided the
linear spectrum is steeper (n = 1) than in the LCDM model on these small
(cluster) scales. Under this interpretation, the galaxy distribution traces the
matter variance with an amplitude that is 100 times smaller: ie galaxies are
anti-bias with b=0.1 on small scales, increasing to b=1 at 10 Mpc/h.

gravitational lenses has been cited as evidence for significant small-scale
structure in lens galaxies. That claim has generally relied on detailed lens
modeling, so it is both model dependent and somewhat difficult to interpret. We
present a more robust and generic method for identifying lenses with
small-scale structure. For a close triplet of images associated with a source
near a cusp caustic, the sum of the signed magnifications should approximately
vanish. We derive realistic upper bounds on the sum, and argue that lenses with
flux ratios that significiantly violate the bounds can be said to have
structure in the lens potential on scales smaller than the image separation.
Five observed lenses have such flux ratio ``anomalies'': B2045+265, 1RXS
J1131-1231, and SDSS J0924+0219 have strong anomalies; B0712+472 has a strong
anomaly at optical/near-IR wavelengths and a marginal anomaly at radio
wavelengths; and RX J0911+0551 appears to have an anomaly, but this conclusion
is subject to uncertainties about octopole modes in early-type galaxies.
Analysis of the cusp relation does not identify the known anomaly in B1422+231,
so methods that are more sophisticated (and less generic) than the cusp
relation may be necessary to uncover flux ratio anomalies in some systems.
Although these flux ratio anomalies might represent milli- or micro-lensing, we
cannot identify the cause; we can only conclude that the lenses have
significant structure in the potential on scales smaller than the separation
between the images. Additional arguments must be invoked to specify the nature
of this small-scale structure. [Abridged]

considerably higher for the cool sample of Bergeron, Ruiz, and Leggett, and the
Holberg, Oswalt, and Sion sample of local white dwarfs that it is for the
generally-hotter white dwarfs of the Palomar Green Survey. We show that the
mean mass of magnetic white dwarfs in this survey is 0.93 solar masses or more,
so there may be a strong bias against their selection in the magnitude-limited
Palomar Green Survey. We argue that this bias is not as important in the
samples of cool and nearby white dwarfs. However, this bias may not account for
all of the difference in the magnetic fractions of these samples.
  It is not clear that the magnetic white dwarfs in the cool and local samples
are drawn from the same population as the hotter PG stars. In particular, two
or threee of the cool sample are low-mass white dwarfs in unresolved binary
systems. Moreover, there is a suggestion from the local sample that the
fractional incidence may increase with decreasing temperature, luminosity,
and/or cooling age. Overall, the true incidence of magnetism at the level of 2
megagauss or greater is at least 10%, and could be higher. Limited studies
capable of detecting lower field strengths down to 10 kilogauss suggest by
implication that the total fraction may be substantially higher than 10%.

on synthetic photometry using optical spectra of SN 2001el and optical and

mid-range decline rates to within 0.2 mag. Given the completeness of the light
curves and the elimination of filter-oriented systematic errors to some degree,
the data presented here will be useful for the construction of photometric

cold homogeneous conditions, as might result in regions where gas is swept up

that massive star formation does not require a depleted dust mixture, although
the use of dust at typical interstellar abundances does reduce the final

demonstrates approximate self-similarity (fractality) over almost four orders
of magnitude in scale, with the calculated fractal dimension d between
(approximately) 0.2 and 1.0. In all sources, the lower order structure
functions for the line-of-sight component of the velocity field are
satisfactorily approximated by power laws, with the exponents near their
classic Kolmogorov values for the high-Reynolds-number incompressible
turbulence. These two facts, as well as the observed significant excess of
large deviations of the two-point velocity increments from their mean values,
strongly suggest that the H2O masers in regions of star formation trace
turbulence. We propose a new conceptual model of these masers in which maser
hot spots originate at the sites of ultimate dissipation of highly supersonic
turbulence produced in the ambient gas by the intensive gas outflow from a
newly-born star. Due to the high brightness and small angular sizes of masing
hot spots and the possibility of measuring their positions and velocities with

GHz, to compare the star formation rate (SFR) estimators which are used in the
different wavelength regimes. We find that extinction corrected Halpha
underestimates the SFR, and the degree of this underestimation increases with
the infrared luminosity of the galaxies. Galaxies with very different levels of
dust extinction as measured with SFR(IR)/SFR(Halpha, uncorrected for
extinction) present a similar attenuation A[Halpha], as if the Balmer lines
probed a different region of the galaxy than the one responsible for the bulk
of the IR luminosity for large SFRs. In addition, SFR estimates derived from
[OII]3727 match very well those inferred from Halpha after applying the
metallicity correction derived from local galaxies. SFRs estimated from the UV
luminosities show a dichotomic behavior, similar to that previously reported by
other authors in galaxies at z <~ 0.4. Here we extend this result up to z ~
0.8. Finally, one of the studied objects is a luminous compact galaxy (LCG)
that may be suffering similar dust-enshrouded star formation episodes. These
results highlight the relevance of quantifying the actual L(IR) of LCGs, as

Monte Carlo reconstruction is simply that inflation is driven by a single
scalar field. We also require a very mild slow roll constraint, which can be
made arbitrarily weak since Monte Carlo reconstruction is implemented at
arbitrary order in the slow roll expansion. While our method cannot evade
fundamental limits on the accuracy of reconstruction, it can be simply and
consistently applied to poor data sets, and it takes advantage of the attractor
properties of single-field inflation models to constrain the potential outside
the small region directly probed by observations. We show examples of Monte
Carlo reconstruction for data sets similar to that expected from the Planck
satellite, and for a hypothetical measurement with a factor of five better

pronounced lopsided shape. The emitting regions differ considerably between the
two galaxies. Whereas FCC207 has only one central emission region, FCC046 also
contains fainter emission regions. Based on broad-band colours, its disturbed
shape and its very bright nucleus, FCC046 is akin to the class of amorphous
dwarfs. The central emission regions of both galaxies are resolved and we

explained as photo-ionisation by post-AGB stars in an old population. Some of
the emission regions in FCC046 are resolved and have diameters of the order of
50-150 pc and H$\alpha$ luminosities of the order of 10^30 W, comparable to

a strong correspondence between the radial and azimuthal profiles of the radio,
X-ray, Halpha, and infrared emission in different locations around the remnant
although there is no single, global pattern. Spectral tomography shows that the
flat- and steep-spectrum radio emissions have distinct structures. The
flat-spectrum radio emission is found either at a larger radius than or
coincident with the steep-spectrum emission. We interpret these spectral
components as tracing forward- and reverse-shocked material, respectively. The
Halpha and IR images are very similar. Their leading edges are coincident and
are either in front of or coincident with the leading edges of the X-ray and
radio emission. The X-ray emission matches the Halpha and IR emission in
places, and in other places traces the steep-spectrum radio emission. In the
north there is also an anticorrelation in the azimuthal profiles around the
remnant of the flat-spectrum radio emission and the thermal X-ray, Halpha, and
IR emissions. We suggest that this could be due to a relative weakening of the
particle acceleration at the forward shock due to Alfven wave damping in

in models where the dark energy density is a discrete variable, or where it is

$p_D=-\rho_D$ with a very high accuracy. It is also predicted that the dark
energy density is greater than the currently favored value $\Omega_D\approx
0.7$. Another prediction, which may be testable with an improved understanding
of galactic properties, is that the conditions for civilizations to emerge
arise mostly in galaxies completing their formation at low redshift, $z\approx
1$. Finally, there is a prediction which may not be easy to test

alpha). The light curve shows a conspicuous premaximum halt lasting at least
for 24 d, and a late-phase flare-like maximum. The nova then started rapidly
fading at a rate corresponding to t2 = 15 +/- 3 d. Long premaximum halts have
been considered as a unique character of the ""slowest"" novae. The present
observation, however, suggests that the long premaximum halts are not a unique
character of the slowest novae, but a more general phenomenon spreading over a
wider range of nova speed classes than has been previously believed. A recent
interpretation of premaximum halts requires that the conditions of
thermonuclear runaway was only marginally satisfied. Since such conditions are
more difficult to meet in rapidly evolving novae, V463 Sct would provide an
unique opportunity in testing this interpretation. The early post-outburst
spectrum showed co-existence of Fe II lines and some forbidden lines, which
suggests that substantial amount of material may have been ejected before the
observed optical maximum. The impact of the modern global network (VSNET) on
confirmatory processes of transient objects is briefly discussed.

flare duty cycles as a function of their luminosities. We find that very strong

Flares like the one detected by Chandra [Log$(L_X/L_{bol})=-$4.1] have a duty
cycle of about 6%, which is lower than the radio flare duty cycle ($\sim$13%).

gravitational energy is released in the hot corona and the rest is released in
the ESD. The energy equation of the ESD is dominated by advection and the
spectrum shows a broad ``hump'' caused by saturated Comptonization with
monochromatic luminosity given by $\nu L_{\nu}\propto \nu^0$. This relationship
enables us to estimate the black hole mass from the ESD luminosity. The
spectrum of the hot corona is sensitive to the parameter $f\dotM$ and the
viscosity and shows a Comptonized power-law with a high-energy cutoff. The
model is used to explain the spectral properties of narrow line Seyfert 1

like NLS1 RE J1034+396. Our spectral estimate of the black hole mass in this

reververation mapping correlation. We also examine the Eddington ratios in a

different stellar populations independent on their metallicity. We present
barium, europium and magnesium abundances for the new sample of stars. The
results are based on NLTE line formation obtained in differential model
atmosphere analyses of high resolution spectra observed mainly using the UVES
spectrogragh at the VLT of ESO. We confirm the overabundance of Eu relative to
Mg in the halo stars. Eight halo stars show the [Eu/Mg] ratios between 0.23 and
0.41, whereas stars in the thick and thin disk display a solar Eu to Mg ratio.
The [Eu/Ba] values found in the thick disk stars to lie between 0.35 and 0.57
suggest that during the thick disk formation evolved low-mass stars started to
enrich the interstellar gas by s-nuclei of Ba, and the s-process contribution
to Ba varies from 30% to 50%. Based on these results, and using the chemical
evolution calculations by Travaglio et al. (1999), we estimate that the thick
disk stellar population formed on a timescale from 1.1 to 1.6 Gyr from the
beginning of the protogalactic collapse. In the halo stars the [Eu/Ba] ratios
are found mostly between 0.40 and 0.67, which suggests a duration of the halo
formation of about 1.5 Gyr. For the whole sample of stars we present the

explanation. Our data indicate that, generally, the ratio of the total to
selective absorption, R_VI, is much smaller toward the Galactic bulge than the
value corresponding to the standard extinction curve (R_V=3.1). However, R_VI
varies from one line-of-sight to another.
  Our results explain why the red clump and RR Lyr stars in the Baade's window
dereddened with standard value of R_VI are redder compared to those of the
local population.

the immediate presupernova stage. The ``quiet merger'' case does not lead to
significant changes in composition, and the star remains a red supergiant. In
the case of a ``moderate merger'', the star may become a blue supergiant and
end its evolution as a blue supergiant, depending on the core to total mass
ratio (as may be appropriate for the progenitor of SN 1987A). In the case of
the most effective ``explosive merger'', the merger product stays a red giant.
In last two cases, the He abundance in the envelope is increased drastically,
but significant s-processing is mainly expected in the ``explosive merger''
case.

different sizes, we clarify the finite size effect. We find that the system has
a very low density of disclinations compared to that for dislocations and
fraction of points in grain boundaries. We also measure the speed distributions

The constitutive part of the stress transmission equations couples the stress
directly to the local rotational disorder of the cellular structure via a new

field can be determined in terms of the microstructure alone independent of
stress-strain information. This redefines the problem of structure-property

how DLS can be extended to a deformed Poincar\'e symmetry (DPS), and what can

in highly complex, yet deterministic ways. A slight perturbation of the system,
though, will cause the evolution to diverge from its original behavior
increasingly with time. This divergence can be measured by the fidelity, which
is defined as the squared overlap of the two time evolved states. For chaotic
systems, two main decay regimes of either Gaussian or exponential behavior have
been identified depending on the strength of the perturbation. For perturbation
strengths intermediate between the two regimes, the fidelity displays both
forms of decay. By applying a complementary combination of random matrix and
semiclassical theory, a uniform approximation can be derived that covers the
full range of perturbation strengths. The time dependence is entirely fixed by
the density of states and the so-called transition parameter, which can be
related to the phase space volume of the system and the classical action
diffusion constant, respectively. The accuracy of the approximations are
illustrated with the standard map.

and consistency checks of the values of all the critical exponents. These
results lend strong support to the conjecture that the onset of STI in
deterministic models belongs to the DP universality class.

heterogeneous expectations. Two types of players are considered: boundedly
rational and naive expectations. In this study we show that the dynamics of the
duopoly game with players whose beliefs are heterogeneous, may become
complicated. The model gives more complex chaotic and unpredictable
trajectories as a consequence of increasing the speed of adjustment of
boundedly rational player. The equilibrium points and local stability of the
duopoly game are investigated. As some parameters of the model are varied, the
stability of the Nash equilibrium point is lost and the complex (periodic or
chaotic) behavior occurs. Numerical simulations is presented to show that
players with heterogeneous beliefs make the duopoly game behaves chaotically.
Also we get the fractal dimension of the chaotic attractor of our map which is
equivalent to the dimension of Henon map.

recoil detector. The data cover photon energies ranging from 200 MeV to 400 MeV

allowed direct comparison of free and quasi-free scattering from the proton.
The neutron detection efficiency of the SENECA detector was measured via the
reaction $p(\gamma,\pi^+ n)$. The ""free"" proton Compton scattering cross
sections extracted from the bound proton data are in reasonable agreement with
those for the free proton which gives confidence in the method to extract the
differential cross section for free scattering from quasi-free data.
Differential cross sections on the free neutron have been extracted and the

obtained to be $\alpha-\beta= 9.8\pm 3.6(stat){}^{2.1}_1.1(syst)\pm 2.2(model)$

Spectroscopy on the muonium atom, the bound state of a positve muon and an

precise values of important fundamental constants. A search for spontaneous
muonium to antimuonium conversion test lepton flavour conservation and yields
most stringent limits on parameters in several speculative models. The muon
magnetic anomaly may contain hints to new physics and is a relevant calibration
point for numerous models beyond standard theory. Since most precision
experiments are limited by the particle fluxes at present muon sources,
possibilities in this field are shown which will emerge at upgraded present
facilities or new accelerator complexes under construction or planning. At such
places novel techniques would be enabled.

represent experimental data. The model consists of two levels (folded and
unfolded states) separated by an intermediate barrier. We compute the
probability distribution for the dissipated work and give analytical
expressions for the average and variance of the distribution. To first order,
the amount of dissipated work is directly proportional to the rate of
application of force (the loading rate), and to the relaxation time of the
molecule. The model yields estimates for parameters that characterize the
unfolding kinetics under force in agreement with those obtained in recent
experimental results (Liphardt, J., et al. (2002) {\em Science}, {\bf 296}

experiments needed to obtain an equilibrium free energy, to within $k_BT$, from
non-equilibrium experiments using the Jarzynski formula. The number of
irreversible experiments grows exponentially with the ratio of the average
dissipated work, $\bar{\Wdis}$, to $k_BT$.}
