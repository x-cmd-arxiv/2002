young open clusters, IC 348, $\sigma$ Orionis and Pleiades, as derived using
the data from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) catalogue which has a
limiting magnitude of K_s ~ 15, and the latest version of the Guide Star
Catalogue (GSC) which has a limiting magnitude of F ~ 21 where F refers to the
POSS II IIIa-F passband. Based on recent evolutionary models for low mass
stars, we have formulated the selection criteria for stars with masses below
0.5 solar mass. Using a statistical approach to correct for the background
contamination, we derive the mass function of objects with masses ranging from
0.5 solar mass down to the substellar domain, well below the Hydrogen Burning
Mass Limit. The lowest mass bins in our analysis are 0.025, 0.045 and 0.055
solar masses for IC 348, sigma Orionis and Pleiades, respectively. The
resultant slopes of the mass functions are 0.8 +/- 0.2 for IC 348, 1.2 +/- 0.2
for sigma Orionis and 0.5 +/- 0.2 for Pleiades, which are consistent with the
previous results. The contribution of objects below 0.5 solar mass to the total
mass of the cluster is ~40%, and the contribution of objects below 0.08 solar
mass to the total mass is ~4%.

such deep mixing may have important repercussions on our understanding of these

increases the amount of matter that needs to be accreted by the stars with
respect with the standard models by some three orders of magnitude. It is also
shown that significantly larger accretion rates have to be maintained, as high
as $10^{-11}$~M$_\sun yr^{-1}$, to prevent meridional circulation from
canceling the effect of accretion. The existence of old ($\approx 1$~Gyr) is

standard picture, the cores are envisioned to condense out of strongly
magnetized clouds through ambipolar diffusion. Most previous calculations based
on this scenario are limited to axisymmetric cloud evolution leading to a
single core, which collapses to form an isolated star or stellar system at the
center. These calculations are here extended to the nonaxisymmetric case under
thin-disk approximation, which allows for a detailed investigation into the
process of fragmentation, fundamental to binary, multiple system, and cluster
formation. We have shown previously that initially axisymmetric, magnetically
subcritical clouds with an $m=2$ density perturbation of modest fractional
amplitude ($\sim 5%$) can develop highly elongated bars, which facilitate
binary and multiple system formation. In this paper, we show that in the
presence of higher order ($m\ge 3$) perturbations of similar amplitude such
clouds are capable of breaking up into a set of discrete dense cores. These
multiple cores are magnetically supercritical. They are expected to collapse
into single stars or stellar systems individually and, collectively, to form a
small stellar group. Our calculations demonstrate that the standard scenario
for single star formation involving magnetically subcritical clouds and
ambipolar diffusion can readily produce more than one star, provided that the
cloud mass is well above the Jeans limit and relatively uniformly distributed.
The fragments develop in the central part of the cloud, after the region has
become magnetically supercritical but before rapid collapse sets in. It is
enhanced by the flattening of mass distribution along the field lines and by
the magnetic tension force.

use of this relationship can still be useful for those stellar systems showing
an intrinsic metallicity spread, since in this case the metallicity effect has
a negligible effect on the final distance modulus estimate. We compare the
adopted semiempirical relationship with the fully empirical one recently

appling the semiempirical period - blue amplitude - V-band luminosity relation,

very hard pulsed X-ray emission up to ~10 keV and a likely detection of
high-energy gamma-rays (> 100 MeV) with a soft spectrum. The relative phasing
of the X-ray and gamma-ray profiles, however, was unknown. A recently performed
Chandra (0.08-10 keV) observation of PSR J0218+4232 settled the phasing down to
0.2 millisecond, and shows that the X-ray pulses are aligned with the gamma-ray
pulses providing supporting evidence for our first detection of high-energy
gamma-rays from this source. The preliminary results from a recent RXTE (2-250
keV) observation (27-12-2001 -- 7-01-2002) show significant pulsed emission, in
a complex profile, up to ~20 keV. The composite high-energy spectrum of this
millisecond pulsar is similar to the canonical spectrum of Unidentified
Gamma-ray Sources (UGS), making fast (<3-4 ms) millisecond pulsars with low
characteristic ages (<10^8 years) good candidates for an UGS association and
challenging targets for INTEGRAL observations.

approximation, are presently used to filter out the acoustic modes when
computing low frequency modes of a star (gravity modes or inertial modes). In a
precedent paper (Dintrans & Rieutord 2001), we observed that the anelastic
approximation gave eigenfrequencies much closer to the exact ones than the
subseismic approximation. Here, we try to clarify this behaviour and show that
it is due to the different physical approach taken by each approximation: On
the one hand, the subseismic approximation considers the low frequency part of
the spectrum of (say) gravity modes and turns out to be valid only in the
central region of a star; on the other hand, the anelastic approximation
considers the Brunt-Vaisala frequency as asymptotically small and makes no
assumption on the order of the modes. Both approximations fail to describe the
modes in the surface layers but eigenmodes issued from the anelastic
approximation are closer to those including acoustic effects than their
subseismic equivalent.
  We conclude that, as far as stellar eigenvalue problems are concerned, the
anelastic approximation is better suited for simplifying the eigenvalue problem
when low-frequency modes of a star are considered, while the subseismic
approximation is a useful concept when analytic solutions of high order
low-frequency modes are needed in the central region of a star.

the spiral arms of the Galaxy. We offer possible explanations for this effect,
in particular that the density gradient away from spiral arms, combined with
the many generations of sequential star formation required to create large
shells, could lead to a preferential placement of shells on the trailing edges
of spiral arms. Spiral density wave theory is used in order to derive the
magnitude of the density gradient behind spiral arms. We find that the density
gradient away from spiral arms is comparable to that out of the Galactic plane
and therefore suggest that this may lead to exaggerated shell expansion away
from spiral arms and into interarm regions.

application to the LDS north of dec= -28 deg. and the HIPASS data south of

these objects are more likely to represent a single phenomenon in a similar
evolutionary state than would a sample which included any of the major HVC
complexes. Five principal observables are defined for the CHVC population: (1)
the spatial deployment of the objects on the sky, (2) the kinematic
distribution, (3) the number distribution of observed HI column densities, (4)
the number distribution of angular sizes, and (5) the number distribution of
line widths. We show that the spatial and kinematic deployments of the ensemble
of CHVCs contain various clues regarding their characteristic distance. These
clues are not compatible with a location of the ensemble within the Galaxy
proper. The deployments resemble in several regards those of the Local Group
galaxies. We describe a model testing the hypothesis that the CHVCs are a Local
Group population. The agreement of the model with the data is judged by
extracting the observables from simulations, in a manner consistent with the
sensitivities of the observations and explicitly taking account of Galactic
obscuration. We show that models in which the CHVCs are the HI counterparts of
dark-matter halos evolving in the Local Group potential provide a good match to
the observables, if account is taken of tidal and ram--pressure disruption, the
consequences of obscuration due to Galactic HI and of differing sensitivities
and selection effects pertaining to the surveys.

that these systems generally exhibit a strong temperature decline at outer
radii. In our best case, NGC3268, this corresponds to a flattening of the
entropy profile at a level of ~400 keV cm^2. This value is high compared both
to the observed entropy floor of ~100 keV cm^2 and to the expected value from
gravitational heating. We suggest that the observed entropy profile in most
groups at densities exceeding 500 times the critical is purely driven by
non-gravitational heating processes. After comparison with a larger sample of
groups and clusters, we conclude that there is a variation in the level of
non-gravitational heating between ~100 keV cm^2 and ~400 keV cm^2 within every
system. Using models of cluster formation as a reference frame, we established
that the accreted gas reaches an entropy level of 400 keV cm^2 by redshift
2.0-2.5, while such high entropies where not present at redshifts higher than
2.8-3.5, favoring nearly instantaneous preheating. Adopting galactic winds as a
source of preheating, and scaling the released energy by the observed metal
abundance, the variation in the preheating could be ascribed mostly to
variation in the typical overdensity of the energy injection, ~30 for an
entropy floor (100 keV cm^2) and to ~5 for an entropy of 400 keV cm^2.

many of the found cluster pairs and groups can be expected statistically due to
chance superposition on the plane of the sky. We found that, depending on the
cluster density, between 56% (bar region) and 12% (outer LMC) of the detected
pairs can be explained statistically. We studied in detail the properties of
the multiple cluster candidates. The binary cluster candidates seem to show a
tendency to form with components of similar size. When possible, we studied the
age structure of the cluster groups and found that the multiple clusters are
predominantly young with only a few cluster groups older than 300 Myr. The
spatial distribution of the cluster pairs and groups coincides with the
distribution of clusters in general; however, old groups or groups with large
internal age differences are mainly located in the densely populated bar
region. Thus, they can easily be explained as chance superpositions. Our
findings show that a formation scenario through tidal capture is not only
unlikely due to the low probability of close encounters of star clusters, and
thus the even lower probability of tidal capture, but the few groups with large
internal age differences can easily be explained with projection effects. We
favour a formation scenario as suggested by Fujimoto & Kumai (1997) in which
the components of a binary cluster formed together and thus should be coeval or
have small age differences compatible with cluster formation time scales.

synchronization distance, within which a vehicle always tries to adjust its
speed to the one of the vehicle in front. In the CA models presented, the
modelling of the free and safe speeds, the slow-to-start rules as well as some
contributions to noise are based on the ideas of the Nagel-Schreckenberg type
modelling. It is shown that the proposed CA models can be very transparent and
still reproduce the two main types of congested patterns (the general pattern
and the synchronized flow pattern) as well as their dependence on the flows
near an on-ramp, in qualitative agreement with the recently developed continuum
version of the three-phase traffic theory [B. S. Kerner and S. L. Klenov. 2002.

rate on the road upstream of the on-ramp is investigated. The capacity drops at

in-plane fields, with the point contacts biased to transmit only a single spin
(g < e^2/h), the voltage across the collector depends on the spin polarization
of the current incident on it. Spin polarizations of greater than 80% are found
for both emitter and collector at 300mK and 7T in-plane field.

are derived from Hamiltonian dynamics. These equations contain memory terms and
are time-reversal invariant. In contrast the phenomenological Langevin
equations have no memory terms (they are Markovian equations) and give a time
evolution split in two branches (semigroups), each of which breaks time
symmetry. A standard approach to bridge dynamics with phenomenology is to
consider the Markovian approximation of the former. In this paper we present a
formulation in terms of {\it dressed} particles, which gives exact Markovian
equations. We formulate dressed particles for Poincar\'e nonintegrable systems,
through an invertible transformation operator $\Lam$ introduced by Prigogine
and collaborators. $\Lam$ is obtained by an extension of the canonical
(unitary) transformation operator $U$ that eliminates interactions for
integrable systems. Our extension is based on the removal of divergences due to
Poincar\'e resonances, which breaks time-symmetry. The unitarity of $U$ is
extended to ``star-unitarity'' for $\Lam$. We show that $\Lam$-transformed
variables have the same time evolution as stochastic variables obeying Langevin
equations, and that $\Lam$-transformed distribution functions satisfy exact
Fokker-Planck equations. The effects of Gaussian white noise are obtained by
the non-distributive property of $\Lam$ with respect to products of dynamical
variables. Therefore our method leads to a direct link between dynamics of
Poincar\'e nonintegrable systems, probability and stochasticity.

with hyperbolic space sections is also considered. Special emphasis is placed
on the late-time behaviour where several interesting properties of the Weyl
curvature invariant occur. The late-time behaviour is classified into five
distinctive categories. It is found that for a large class of models, the
generic late-time behaviour the Weyl curvature invariant is to dominate the
Ricci invariant at late times. This behaviour occurs in universe models which
have future attractors that are plane-wave spacetimes, for which all scalar
curvature invariants vanish. The overall behaviour of the Weyl curvature
invariant is discussed in relation to the proposal that some function of the

at temperature T as a function of two variables: phi, the angle associated with
a non-trivial Polyakov loop, and H, a constant background chromomagnetic field.
Using techniques broadly applicable to finite temperature field theories, we
develop both low and high temperature expansions. At low temperatures, the real
part of the effective potential V_R indicates a rich phase structure, with a
discontinuous alternation between confined (phi=pi) and deconfined phases
(phi=0). The background field H moves slowly upward from its zero-temperature
value as T increases, in such a way that sqrt(gH)/(pi T) is approximately an
integer. Beyond a certain temperature on the order of sqrt(gH), the deconfined
phase is always preferred. At high temperatures, where asymptotic freedom
applies, the deconfined phase phi=0 is always preferred, and sqrt(gH) is of
order g^2(T)T. The imaginary part of the effective potential is non-zero at the
global minimum of V_R for all temperatures. A non-perturbative magnetic
screening mass of the form M_m = cg^2(T)T with a sufficiently large coefficient
c removes this instability at high temperature, leading to a stable
high-temperature phase with phi=0 and H=0, characteristic of a

condition that the dimension of W/C_1(W) is less than infinity, where C_1(W) is
the subspace of W spanned by elements of the form u_{-1}w for u in V of
positive weight and w in W, then matrix elements of products and iterates of
intertwining operators satisfy certain systems of differential equations.
Moreover, for prescribed singular points, there exist such systems of
differential equations such that the prescribed singular points are regular.
The finiteness of the fusion rules is an immediate consequence of a result used
to establish the existence of such systems. Using these systems of differential
equations and some additional reducibility conditions, we prove that products
of intertwining operators for V satisfy the convergence and extension property
needed in the tensor product theory for V-modules. Consequently, when a vertex
operator algebra V satisfies all the conditions mentioned above, we obtain a
natural structure of vertex tensor category (consequently braided tensor
category) on the category of V-modules and a natural structure of intertwining

When there is only one pole, or two poles in the unit ball, it turns out to be
equal to the Lempert function defined from analytic disks into $\Omega$ by $L_S
(z) :=\inf \{\sum^N_{j=1}\nu_j\log|\zeta_j|: \exists \phi\in \mathcal
{O}(\mathbb D,\Omega), \phi(0)=z, \phi(\zeta_j)=a_j, j=1,...,N \}$. It is known
that we always have $L_S (z) \ge G_S(z)$. In the more general case where we
allow weighted poles, there is a counterexample to equality due to Carlehed and
Wiegerinck, with $\Omega$ equal to the bidisk.
  Here we exhibit a counterexample using only four distinct equally weighted
poles in the bidisk. In order to do so, we first define a more general notion
of Lempert function ""with multiplicities"", analogous to the generalized Green
functions of Lelong and Rashkovskii, then we show how in some examples this can
be realized as a limit of regular Lempert functions when the poles tend to each
other. Finally, from an example where $L_S (z) > G_S(z)$ in the case of
multiple poles, we deduce that distinct (but close enough) equally weighted
poles will provide an example of the same inequality. Open questions are
pointed out about the limits of Green and Lempert functions when poles tend to
each other.

inflatory period, the slopes of the single particle spectra increase, while the
HBT radius parameters decrease exponentially with time. This effect is shown to
be similar to the development of the homogeneity of our Universe due to an
inflatory period. Independently of the initial conditions, and the exact value
of the freeze-out time and temperature, the meausurables (single particle
spectra, the correlation functions, the slope parameters, elliptic flow, HBT
radii and cross terms) become time independent during the late, non-inflatory
stages of the expansion, and they satisfy new kind of scaling laws. If the
expansion starts with a transient inflation caused by the gluon wind, it leads
naturally to large transverse flows and the simultaneous equality and scaling
behaviour of the HBT radius parameters, R_{side} \approx R_{out} \approx
R_{long} \approx t_f \sqrt{T_f/m}. With certain relativistic corrections, the

There exists also a physical aspect of chirality which is largely being
overlooked at. Two examples of mechanical devices are introduced here that
represent ``Physical Chirality''. These are a rotating water sprinkler and a
variant of Crookes' radiometer. When interacting with appropriate media, they
both choose only one mode of rotation out of two possible ones. Such a behavior
does not obey time-reversal invariance, which is regarded to be a rule in
classical mechanics. This is due to their chiral nature. Instead, they do obey
a space-time (ST) law of invariance, that is, what is rotating in the opposite
direction is the mirror-image of the given device. In a recent experiment of
Koumura et al. they discovered a similar behavior of a molecular rotor. The
possible biological significance of physical chirality is emphasized hereby,
and the conclusion is that chiral molecular systems do not reach readily
thermal equilibrium. In other words: ``Physical chirality does feed on negative
entropy'', and therefore, it may well be of crucial value to life.

between distant measurements. To avoid such an action at a distance, EPR
concluded that Quantum Mechanics had to be incomplete. However, its extensions
involving additional ""hidden variables"", allowing for the recovery of
determinism and locality, have been disproved experimentally (Bell's theorem).
Here, I present an opposite solution of the paradox based on the greater
indeterminism of the modern Quantum Field Theory (QFT) description of Particle
Physics, that prevents the preparation of any state having a definite number of
particles. The resulting uncertainty in photons radiation has interesting
consequences in Quantum Information Theory (e.g. cryptography and
teleportation). Moreover, since it allows for less elements of EPR physical
reality than the old non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics, QFT satisfies the EPR
condition of completeness without the need of hidden variables. The residual
physical reality does never violate locality, thus the unique objective proof
of ""quantum nonlocality"" is removed in an interpretation-independent way. On
the other hand, the supposed nonlocality of the EPR correlations turns out to
be a problem of the interpretation of the theory. If we do not rely on hidden
variables or new physics beyond QFT, the unique viable interpretation is a
minimal statistical one, that preserves locality and Lorentz symmetry.

distribution for resonance scattering to the exponential time dependence for
decaying states. However, to apply the Fourier transform, one has to bend the
rules of standard quantum mechanics; the Lorentzian energy distribution must be
extended to the full real axis $-\infty<E<\infty$ instead of being bounded from
below $0\leq E <\infty$ (``Fermi's approximation''). Then the Fourier transform
of the extended Lorentzian becomes the exponential, but only for times $t\geq
0$, a time asymmetry which is in conflict with the unitary group time evolution
of standard quantum mechanics. Extending the Fourier transform from
distributions to generalized vectors, we are led to Gamow kets, which possess a
Lorentzian energy distribution with $-\infty<E<\infty$ and have exponential
time evolution for $t\geq t_0 =0$ only. This leads to probability predictions
that do not violate causality.
