improved positional information, we present and analyse new optical, near-IR

the submm-selected sources in those fields. As many as 15% of the submm sources
detected at 1.4 GHz are resolved by the 1.4'' beam and a further 25% have more
than one radio counterpart, suggesting that radio and submm emission arise from
extended starbursts and that interactions are common. We note that less than a
quarter of the submm-selected sample would have been recovered by targeting
optically faint radio sources, underlining the selective nature of such
surveys. At least 60% of the radio-confirmed optical/IR host galaxies appear to
be morphologically distorted; many are composite systems - red galaxies with
relatively blue companions; just over half are found to be very red or
extremely red; contrary to popular belief, most are sufficiently bright to be
tackled with spectrographs on 8-m telescopes. We estimate the median redshift
of the S(850um) ~ 8 mJy submm galaxy population: if the radio/far-IR
correlation holds at high redshift, and our sample is unbiased, we derive a
conservative median z >= 2.0, or >= 2.4 using spectral templates more

measured with two different telescopes, even though the photometry is reduced
to the same local standards around the supernova using the specific color terms

spectrophotometry of SN 1999ee to derive magnitude corrections (S-corrections)

characterizing the instrumental system before great photometric accuracies of
Type Ia supernovae can be claimed. It also shows that this effect can have
important astrophysical consequences since a small systematic shift of 0.02 mag
in the B-V color can introduce a 0.08 mag error in the extinction corrected
peak B magnitudes of a supernova and thus lead to biased cosmological

measure accurately the cluster velocity dispersion to be 1016 (+126/-93) km/s.
The distribution of velocity offsets is consistent with a Gaussian, indicating
no substantial velocity substructure. As previously noted for other
optically-selected clusters at redshifts of z > 0.5, a comparison between the
X-ray luminosity (L_x) and the velocity dispersion (sigma) of Cl 1324+3011
implies that this cluster is underluminous in X-rays by a factor of ~3 - 40

clusters. We also examine the morphologies of those cluster members which have
available high-angular-resolution imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST). There are 22 spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members within the HST
field-of-view. Twelve of these are visually classified as early-type

that observed in nearby rich clusters. Confirming previous cluster studies, the
results for cluster Cl 1324+3011, combined with morphological studies of other
massive clusters at redshifts less than z = 1, suggest that the galaxy
population in massive clusters is strongly evolving with redshift. This
evolution implies that early-type galaxies are forming out of the excess of
late-type (spiral, irregular, and peculiar) galaxies over the ~7 Gyr timescale.

new X-ray data allow us to separate the synchrotron emission of the pulsar wind

Based on X-ray data from two epochs, we observe temporal variation of the
location of X-ray hot spots near the pulsar, indicating relativistic motion. We
compare thermal emission observed within the shell, which may be associated
with the forward shock of the pulsar wind nebula, to thermal emission from a
nearby portion of the remnant shell, the temperature of which implies an
expansion velocity consistent with the identification of the remnant with the
historical event of 386 A.D. The measured X-ray and radio spectral indices of
the nebula synchrotron emission are found to be consistent with a single

anomalously large given the apparent size and age of the nebula if a spherical

vicinity of the deployment site the ANTARES collaboration has performed a
series of in-situ measurements to study the change in light transmission
through glass surfaces during immersions of several months. The average loss of
light transmission is estimated to be only ~2% at the equator of a glass sphere
one year after deployment. It decreases with increasing zenith angle, and tends
to saturate with time. The transmission loss, therefore, is expected to remain
small for the several year lifetime of the ANTARES detector whose optical

analysis of the ^{210}Pb activity profile in sediment cores and the study of
biofouling on glass plates. Despite a significant sedimentation rate at the

number of pairs on a=z_G/z_Q is analysed, where z_G and z_Q are the redshifts

the result of chance positional coincidences with a uniform spatial

scattering and complete redistribution. The solution is performed using an
iterative procedure, where monochromatic radiative transfer problems are
successively solved. The present implementation is applicable for arbitrary
model configurations with an optical depth up to 10^(3-4). Results of Ly-alpha
line transfer calculations for a spherically symmetric model, a disk-like
configuration, and a halo containing three source regions are discussed. We
find the characteristic double-peaked Ly-alpha line profile for all models with
an optical depth > 1. In general, the blue peak of the profile is enhanced for
models with infall motion and the red peak for models with outflow motion. Both
velocity fields produce a triangular shape in the two-dimensional Ly-alpha
spectra, whereas rotation creates a shear pattern. Frequency-resolved Ly-alpha
images may help to find the number and position of multiple Ly-alpha sources
located in a single halo. A qualitative comparison with observations of
extended Ly-alpha halos associated with high redshift galaxies shows that even

yield results which reproduce many features in the observed line profiles and

soliton exists only below a critical attractive interaction which depends on
the extent of confinement. Such a behavior is also found in multi-soliton
condensates with box boundary conditions. We obtain numerical and analytical
estimates of the critical strength beyond which the solitons do not exist. By
using an effective 1D nonpolynomial nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation (NPSE),
which accurately takes into account the transverse dynamics of cigar-like
condensates, we numerically simulate the dynamics of the ""soliton train""
reported in a recent experiment (Nature {\bf 417} 150 (2002)). Then, analyzing
the macroscopic quantum tunneling of the bright soliton on a Gaussian barrier
we find that its interference in the tunneling region is strongly suppressed
with respect to non-solitonic case; moreover, the tunneling through a barrier
breaks the solitonic nature of the matter wave. Finally, we show that the
collapse of the soliton is induced by the scattering on the barrier or by the
collision with another matter wave when the density reaches a critical value,
for which we derive an accurate analytical formula.

most singular term in terms of 1/\gamma_k^* (\gamma_k^* being the quasiparticle
damping rate). We utilize the Ward identities for the heat current which is
derived by the local energy conservation law. Based on the derived expressions,
we can calculate various thermoelectric transport coefficients within the
framework of the Baym-Kadanoff type conserving approximation. Thus, the present
expressions are very useful for studying the strongly correlated electrons such
as high-Tc superconductors, organic metals, and heavy Fermion systems, where
the current vertex corrections are expected to play important roles. By using
the derived expression, we calculate the thermal conductivity \kappa in a

the present work applies the charge state representation in the the strong
coupling case. From the discrete Hamiltonian we construct effective, truncated
PDE Hamiltonians which yield approximate, but analytical, wave functions and
energies for the ground state. The validity of the expressions is confirmed by
comparing the results against numerically obtained eigenstates and
eigenenergies, whenever possible. For uniform arrays, the results converge
rapidly and even \phi-dependence of the wave function is rather well described.
In the inhomogeneous case we find the Hamiltonian to be parametrically
renormalisable in order to obtain an accurate ground state energy. A method for
for finding an inhomogeneous trial wave function is explained. As a passing
note, we briefly examine the intertwined connection between the pumped charge

Tye in the context of string theory, but hold more generally. In particular,
they hold for standard Einstein gravity. A method based on D-dimensional
unitarity can then be used to systematically construct all quantum loop
corrections order-by-order in perturbation theory using as input the gravity
tree amplitudes expressed in terms of gauge theory ones. More generally, the
unitarity method provides a means for perturbatively quantizing massless
gravity theories without the usual formal apparatus associated with the
quantization of constrained systems. As one application, this method was used
to demonstrate that maximally supersymmetric gravity is less divergent in the
ultraviolet than previously thought.

virtual photon production plane which is not power-law suppressed in the
Drell-Yan scaling limit. The origin of the single-spin asymmetry in $\pi
p^\uparrow \to \ell^+ \ell^- X$ is a phase difference between two amplitudes
coupling the proton target with $J^z_p = \pm {1\over 2}$ to the same
final-state, the same amplitudes which are necessary to produce a nonzero
proton anomalous magnetic moment. The calculation requires the overlap of
target light-front wavefunctions differing by one unit of orbital angular
momentum projection $L_z;$ thus the SSA in the Drell-Yan reaction provides a
direct measure of orbital angular momentum in the QCD bound state. The
single-spin asymmetry predicted for the Drell-Yan process $\pi p^\uparrow \to

of the properties of hadronic fireballs made in heavy ion collisions. Their

hadronization conditions. The resonance's short lifetime makes them ideal
probes of the fireball chemical freeze-out mechanisms. An analysis of resonance
abundance in heavy ion collisions should be capable of distinguishing between
possible hadronization scenarios, in particular between sudden and gradual
hadronization. In this paper, we review the existing SPS and RHIC experimental
data on resonance production in heavy ion collisions, and discuss in terms of
both thermal and microscopic models the yields of the two observed resonances,
K* and Lambda(1520). We show how freeze-out properties, namely chemical
freeze-out temperature and the lifetime of the interacting hadron phase which
follows, can be related to resonance yields. Finally, we apply these methods to
SPS and RHIC measurements, discuss the significance and interpretations of our
findings, and suggest further measurements which may help in clarifying
existing ambiguities.

For Majorana fermions, the single-particle Dirac Hamiltonian as a differential

transition condition can satisfy all three. When calculating sums over
zero-point energies by mode number regularization, this gives a new rationale

conditions is equivalent to a field redefinition in the effective action. In
this sense, the quantum deformation of conformal symmetry in the N = 4 super
Yang-Mills theory, which was computed in 't Hooft gauge in hep-th/9808039 and
hep-th/0203236, is gauge dependent. The deformation is an intrinsic property of
the theory in that it cannot be eliminated by a local choice of gauge (although
we sketch a field redefinition induced by a nonlocal gauge which, on the
Coulomb branch of the theory, converts the one-loop quantum-corrected conformal
transformations to the classical ones). We explicitly compute the deformed
conformal symmetry in R_\xi gauge. The conformal transformation law of the
gauge field turns out to be \xi-independent. We construct the scalar field
redefinition which relates the 't Hooft and R_\xi gauge results. A unique
feature of 't Hooft gauge is that it makes it possible to consistently truncate
the one-loop conformal deformation to the terms of first order in derivatives
of the fields such that the corresponding transformations form a field
realization of the conformal algebra.

cylinder of circumference $L$ submitted to a perpendicular magnetic field of
strength $B$ and to the potential of impurities of maximal amplitude $w$. This
model is of importance in the context of the integer quantum Hall effect. In
the regime of strong magnetic field or weak disorder $B>>w$ it is known that
there are chiral edge states, which are localised within a few magnetic lengths
close to, and extended along the boundary of the cylinder, and whose energy
levels lie in the gaps of the bulk system. These energy levels have a spectral
flow, uniform in $L$, as a function of a magnetic flux which threads the
cylinder along its axis. Through a detailed study of this spectral flow we
prove that the spacing between two consecutive levels of edge states is bounded
below by $2\pi\alpha L^{-1}$ with $\alpha>0$, independent of $L$, and of the
configuration of impurities. This implies that the level repulsion of the
chiral edge states is much stronger than that of extended states in the usual
Anderson model and their statistics cannot obey one of the Gaussian ensembles.
Our analysis uses the notion of relative index between two projections and
indicates that the level repulsion is connected to topological aspects of
quantum Hall systems.

$<{p_{T}}>$ of protons and antiprotons is significantly larger than in p--p
collisions at the same center of mass energy. Its scaling with the number of
participant nucleons, an increase of $20 \pm 5%$ from peripheral to central,
may be due to radial expansion. In a hydrodynamical picture a simultaneous fit
of pions, kaons and protons is consistent with a radial flow velocity of
$\beta_{\rm{Tsurface}} = 0.72 \pm 0.01$ and a temperature of $T = 122 \pm 4$

of a quantum particle with a square potential barrier becomes independent of
the barrier width in a range of barrier thickness. This is the Hartman effect,
which has been frequently associated with ``superluminality''. A fundamental
limitation on the effect is set by non-relativistic ``causality conditions''.
We demonstrate first that the causality conditions impose more restrictive
bounds on the negative time delays (time advancements) when no bound states are
present. These restrictive bounds are in agreement with a naive, and generally
false, causality argument based on the positivity of the ``extrapolated phase
time'', one of the quantities proposed to characterize the duration of the
barrier's traversal. Nevertheless, square wells may in fact lead to much larger
advancements than square barriers. We point out that close to thresholds of new
bound states the time advancement increases considerably, while, at the same
time, the transmission probability is large, which facilitates the possible
observation of the enhanced time advancement.
