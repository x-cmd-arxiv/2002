Both the A and B images show variations, but with substantial differences in

The structure functions for the A and B images are quite different, with image
A more than twice as variable as image B (a factor of 4 in structure function)

small amplitude of the fluctuations is due to the finite size of the source

from the turbulence theory, suggesting back reaction of the particle
acceleration. The fitting procedure constraints the amplitude of the turbulent

varying. The accreted gas might be first prevented to flow inwards to the
center by the bar gravity torques, which maintains it to the outer Lindblad
resonance. While the first bar is weakening, the accreted gas replenishes the
disk, increasing the disk-to-bulge ratio, and the disk self-gravity. A second
bar is then unstable, with a higher pattern speed, due both to the increased
mass, and shorter bar length. Three or four bar episodes have been followed
over a Hubble time. Their strength is decreasing with time, while their pattern
speed is increasing. Detailed balance of the angular momentum transfer and
evolution can account for these processes. The gas recycled through star
formation, and rejected through stellar mass loss plays also a role in the disk
dynamics. Implications on the spiral galaxy dynamics and evolution along the

analytically in the asymptotic limit of high incident Mach number M_1. The flow
is unstable with respect to radial perturbations as expected by Nakayama
(1993), due to post-shock acceleration. Its growth time scales like the
advection time from the shock r_sh to the sonic point r_son. The growth rate of
non-radial perturbations l=1 is higher by a factor M_1^{2/3}, and is therefore
intermediate between the advection and acoustic frequencies. Besides these
instabilities based on post-shock acceleration, our study revealed another
generic mechanism based on the cycle of acoustic and vortical perturbations
between the shock and the sonic radius, independently of the sign of post-shock
acceleration. The vortical-acoustic instability is fundamentally non-radial. It
is fed by the efficient excitation of vorticity waves by the isothermal shock
perturbed by acoustic waves. The growth rate exceeds the advection rate by a
factor log M_1. Unstable modes cover a wide range of frequencies from the
fundamental acoustic frequency ~c/r_sh up to a cut-off ~c/r_son associated with
the sonic radius. The highest growth rate is reached for l=1 modes near the
cut-off. The additional cycle of acoustic waves between the shock and the sonic
radius is responsible for variations of the growth rate by a factor up to 3
depending on its phase relative to the vortical-acoustic cycle. The instability
also exists, with a similar growth rate, below the fundamental acoustic
frequency down to the advection frequency, as vorticity waves are efficiently
coupled to the region of pseudosound. These results open new perspectives to
address the stability of shocked accretion flows.

binary showing fast orbital motion. From the confirmed members we determine the
heliocentric velocity of the cluster as -58.7 +- 0.2 km/s. The total
line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the cluster stars is 1.1 +- 0.2 km/s (all

lowest velocity dispersion that has so far been measured for a stellar system

point-like topological defects, global monopoles. By taking into account
self-gravity,the qualitative feature of the global monopole solutions depends
on the vacuum expectation value v of the scalar field. When v < sqrt{1 / 8 pi},
there are global monopole solutions which have a deficit solid angle defined at
infinity. When sqrt{1 / 8 pi} <= v < sqrt{3 / 8 pi}, there are global monopole
solutions with the cosmological horizon, which we call the supermassive global
monopole. When v >= sqrt{3 / 8 pi}, there is no nontrivial solution. It was
shown that all of these solutions are stable against the spherical
perturbations. In addition to the global monopole solutions, the de Sitter
solutions exist for any value of v. They are stable against the spherical
perturbations when v <= sqrt{3 / 8 pi}, while unstable for v > sqrt{3 / 8 pi}.
We study polar perturbations of these solutions and find that all
self-gravitating global monopoles are stable even against polar perturbations,
independently of the existence of the cosmological horizon, while the de Sitter

for laboratory gamma's of order 1 GeV incident on a target pi at rest. The pion

The k-supersymmetry variation against which it is invariant is obtained from
the bulk supersymmetries by means of a projector that has a simple expression
in terms of the auxiliary fields. The distinctive feature of our formalism is
that all fermion fields are hidden into the definition of the curvatures and
the action is formally the same, in terms of these differential forms as it
would be in a purely bosonic theory. Typically our new formulation enables one
to discuss the correct boundary actions for non trivial supergravity Dp-brane

g=1, or K_C>0, g>=2 is well known, and corresponds to the familiar trichotomy
of spherical, Euclidean and hyperbolic non-Euclidean plane geometry.
Classification aims to treat all projective algebraic varieties in terms of
this trichotomy. The model is the treatment of surfaces by Castelnuovo and
Enriques around 1900. Because the canonical class of a variety may not have a
definite sign, we usually have to modify a variety by a minimal model program
(MMP) before it makes sense to apply the trichotomy; this involves
contractions, flips and fibre space decompositions. The classification of
3-folds was achieved by Mori and others during the 1980s. New results over the
last 5 years have added many layers of subtlety to higher dimensional
classification. These include:
  -> extension of MMP to dimension 4 (Shokurov),
  -> rational connected varieties (Campana and Koll\'ar--Miyaoka--Mori),
  -> explicit classification results for 3-folds (Corti, Kawakita and others),
  -> Calabi-Yaus, mirror symmetry and string theory applications,
  -> resolution of orbifolds and McKay correspondence,
  -> the derived category as a characteristic of varieties (Bondal, Orlov,
Bridgeland and others),
  -> birational rigidity (Sarkisov, Corti, Pukhlikov and others).
  The study of 3-folds also yields a rich crop of applications in several
different branches of algebra, geometry and theoretical physics. My lecture
surveys some of these topics.

in P^5. The curve of degenerate quadrics has degree 6 and defines a double
covering of P^2 K3 surface Y ramified in this curve. This is a classical
example of a correspondence between K3 surfaces which is related with moduli of
vector bundles on K3 studied by Mukai. When general (for fixed Picard lattices)
X and Y are isomorphic? We give necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of
Picard lattices of X and Y.
  E.g. for Picard number 2, the Picard lattice of X and Y is defined by its
determinant (-d) where d>0, d\equiv 1 \mod 8, and one of equations a^2-db^2=8
or a^2-db^2=-8 should have an integral solution (a,b). The set of these d is
infinite: d\in {(a^2\mp 8)/b^2} where a and b are odd integers. This describes
all possible divisorial conditions on 19- dimensional moduli of intersections
of three quadrics in P^5 when Y\cong X. One of them when X has a line is
classical, and corresponds to d=17.

$\frac{1}{d}\tbinom{2(d-1)}{d-1}$, while for the dual problems the lower bound

when G is just a set. For example, if $\lambda=(n-t,1,...,1)$, then a
$\lambda$-transitive group is the same as a t-transitive permutation group and
if $\lambda=(n-t,t)$, then we recover the t-homogeneous permutation groups.

free particles and antiparticles with mass m>0 and arbitrary spin s>0, in the
framework of the Poincare group P(1,3), there exist three types of
nonequivalent equations. In the present paper we study the P, T, C properties
of these equations.

quantum computers and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm are derived in virtual spin

allowing the required properties for quantum processor implementation if for
qubit encoding virtual spin representation is used. Four dimensional Hilbert
space of nuclear spin 3/2 is considered in details for this aim

A 66 (2002) 053405","10.1103/PhysRevA.66.053405",,"quant-ph",,"  The paper studies Bloch oscillations of cold neutral atoms in the optical
lattice. The effect of spontaneous emission on the dynamics of the system is
analyzed both analytically and numerically. The spontaneous emission is shown
to cause (i) the decay of Bloch oscillations with the decrement given by the
rate of spontaneous emission and (ii) the diffusive spreading of the atoms with
a diffusion coefficient depending on {\em both} the rate of spontaneous
emission and the Bloch frequency.
