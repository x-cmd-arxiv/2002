visible only in the quiescent VRI light curves, is due to ellipsoidal
variability of the red giant component. Our simple light curve analysis, by
fitting of the Fourier cosine series, resulted in a self-consistent
phenomenological model of YY Her, in which the periodic changes can be
described by a combination of the ellipsoidal changes and a sinusoidal changes
of the nebular continuum and line emission.

suppressed there. The HCN-to-CO integrated intensity ratio on the brightness
temperature scale, R_{HCN/CO}, is about 0.02 within the central r < 400 pc

of 5 - 15. These molecular gas properties would explain why NGC 5195 is in a
post-starburst phase; most of the dense molecular cores (i.e., the very sites
of massive star formation) have been consumed away by a past starburst event,
and therefore a burst of massive star formation can no longer last, although a
large amount of low density gas still exists. We propose that dense molecular
gas can not be formed from remaining diffuse molecular gas because the
molecular gas in the center of NGC 5195 is too stable to form dense cores via
gravitational instabilities of diffuse molecular gas.

burst parameters, observed in a sample of 156 GRBs belonging to BATSE 4B
catalog with T90 less than 2 s. The number of subpulses in a burst is strongly
correlated not only with the object's duration but also with its fluence and
hardness ratio, suggesting that when the central engine is more powerful,
ejecting matter with typically higher values of Lorentz factor, the bulk energy
is dissipated on longer time scales in the form of larger number of gamma
pulses. We estimate hard-to-soft lag in bursts by taking the difference between
centroids corresponding to time profiles at energies $> 100$ keV and $<100$
keV. The number of short GRBs that show soft-to-hard spectral evolution is
slightly over one quarter of the total, in the sample considered here. Bursts
that exhibit hard-to-soft spectral change appear to form a distinct class, with
strength as well as hardness of individual subpeaks tending to decrease with
peak position. Opposite is true for objects with softer photons arriving
earlier than the harder ones, implying some kind of a rejuvenation of the
central engine (may be due to enhanced accretion of matter towards the end).
The two classes also show other diverging trends. For instance, objects
belonging to the larger of the two classes display strong correlations between
spectral lag and the fluence, the hardness ratio as well as the number of
pulse, respectively. While no such correlations are seen in bursts that evolve
from soft to hard. However, the magnitude of lag is strongly correlated with
burst duration in both the classes.

histories along the color-magnitude relation, and therefore confirm a pure
metallicity interpretation for its origin, with an early (z~5) formation epoch

revealed numerous bright off-center point sources which, if isotropic emitters,
are likely to be intermediate-mass black holes, with hundreds to thousands of
solar masses. The origin of these objects is under debate, but observations
suggest that a significant number of them currently reside in young
high-density stellar clusters. There is also growing evidence that some
Galactic globular clusters harbor black holes of similar mass, from
observations of stellar kinematics. In such high-density stellar environments,
the interactions of intermediate-mass black holes are promising sources of
gravitational waves for ground-based and space-based detectors. Here we explore
the signal strengths of binaries containing intermediate-mass black holes or
stellar-mass black holes in dense stellar clusters. We estimate that a few to
tens per year of these objects will be detectable during the last phase of
their inspiral with the advanced LIGO detector, and up to tens per year will be
seen during merger, depending on the spins of the black holes. We also find
that if these objects reside in globular clusters then tens of sources will be
detectable with LISA from the Galactic globular system in a five year
integration, and similar numbers will be detectable from more distant galaxies.
The signal strength depends on the eccentricity distribution, but we show that
there is promise for strong detection of pericenter precession and
Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital plane. We conclude by discussing what
could be learned about binaries, dense stellar systems, and strong gravity if
such signals are detected.

Simultaneous photometric observations yielded the bolometric fluxes. The

velocities across the Bubble complex are compatible with its retrograde
rotation and drift, which are characteristic for solitary vortices known in

Weigelt et al. 2002). The high-resolution images obtained over the last 5.4
years revealed the dynamic evolution of the subarcsecond dusty environment of
IRC+10216 and our recent time-independent 2D radiative transfer modeling
reconstructed its physical properties at the single epoch of January 1997
(Men'shchikov et al. 2001). Having documented the complex changes in the
innermost bipolar shell of the carbon star, we incorporate the evolutionary
constraints into our new modeling to understand the physical reasons for the
observed changes. The new calculations imply that during the last 50 years, we
have been witnessing an episode of a steadily increasing mass loss from the
central star, from Mdot ~ 10^-5 Msun/yr to the rate of Mdot ~ 3x10^-4 Msun/yr
in 2001. The rapid increase of the mass loss of IRC+10216 and continuing
time-dependent dust formation and destruction caused the observed displacement
of the initially faint components C and D and of the bright cavity A from the
star which has almost disappeared in our images in 2001. Increasing dust
optical depths are causing strong backwarming that leads to higher temperatures
in the dust formation zone, displacing the latter outward with a velocity v_T ~
27 km/s due to the evaporation of the recently formed dust grains. This shift
of the dust density peak in the bipolar shell mimics a rapid radial expansion,
whereas the actual outflow has probably a lower speed v < v_inf ~ 15 km/s. The
model predicts that the star will remain obscured until Mdot starts to drop
back to lower values in the dust formation zone.

of the electron-electron interaction and the transverse magnetic field on

system in the absence of the magnetic field identifies the source of the
fluctuations, interplay of disorder and interaction, and effects of hopping.
Revealed in sufficiently clean samples with strong interactions is an unusual
right-biased distribution of the inverse compressibility, which is neither of
the Gaussian nor of the Wigner-Dyson type. While in most cases weak magnetic
fields tend to suppress fluctuations, in relatively clean samples with weak
interactions fluctuations are found to grow with the magnetic field. This is
attributed to the localization properties of the electron states, which may be
measured by the participation ratio and the inverse participation number. It is
also observed that at the frustration where the Fermi level is degenerate,
localization or modulation of electrons is enhanced, raising fluctuations.
Strong frustration in general suppresses effects of the interaction on the
inverse compressibility and on the configuration of electrons.

model stabilizes topological textures which are formed together with domains of
disoriented chiral condensate (DCC) during the roll-down phase. The classically
evolving field acts as source for the emission of pions and $\sigma$ mesons.
The exponents of power laws for the growth of angular correlations and for
emission rates are extracted. Fluctuations in the abundance ratios for neutral

signature for the chiral phase transition after heavy-ion collisions. It is
found that the presence of stabilizing textures (baryons and antibaryons)
prevents sufficiently rapid growth of DCC-domain size, so observability of
anomalous tails in the abundance ratios is unlikely. However, the transient
formation of growing DCC domains causes sizable broadening of the distributions

(Sections 6-14) we discuss the role of the U(1) axial symmetry for the phase
structure of QCD at finite temperature. One expects that, above a certain
critical temperature, also the U(1) axial symmetry will be restored. We will
try to see if this transition has (or has not) anything to do with the usual
chiral transition: various possible scenarios are discussed. In particular, we
analyse a scenario in which the U(1) axial symmetry is still broken above the
chiral transition. We will show that this scenario can be consistently
reproduced in the full respect of the relevant QCD Ward Identities and also
using an effective Lagrangian model. A new order parameter is introduced for

a unitary chiral approach. The one-loop pion-pion scattering amplitude in
Chiral Perturbation Theory at finite temperature is unitarized via the Inverse

rho-pion-pion coupling increases. The rho behavior seems to be favored by

spin-2 supermultiplets with N = k supersymmetries k = 1,2,3,4. Such multiplets
contain 2k particles with spin-3/2, so there must exist N = 2k local
supersymmetries in the full nonlinear theories spontaneously broken so that
only N = k global supersymmetries remain unbroken. In this paper we unhide
these hidden supersymmetries by using gauge invariant formulation for massive
high spin particles. Such formulation, operating with the right set of physical
degrees of freedom from the very beginning and having non-singular massless
limit, turns out to be very well suited for construction of massive
supermultiplets from the well known massless ones. For all four cases
considered we have managed to show that the massless limit of the
supertransformations for N = k massive supermultiplet could be uplifted to N =
2k supersymmetry. This, in turn, allows one to investigate which extended
supergravity models such massive multiplets could arise from. Our results show
a clear connection of possible models with the five-dimensional extended
supergravities.

$U_{ls}(0,k_{f0})\simeq 35$ MeVfm$^2$ in perfect agreement with the empirical
value used in the shell model. This novel spin-orbit strength is neither of
relativistic nor of short range origin. The potential $V_{ls}$ underlying the
empirical spin-orbit strength $\widetilde U_{ls}= V_{ls} r_{ls}^2$ becomes a
rather weak one, $V_{ls}\simeq 17$ MeV, after the identification $r_{ls}=

strong $p$-dependence of $U_{ls}(p,k_{f0})$ leading even to a sign change above

which go beyond the usual shell model parametrization leave questions about the
ultimate relevance of the spin-orbit interaction generated by $2\pi$-exchange

has to be taken as arbitrary ideosyncrasies in formulation. It is shown that
minor changes result in internally consistent variations of both Quantum
Mechanics and Special Relativity devoid of these phenomena. The
reinterpretation of some experiments though to confirm the existence of
non-locality and asymmetric aging is briefly considered and a possible test is
proposed.

to two different players, Alice and Bob, randomly. Alice receives one of the
three cards, and Bob receives the remaining two cards. We find that Bob could
know better than Alice does on guessing Alice's card, no matter what Bob
chooses to measure his two cards collectively or separately. We also find that
Bob's best strategy for guessing Alice's card is to measure his two cards
collectively.

It has been conjectured that one may realize all probability distributions that
are majorized by the vector of eigenvalues of the density matrix. We show that
if the states in the ensemble are assumed to be distinct then it is not true,
but a marginally weaker statement may still be true.

thereby establishing a general connection between squeezing and the
entanglement that is attainable by non-squeezing operations. Special attention
is devoted to general two-mode Gaussian states, for which we provide the
optimal entangling procedure, present an explicit formula for the attainable
degree of entanglement measured in terms of the logarithmic negativity, and
discuss several practically important special cases.
