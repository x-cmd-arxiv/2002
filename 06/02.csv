simulations. Although we can not resolve individual clusters in our simulation,
we assume that they form in collapsing molecular clouds when the local external
gas pressure exceeds 10$^5$ $k_B$ (where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant).
Several simulations are carried out for a range of initial conditions and
galaxy mass ratios. The input model spirals are given a halo globular cluster
system similar to those observed for the Milky Way and M31. Gravitational tidal
effects during galaxy merging and interaction leads to a dramatic increase in
gas pressure, which exceeds our threshold and hence triggers new globular
cluster formation. We investigate the properties of the globular cluster system
in the remnant galaxy, such as number density, specific frequency, kinematic
properties and metallicity distribution. Different orbital conditions and mass
ratios give rise to a range in globular cluster properties, particularly for
the interaction models. Our key results are the following: The newly formed
metal-rich clusters are concentrated at the centre of the merger remnant
elliptical, whereas the metal-poor ones are distributed to the outer parts due
to strong angular momentum transfer. (abridged version)
