comparing its predictions with exact results from numerical simulations of
nonlinear gravitational clustering. We then present several astrophysical

we described in Drinkwater et al (2002b) and labelled `Ultra-Compact Dwarfs'
(UCDs). A major result is that the conventional dwarfs all have scale-sizes>3
arcsec (abut 300 pc). This apparent minimum scale size implies an equivalent
minimum luminosity for a dwarf of a given surface brightness. This produces a
limit on their distribution in the magnitude-surface brightness plane, such
that we do not observe dEs with high surface brightnesses but faint absolute
magnitudes. Above this observed minimum scale-size of 3 arcsec, the dEs and
dS0s fill the whole area of the magnitude-surface brightness plane sampled by
our selection limits. The observed correlation between magnitude and surface
brightness noted by several recent studies of brighter galaxies is not seen
with our fainter cluster sample. A comparison of our results with the Fornax

Grid for the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM). SIM depends on the astrometric
stability of about 2000 stars, the so called Grid, against which the science
measures are referenced. Low metallicity, and thus relatively high luminosity K
giants are shown to be the population of choice, when available. The
alternative, nearby G dwarfs, are shown to be suseptable to unmodeled motions
induced by gas-giant planetary companions, should there be a significant
population of such companions.
  Radial velocity filtering is quite efficient in selecting Grid members from
the K giants with yields exceeding 50% if filtering at 30m/s (1-sigma) is
available. However if the binary fraction of the G dwarfs approaches 100% as
some studies suggest, the yield of stable systems would be in the range of 15%
at best (with 10m/s filtering). Use of the initial SIM measurement as a final
filter is shown not to be critical in either case, although it could improve
the yield of stable grid members.
  For a Grid composed of weak-lined K giants, the residual contamination by
large unmodeled motions will amount to about 3% (and rises to about 6% if a
60m/s radial velocity criterion is used). The selective introduction of
quadratic terms in the proper motion solutions during the post-mission phase of
data reduction can reduce contamination to a remarkable 1% or better in either
case.
  Analytic estimates based on circular orbits are developed which show how
these results come about.

longest observation period available at hard X-ray energies. Flux variations by
a factor of 4 have been detected over 4years, whereas less than 30% flux
variations have been observed for individual flares on time-scales of 3 days.
Two temporal methods, the power spectrum density (PSD) and the structure
function (SF), have been used to study the variability characteristics of
3C273. The hard X-ray photon spectra generally show a power-law shape with a
differential photon index of G = 1.6+-0.1. In 10 of 261 data segments,
exceptions to power-law behaviour have been found: (i) an additional soft
excess below 4keV, and (ii) a broad Fe fluorescent line feature with EW =
100-200 eV. Our new observations of these previously reported X-ray features
may imply that 3C273 is a unique object whose hard X-ray emission occasionally
contains a component which is not related to a beamed emission (Seyfert like),
but most hard X-rays are likely to originate in inverse Compton radiation from
the relativistic jet (blazar like). Multi-frequency spectra from radio to
gamma-ray are presented in addition to our RXTE results. The X-ray time
variability and spectral evolution are discussed in the framework of beamed,

five-dimensional equations for a {\em fixed} brane and use the brane-world
paradigm to determine the fundamental parameters in the theory, which are the
vacuum energy $\sigma$, the gravitational coupling $G$ and the cosmological
term $\Lambda_{(4)}$. We present specific models where these physical
quantities are variable functions of time. Different scenarios are possible but
we discuss with some detail a model for which $\dot{G}/G \sim H$ and
$\Lambda_{(4)} \sim H^2$, which seems to be favored by observations. Our
results are not in contradiction to previous ones in the literature. In
particular, to those where the brane is described as a domain wall moving in a
static $Sch-AdS$ bulk. Indeed these latter models in RS scenarios describe the
same spacetime as other solutions (with fixed brane) in gaussian coordinates

spectrum is reproduced reasonably well within the non-relativistic boundstate
theory based on perturbative QCD. In that calculation, however, the fine
splittings and the S-P level splittings are predicted to be considerably
narrower than the corresponding experimental values. We investigate the
bottomonium spectrum within a specific framework based on perturbative QCD,
which incorporates all the corrections up to O(alpha_S^5 m_b) and O(alpha_S^4
m_b), respectively, in the computations of the fine splittings and the S-P
splittings. We find that the agreement with the experimental data for the fine
splittings improves drastically due to an enhancement of the wave functions
close to the origin as compared to the Coulomb wave functions. The agreement of
the S-P splittings with the experimental data also becomes better. We find that
natural scales of the fine splittings and the S-P splittings are larger than
those of the boundstates themselves. On the other hand, the predictions of the
level spacings between consecutive principal quantum numbers depend rather
strongly on the scale mu of the operator \propto C_A/(m_b r^2). The agreement
of the whole spectrum with the experimental data is much better than the
previous predictions when mu \simeq 3-4 GeV for alpha_S(M_Z)=0.1181. There
seems to be a phenomenological preference for some suppression mechanism for

consider absolute minimizers of the energy, but, in a sense, we look for local
minimizers which are sufficiently close to the approximate solution obtained in
the previous step. This is done by introducing in the variational problem an
additional term which penalizes the $L^2$-distance between the approximate
solutions at two consecutive times. We study the continuous-time version of
this model, obtained by passing to the limit as the time step tends to zero,
and show that it satisfies (for almost every time) some minimality conditions
which are slightly different from those considered in Francfort and Marigo and
in our previous paper, but are still enough to prove (under suitable regularity
assumptions on the crack path) that the classical Griffith's criterion holds at
the crack tips. We prove also that, if no initial crack is present and if the
data of the problem are sufficiently smooth, no crack will develop in this
model, provided the penalization term is large enough.

the basis of a model which takes into account the production of hadrons due to
the breaking of the color string and to gluon radiation. It is shown that the
details of the propagation of the partonic system in the nuclear environment
can be thoroughly investigated by the semi-inclusive process A(e,e'(A-1))X, in
which the scattered lepton is detected in coincidence with the nucleus (A-1) in
low energy and momentum states. The rescattering of the struck nucleon debris
with the medium damps and distorts the momentum distributions of (A-1) in a way
which is very sensitive to the details of effective cross section of the
debris.
  The total cross section of the process on ^4He, ^16O, and ^40Ca, related to
the probability that after a target nucleon experiences a DIS process, the
recoiling (A-1) nucleus remains intact, is evaluated, and the distorted

that both quantities are very sensitive to the details of the early stage of
