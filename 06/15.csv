Pleiades stars, including spectra previously analysed by Russell (1996). We
report a 0.7 dex scatter in the abundances from 6708A, and a scatter at least
as large from the 6104A line. We find a reasonable correllation between the
6104A and 6708A Li abundances, although four stars have 6104A-determined
abundances which are significantly larger than the 6708-determined values, by
up to 0.5 dex, suggesting problems with the homogeneous, one-dimensional
atmospheres being used. We show that these discrepancies can be explained,
although probably not uniquely, by the presence of star spots with plausible
coverage fractions. The addition of spots does not significantly reduce the
apparent scatter in Li abundances, leaving open the possibility that at least
some of the spread is caused by real star-to-star differences in pre-main-
sequence Li depletion.

the low density and low metallicity gas of Magellanic Bridge (MB). Toward
DI1388, the FUSE observations show molecular hydrogen, O VI, and numerous other
atomic or ionic transitions in absorption, implying the presence of multiple
gas phases in a complex arrangement. The relative abundance pattern in the MB
is attributed to varying degrees of depletion onto dust similar to that of halo
clouds. The N/O ratio is near solar, much higher than N/O in damped Ly-alpha
systems, implying subsequent stellar processing to explain the origin of
nitrogen in the MB. The diffuse molecular cloud in this direction has a low
column density and low molecular fraction. H2 is observed in both the
Magellanic Stream and the MB, yet massive stars form only in the MB, implying
significantly different physical processes between them. In the MB some of the
H2 could have been pulled out from the SMC via tidal interaction, but some also
could have formed in situ in dense clouds where star formation might have taken
place. Toward DGIK975, the presence of neutral, weakly and highly ionized
species suggest that this sight line has also several complex gas phases. The
highly ionized species of O VI, C IV, and Si IV toward both stars have very
broad features, indicating that multiple components of hot gas at different
velocities are present. Several sources (a combination of turbulent mixing
layer, conductive heating, and cooling flows) may be contributing to the
production of the highly ionized gas in the MB. Finally, this study has
confirmed previous results that the high-velocity cloud HVC 291.5-41.2+80 is
mainly ionized composed of weakly and highly ions. The high ion ratios are
consistent with a radiatively cooling gas in a fountain flow model.

of the black hole binary, Cyg X-1. The H-alpha profiles consist of (1) a P
Cygni component associated with the wind of the supergiant, (2) emission
components that attain high velocity at the conjunctions and that probably form
in enhanced outflows both towards and away from the black hole, and (3) an
emission component that moves in anti-phase with the supergiant's motion. We
argue that the third component forms in accreted gas near the black hole, and
the radial velocity curve of the emission is consistent with a mass ratio of
M_X / M_opt = 0.36 +/- 0.05. We find that there is a general anti-correlation
between the H-alpha emission strength and X-ray flux in the sense that when the
H-alpha emission is strong (W_\lambda < -0.5 Angstroms) the X-ray flux is
weaker and the spectrum harder. On the other hand, there is no correlation
between H-alpha emission strength and X-ray flux when H-alpha is weak. During
the low/hard X-ray state, the strong wind is fast and the accretion rate is
relatively low, while in the high/soft state the weaker, highly ionized wind
attains only a moderate velocity and the accretion rate increases. We argue
that the X-ray transitions from the normal low/hard to the rare high/soft state
are triggered by episodes of decreased mass loss rate in the supergiant donor
star.

h$_{0.5}^{-1}$ kpc), is elongated from northwest (NW) to southeast (SE), as is
the X-ray surface brightness distribution on much larger scales ($\sim$ 2
h$_{0.5}^{-1}$ Mpc). The ridge is cooler than its western and southern
surroundings while the differences from its eastern and northern surroundings
are small. We also searched for small-scale structures with sizes $\sim$
arcmin. Nine extended features, with sizes from $\sim$ 0.5$'$ to 1.5$'$, were
detected at significance levels above 4 $\sigma$. Five of the nine features are
located in the ridge and form local crests. The nine extended features can be
divided into two types. Those associated with galaxies (NGC 3860B, NGC 3860 and
UGC 6697) are significantly cooler than their surroundings (0.3 - 0.9 keV vs. 3
- 4.5 keV). The masses of their host galaxies are sufficient to bind the
extended gas. These extended features are probably related to thermal halos or
galactic superwinds of their host galaxies. The existence of these relatively
cold halos imply that galaxy coronae can survive in cluster environment (e.g.,
Vikhlinin et al. 2001). Features of the second type are not apparently
associated with galaxies. Their temperatures may not be significantly different
from those of their surroundings. This class of extended features may be
related to the ridge. We consider several possibilities for the ridge and the
second type of extended features. The merging scenario is preferred.

arises mainly from preserving the location of the peaks in the angular power
spectrum. This `horizon-angle degeneracy' is considered in some detail and
shown to follow a simple relation Omega_m h^{3.4} = constant. Adding the 2dFGRS
power spectrum constrains Omega_m h and breaks the degeneracy. If tensor
anisotropies are assumed to be negligible, we obtain values for the Hubble
constant h=0.665 +/- 0.047, the matter density Omega_m=0.313 +/- 0.055, and the
physical CDM and baryon densities Omega_c h^2 = 0.115 +/- 0.009, Omega_b h^2 =

up to the point where the clusters are nearly completely dissolved. Our main
focus is on the post-collapse evolution of these clusters. We find that after
core collapse, isolated clusters evolve along nearly a single sequence of
models whose properties are independent of the initial density profile and
particle number. Due to the slower expansion of high-N clusters, relaxation
times become almost independent of the particle number after several core
collapse times, at least for the particle range of our study. As a result, the
dissolution times of isolated clusters exhibit a surprisingly weak dependence
on N.
  We find that most stars escape due to encounters between single stars inside
the half-mass radius of the cluster. Encounters with binaries take place mostly
in the cluster core and account for roughly 15% of all escapers. Encounters
between single stars at intermediate radii are also responsible for the build
up of a radial anisotropic velocity distribution in the halo. For clusters
undergoing core oscillations, escape due to binary stars is efficient only when
the cluster center is in a contracted phase. Our simulations show that it takes
about 10^5 N-body time units until the global anisotropy reaches its maximum
value. The anisotropy increases with particle number and it seems conceivable
that isolated star clusters become vulnerable to radial orbit instabilities for
large enough N. However, no indication for the onset of such instabilities was
seen in our runs.

The low temperature phase consists of a staggered order parameter of
circulating currents, while the disordered high temperature phase is a
power-law phase with no order. A special feature of this transition is the
complete lack of an observable specific heat anomaly at the transition. There
is also a transition at a even higher temperature at which the magnitude of the
order parameter collapses. These results are due to classical thermal
fluctuations and are entirely unrelated to a quantum critical point in the
ground state. The quantum mechanical ground state can be explored by
incorporating processes that causes transitions between the vertices, allowing
us to discuss quantum phase transition in the ground state as well as the
effect of quantum criticality at a finite temperature as distinct from the
power-law fluctuations in the classical regime. A generalization of the model
on a triangular lattice that leads to a 20-vertex model may shed light on the
Wigner glass picture of the metal-insulator transition in two-dimensional
electron gas. The power-law ordered high temperature phase may be generic to a
class of constrained systems and its relation to recent advances in the quantum

different implementations of the Laplacian gauge are defined and compared. The
Laplacian gauge propagator has already been claimed to be insensitive to finite
volume effects and this is tested on lattices with large volumes.

the cross section by 50-100% compared to the non-supersymmetric two Higgs

combined and all the homologous sites from the various species are used as a
block, clustering becomes feasible. We predict 50-100 new regulons as well as
many new members of existing regulons, potentially doubling the number of known
regulatory sites in E. coli.

"quant-ph/0206099","Karl-Erik Eriksson","Karl-Erik Eriksson","Measurement as soft final-state interaction with a stochastic system","19 pages, v2 email address added",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A small quantum scattering system (the microsystem) is studied in interaction
with a large quantum system (the macrosystem) described by unknown stochastic
variables. The interaction between the two systems is diagonal for the
microsystem in a certain basis, and it leads to an imprint on the macrosystem.
Moreover, the interaction is assumed to involve only small transfers of energy
and momentum between the two systems (as compared to typical energies/momenta
within the microsystem). This makes it suitable to carry out the analysis in
scattering theory, where the transition amplitude for the whole system
factorizes. The interaction taking place within the macrosystem is assumed to
depend on the stochastic variables in such a way that, on the average, no
particular channel is favoured. The result is then, in the thermodynamic limit
of the macrosystem, that the whole system bifurcates and the microsystem ends
up in a state described by one of the basis vectors (in the mentioned basis).
The macrosystem ends up in an entangled state tied to this basis vector. For
the ensemble of macrosystems, the interaction with the microsystem leads, on
the average, to the usual decoherence and diagonal density matrix for the
microsystem. The macrosystem can be interpreted as representing a measurement
device for performing a measurement on the microsystem. The whole discussion is
carried out within quantum mechanics itself without any modification or
generalization.

spectra for spin lattice systems. These algorithms are based on the efficient
calculation of the discrete Fourier components of the density of states. The
efficiency of these algorithms in calculating the free energy per spin of
general spin lattices to bounded error is examined. We find that the number of
Fourier components required to bound the error in the free energy due to the
broadening of the density of states scales polynomially with the number of
spins in the lattice. However, the precision with which the Fourier components
must be calculated is found to be an exponential function of the system size.
