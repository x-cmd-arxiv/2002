  Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In earlier papers (Roshi & Anantharamaiah 2000, 2001a), we presented
extensive surveys (angular resolution -- 2\deg $\times$ 2\deg & 2\deg $\times$
6\arcmin) of radio recombination lines (RRLs) near 327 MHz in the longitude
range $l = $ 332\deg $\to$ 89\deg using the Ooty Radio Telescope. These surveys
have detected carbon lines mostly between $l = $ 358\deg $\to$ 20\deg and in a
few positions at other longitudes. This paper presents the observed carbon line
parameters in the high-resolution survey and a study of the galactic
distribution and angular extent of the line emission observed in the surveys.
The carbon lines detected in the surveys arise in ``diffuse'' \CII regions. The
\lv diagram and radial distribution constructed from our carbon line data shows
similarity with that obtained from hydrogen recombination lines at 3 cm from
\HII regions indicating that the distribution of the diffuse \CII regions in
the inner Galaxy resembles the distribution of the star-forming regions. We
estimated the [CII] 158 micron emission from diffuse \CII regions and find that
upto 95 % of the total observed [CII] 158 micron emission can arise in diffuse
\CII regions if the temperature of the latter $\sim 80$ K. Our high-resolution
survey data shows that the carbon line emitting regions have structures on
angular scale $\sim$ 6\arcmin. Analysis of the dual-resolution observations
toward a 2\deg wide field centered at $l = $ 13\deg.9 and toward the longitude
range $l = $ 1\deg.75 to 6\deg.75 shows the presence of narrow ($\Delta V \le $
15 \kms) carbon line emitting regions extending over several degrees in $l$ and
$b$. The physical size perpendicular to the line-of-sight of an individual
diffuse \CII region in these directions is $>$ 200 pc.

with the CO emission line velocities observed along its major axis. In the
present paper, we confirm the validity of that model by showing that it can
also reproduce the CO velocities observed off the major axis - a much more
robust test. The CO observations, however, tend to span a wider range of
velocities than a direct application of the original model of Berman would
suggest. This situation can be improved significantly if the molecular disk is
made thicker, a requirement already encountered in dynamical simulations of
other spiral galaxies, and typically attributed to a broadening of the
molecular layer in galactic fountain-like processes. In the central regions of
M31, however, it is unclear whether there actually is a thick molecular disk,
or whether broadening the molecular layer is merely an artificial theoretical
means of accounting for some disk warping. Other effects not included in the
model, such as hydraulic jumps, might also contribute to a widening of the

of our code where the reacceleration term comes from standard minimal
reacceleration models. The goal of this paper is to present a general view of
the evolution of the goodness of fit to B/C data with the propagation

in accordance with our previous study, a Kolmogorov-like power spectrum for
diffusion is strongly disfavored. Rather, the $\chi^2$ analysis points towards
$\delta\gtrsim 0.7$ along with source spectra index $\lesssim 2.0$. Two
distinct energy dependences are used for the source spectra: the usual
power-law in rigidity and a law modified at low energy, the second choice being
only slightly preferred. We also show that the results are not much affected by
a different choice for the diffusion scheme. Finally, we compare our findings
to recent works, using other propagation models. This study will be further
refined in a companion paper, focusing on the fluxes of cosmic ray nuclei.

properties to T90 are presented and show the power law relationships between
the median values of the 4 pulse timing properties and T90, but also that the
power laws depend in a consistent manner on the number of pulses per GRB. The
timing diagrams are caused by the correlated properties of the pulses in the
burst and can be explained by a combination of factors including the Doppler
boost factor Gamma, a viewing effect caused by a jet and different progenitors.
GRBs with similar values of T90 have a wide range in the number of pulses. GRBs
with the large number of short and spectrally hard pulses may occur either from
a homogeneous jet with a higher average value of Gamma or close to the axis of
an inhomogeneous jet with higher values of Gamma near the rotation axis. The
less luminous GRBs with fewer pulses may originate further from the axis of the
inhomogeneous jet. The pulses in GRBs have six distinctive statistical
properties including correlations between time intervals, correlations between
pulse amplitudes, an anticorrelation between pulse amplitudes and time
intervals, and a link to intermittency in GRS 1915+105. The timing diagrams and
correlated pulses suggest that GRBs are powered by accretion processes

order to place the first reliable constraints on the rate of such outbursts in
the Universe and test the stellar tidal disruption hypothesis, we have
performed a systematic and complete survey for them by cross-correlating ROSAT
All-Sky Survey (RASS) and pointed PSPC data. We have detected five galaxies
that were in outburst during the RASS, three of which show no signs of nuclear
activity; these objects had been reported on individually in previous studies.
After making reasonable corrections for the complicated selection effects, we
conclude that the rate of large-amplitude X-ray outbursts from inactive

rate is consistent with the predicted rate of stellar tidal disruption events
in such galaxies. When only the two active galaxies are considered, we find a

approximated by power-laws of the form dN(L)/dL ~ L^alpha, with slopes in the

brighter magnitude intervals, although direct hints of a variation in the LF

with the mean star formation rate per unit area, Sigma(SFR). Assuming that the

normalized by K-band flux densities as indicators of recent star formation, we
find several trends. First, star formation activity is stronger in late-type
(Sc - Scd) spirals than in early-type (Sa - Sab) spirals. This trend is seen
both in nuclear and disk activity. These results confirm several previous
optical studies of star formation along the Hubble sequence but conflict with
the conclusions of most of the previous studies using IRAS data, and we discuss
why this might be so. Second, star formation is significantly more extended in
later-type spirals than in early-type spirals. We suggest that these trends in
star formation are a result of differences in the gas content and its
distribution along the Hubble sequence, and it is these differences that
promote star formation in late-type spiral galaxies. We also search for trends
in nuclear star formation related to the presence of a bar or nuclear activity.
The nuclear star formation activity is not significantly different between
barred and unbarred galaxies. We do find that star formation activity appears
to be inhibited in LINERs and transition objects compared to HII galaxies. The
mean star formation rate in the sample is 1.4 Msun/yr based on global
far-infrared fluxes. Combining these data with CO data gives a mean gas
consumption time of 6.4 x 10^8 yr, which is ~5 times lower than the values

using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Early Data Release (SDSS EDR). Using the
Minimal Spanning Tree technique we have extracted sets of filaments, of
wall-like structures, of galaxy groups, and of rich clusters from this unique
sample. The physical properties of these structures were then measured and
compared with the expectations from Zel'dovich' theory.
  The measured characteristics of galaxy walls were found to be consistent with
those for a spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with
$\Omega_m\approx$ 0.3 and $\Omega_\Lambda \approx$ 0.7, and for Gaussian
initial perturbations with a Harrison -- Zel'dovich power spectrum.
Furthermore, we found that the mass functions of groups and of unrelaxed
structure elements generally fit well with the expectations from Zel'dovich'
theory, although there was some discrepancy for lower mass groups which may be
due to incompleteness in the selected sample of groups. We also note that both
groups and rich clusters tend to prefer the environments of walls, which tend
to be of higher density, rather than the environments of filaments, which tend
to be of lower density.
  Finally, we note evidence of systematic differences in the properties of the
LSS between the Northern Galactic Cap stripe and the Southern Galactic Cap
stripe -- in particular, in the physical properties of the walls, their spatial
distribution, and the relative numbers of clusters embedded in walls. Because
the mean separation of walls is $\approx$ 60 -- 70$h^{-1}$ Mpc, each stripe
only intersects a few tens of walls. Thus, small number statistics and cosmic
variance are the likely drivers of these systematic differences.

curve that increases linearly from the first data point, at 300 pc, up to to

dark halo with a flat density core. The optical region of this galaxy is
dominated by a homogeneous halo of costant density of ~ 10^{-24} g/cm^3 and a
size of ~3 kpc, about twice that of the stellar disk. This result is a
formidable case of the inability of standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter scenario
to account for the dark mass distribution around galaxies, and points toward
the existence of an intriguing halo scale-length. With respect to the recent

  Our model includes viscous heating and absorption of stellar radiation. It
analytically expresses the vertical structure of the disc using a two-layer
approach: the outer layer is heated by the star and by the inner layer, and the
inner layer by visous dissipation and by the outer layer. We compare three
prescriptions for the flaring of the irradiated surface, and conclude that a
smooth profile with r ~ r^1/8->1/7 has predictions close to those of comparable
numerical models. The observables (spectra, images and visibilities) are
numerically determined.
  We study the influence of disc parameters on the structure and observables.
Then we apply it to three stars observed in IR interferometry. For T Tau and SU

could not in the case of T Tau North, which might come from caveats in the flux

73mas, resp. The total sequence of K-band observations covers now 8 epochs from
1995 to 2001 and shows the dynamic evolution of the inner dust shell. The
present observations show that the appearance of the dust shell has
considerably changed compared to the epochs of 1995 to 1998. Four main
components within a 0.2"" radius can be identified in the K-band images. The
apparent separation of the two initially brightest components A and B increased
from ~191mas in 1995 to ~351mas in 2001. Simultaneously, component B has been
fading and almost disappeared in 2000 whereas the initially faint components C
and D became brighter (relative to peak intensity). These changes can be
related to changes of the optical depth caused, e.g., by mass-loss variations
or new dust condensation in the wind. Our 2D radiative transfer model suggests
that the observed relative motion of A and B is not consistent with the known
terminal wind velocity of 15 km/s. The apparent motion with a deprojected
velocity of 19 km/s on average and of recently 27 km/s appears to be caused by
adisplacement of the dust density peak due to dust evaporation in the optically
thicker and hotter environment. Our monitoring, covering more than 3 pulsation
periods, shows that the structural variations are not related to the stellar
pulsation cycle in a simple way. This is consistent with the predictions of
hydrodynamical models that enhanced dust formation takes place on a timescale
of several pulsation periods. The timescale of the fading of component B can
well be explained by the formation of new dust in the circumstellar envelope.

doped and nondegenerate, and moderate electric fields can dominate the carrier
motion. We recently derived a drift-diffusion equation for spin polarization in
the semiconductors by consistently taking into account electric-field effects
and nondegenerate electron statistics and identified a high-field diffusive
regime which has no analogue in metals. Here spin injection from a ferromagnet
(FM) into a nonmagnetic semiconductor (NS) is extensively studied by applying
this spin drift-diffusion equation to several typical injection structures such
as FM/NS, FM/NS/FM, and FM/NS/NS structures. We find that in the high-field
regime spin injection from a ferromagnet into a semiconductor is enhanced by
several orders of magnitude. For injection structures with interfacial
barriers, the electric field further enhances spin injection considerably. In
FM/NS/FM structures high electric fields destroy the symmetry between the two
magnets at low fields, where both magnets are equally important for spin
injection, and spin injection becomes locally determined by the magnet from
which carriers flow into the semiconductor. The field-induced spin injection
enhancement should also be insensitive to the presence of a highly doped
nonmagnetic semiconductor (NS$^+$) at the FM interface, thus FM/NS$^+$/NS
structures should also manifest efficient spin injection at high fields.
Furthermore, high fields substantially reduce the magnetoresistance observable

Particular attention is paid to the experimental extraction of phase-breaking
and spin-orbit scattering times when weak anti- localization effects are
prominent. Compared with metals and low mobility semiconductors the
characteristic magnetic field $B_{tr} = \hbar/4eD \tau$ in high mobility
samples is very small and the experimental dependencies of the interference
effects extend to fields several hundreds of times larger. Fitting experimental
results under these conditions therefore requires theories valid for arbitrary
magnetic field. It was found, however, that such a theory was unable to fit the
experimental data without introducing an extra, empirical, scale factor of
about 2. Measurements in tilted magnetic fields and as a function of
temperature established that both the weak localization and the weak
anti-localization effects have the same, orbital origin. Fits to the data
confirmed that the width of the low field feature, whether a weak localization
or a weak anti-localization peak, is determined by the phase-breaking time and
also established that the universal (negative) magnetoresistance observed in
the high field limit is associated with a temperature independent spin-orbit
scattering time.

period is small (~20) one may expect a net temporary polarization within this
period that will couple via exchange interaction to the localized spin. This
coupling will randomly modulate the tunneling barrier and create a dispersion
in the tunneling current which is a product of a Larmor frequency component due
to the precession of the single spin and the dispersion of the spin of the
tunneling electrons. This noise component is spread over the whole frequency
range for random white noise spin polarization of electrons. In opposite case
the power spectrum of the spins of the tunneling electrons has a peak at zero
frequency an elevated noise in the current at omega_L will appear. We discuss
the possible source of this spin polarization. We find that for relevant values
of parameters signal to noise ratio in the spectral characteristic is 2-4 and
is comparable to the reported signal to noise ratio. The magnitude of the
current fluctuation is a relatively weak increaing function of the DC current
and the magnetic field. The linewidth produced by the back action effect of

Inclusion of backscattering becomes necessary because backscattering is the
dominant interaction process between confined identical one-dimensional

long range time correlations. The Fokker-Planck equation which models very
precisely the LWP $fluctuation$ empirical probability distributions, in

D66 (2002) 084025","10.1103/PhysRevD.66.084025",,"gr-qc astro-ph",,"  We show that NS's with large toroidal B-fields tend naturally to evolve into
potent gravitational-wave (gw) emitters. The toroidal field B_t tends to
distort the NS into a prolate shape, and this magnetic distortion can easily
dominate over the oblateness ``frozen into'' the NS crust. An elastic NS with
frozen-in B-field of this magnitude is clearly secularly unstable: the wobble
angle between the NS's angular momentum J^i and the star's magnetic axis n_B^i
grow on a dissipation timescale until J^i and n_B^i are orthogonal. This final
orientation is clearly the optimal one for gravitational-wave (gw) emission.
The basic cause of the instability is quite general, so we conjecture that the
same final state is reached for a realistic NS. Assuming this, we show that for
LMXB's with B_t of order 10^{13}G, the spindown from gw's is sufficient to
balance the accretion torque--supporting a suggestion by Bildsten. The spindown
rates of most millisecond pulsars can also be attributed to gw emission sourced
by toroidal B-fields, and both these sources could be observed by LIGO II.
While the first-year spindown of a newborn NS is most likely dominated by em
processes, reasonable values of B_t and the (external) dipolar field B_d can
lead to detectable levels of gw emission, for a newborn NS in our own galaxy.

the role of ``dynamical'' color in low energy QCD and provide valuable
information for experimental search for these new particles. In this paper, we
apply both improved gluon and quark actions to the hybrid mesons, which might
be much more efficient than the previous works in reducing lattice spacing
error and finite volume effect. Quenched simulations were done at $\beta=2.6$

term and a general nonlinear function F(k, V) of the Euclidean space-time
volume V. A partial differential equation governing its dependence on the scale
k is derived and its fixed point is analyzed. For the more restrictive
truncation of theory space where F(k, V) is of the form V+V ln V, V+V^2, and
V+\sqrt{V}, respectively, the renormalization group equations for the running

the k-dependent curvature of the S^4-type Euclidean space-times which are
solutions to the effective Einstein equations, i.e. stationary points of the
scale dependent effective action. For the V+V ln V-invariant (discussed earlier

enormously suppresses the value of the renormalized curvature which results
from Planck-size bare parameters specified at the Planck scale. Hence one can
obtain very large, almost flat universes without fine-tuning the cosmological

membrane as states of the dual 2+1 CFT. We show that states with a sufficiently
large mass really are 2+1 black holes where the quantum corrections dress the
classical conical singularity with a horizon and censor it from the outside. On
a negatively curved membrane, we reinterpret the classical bulk solutions as
quantum-corrected BTZ black holes. In D=4 we argue that the bulk solution for
the brane black hole should include a radiation component in order to describe
a quantum-corrected black hole in the 3+1 dual. Hawking radiation of the
conformal field is then dual to classical gravitational bremsstrahlung in the
AdS$_5$ bulk.

non-crossing cumulants of R. Speicher. Here we introduce the concept of {\em

  The non-crossing cumulants of type B live in an appropriate framework of
``non-commutative probability space of type B'', and are closely related to a
type B analogue for the R-transform of Voiculescu (which is the free
probabilistic counterpart of the Fourier transform). By starting from a
condition of ``vanishing of mixed cumulants of type B'', we obtain an analogue

power depends on the retarded acceleration of the charge. Therefore, for
consistency, an accelerated charge, free from the influence of external forces,
should gradually lose its acceleration, until its total energy is radiated.
Calculations show that the self force of a charge, which compensates for its
radiation, is proportional to the derivative of the acceleration. However, when
using this self-force in the equation of motion of the charge, one gets a
diverging solution, for which the acceleration runs away to infinity. This
means that there is an inconsistency in the solution of the single charge
problem. However, in the construction of the conserved Maxwell charge density,
there is implicitly an integral over the corresponding world line which
corresponds to a collection of charged spacetime events. One may therefore
consistently think of the ``self force'' as the force on a charge due to
another charge at the retarded position. From this point of view, the energy is
evidently conserved and the radiation process appears as an absorbing
resistance to the feeding source. The purpose of this work is to learn about
the behavior of single charges from the behavior of a real current,
corresponding to the set of chargesa moving on a world line, and to study the
analog of the self force of a charge associated with the radiation resistance
of a continuum of charges.

are partially ordered under local actions. In particular, the generic entangled
class of the maximal dimension, distinguished as the nonzero hyperdeterminant,
does not include the maximally entangled states in Bell's inequalities in
general (e.g., in the $n \geq 4$ qubits), contrary to the widely known
bipartite or 3-qubit cases. It suggests that not only are they never locally

boundary condition which is Dirichlet except at the segment of a length $2a$ of
one of the boundaries where it is switched to Neumann. This operator is known
to have a non-empty and simple discrete spectrum for any $a>0$. There is a
sequence $0<a_1<a_2<...$ of critical values at which new eigenvalues emerge
from the continuum when the Neumann window expands. We find the asymptotic
behavior of these eigenvalues around the thresholds showing that the gap is in
the leading order proportional to $(a-a_n)^2$ with an explicit coefficient
expressed in terms of the corresponding threshold-energy resonance
eigenfunction.
