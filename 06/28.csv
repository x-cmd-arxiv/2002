similar to the Envelope-Tracing method (Sofue & Rubin 2001) to analyse those
profiles from which we obtain HI rotation curves in good agreement with the

rotation curves in edge-on galaxies. The method to derive the rotation curve
from the position-velocity diagram in warped edge-on systems yields
underestimated velocities, and the tilted-ring model is not reliable in highly
inclined, poorly resolved galaxies. In a warped system the kinematical major
axis is different from the optical major axis. While this is generally a limit
in optical slit spectroscopy, in the HI emission which extends far from the
optical body where self-gravity is weaker and the effect of warping is more
pronounced, this represents a severe effect to be considered in the procedure
to extract the rotation curve. We propose a new approach to extract the
rotation curve in highly inclined, warped galaxies. Based on this method we are
able to trace accurately the frequency of peculiarities in our sample of Thick
Boxy Bulge (TBB) galaxies. We report an increasing trend of kinematical
lopsidedness from spheroidal bulge galaxies towards TBB galaxies. Concerning
the question whether interactions contribute significantly to the bar formation
and to the subsequent evolution in a box/peanut (b/p) structure, we confirm
these theoretical predictions. Based on our sample, galaxy interaction is the
likely formation mechanism to trigger bars in TBB galaxies.

Our techniques are applicable at all metallicities. In particular, for
metallicities above half solar, the ratio [NII]/[OII] provides a very reliable
diagnostic since it is ionization parameter independant and does not have a
local maximum. This ratio has not been used historically because of worries
about reddening corrections. However, we show that the use of classical
reddening curves is quite sufficient to allow this [NII]/[OII] diagnostic to be
used with confidence as a reliable abundance indicator. The cause of systematic
and random errors inherent in previous techniques are discussed, and we present
a new `optimal' abundance diagnostic method based on the use of line ratios
involving [NII], [OII], [OIII], [SII] and the Balmer lines. This combined
diagnostic appears to suffer no apparent systematic errors, can be used over
the entire abundance range and significantly reduces the random error inherent
in previous techniques. Finally, we give a recommended procedure for the

Ly-a absorption (N_HI > 10^15.2 cm^-2), as well as absorption from CIV and
often lower ionization species. The absorbing regions are conservatively
constrained to have L<=200 kpc and rho/rho_bar >= 2.5, with actual values
probably closer to L ~ 60 kpc and rho/rho_bar ~ 10-30. They also have two
distinct gas phases: one which produces photoionized CIV and SiIV at T ~ 30,000
K, and a second which is seen only in OVI. The OVI temperature is difficult to
constrain due to uncertainty in the amount of nonthermal line broadening, but
it does appear that this gas is hotter than the CIV/SiIV phase and could
support collisional OVI production. The OVI is strongly clustered on velocity
scales of dv=100-300 km/s, with weaker signal extending to dv = 750 km/s. The
power-law slope of the correlation function resembles that of local galaxy and
cluster surveys, with a comoving correlation length of 11h_{65}^-1 Mpc. The

toward understanding the connection between the burst and afterglow phases of
these events. The relation is roughly linear (i.e. doubling the pulse lag in
turn doubles the jet break time) and thus implies a simple relationship between
these quantities. We suggest that this correlation is due to variation among
bursts of emitter Doppler factor. Specifically, an increased speed or decreased
angle of velocity, with respect to the observed line-of-site, of burst ejecta
will result in shorter perceived pulse lags in GRBs as well as quicker
evolution of the external shock of the afterglow to the time when the jet
becomes obvious, i.e. the jet-break time. Thus this observed variation among
GRBs may result from a perspective effect due to different observer angles of a
morphologically homogeneous populations of GRBs.
  Also, a conjecture is made that peak luminosities not only vary inversely
with burst timescale, but also are directly proportional to the spectral break
energy. If true, this could provide important information for explaining the

of scenarios, such as the supranova-like models in which the progenitor pulsar
drives a powerful wind shocking against the ambient medium before it comes to
death and produces a fireball. We here study the early afterglow emission from
GRBs expanding into such a PWB environment. Different from the usual cold GRB
external medium, the PWBs consist of a hot electron-positron medium with
typical 'thermal' Lorentz factor of the order of gamma_w, the Lorentz factor of
the pulsar particle wind. After GRB blast waves shock these hot
electron-positron pairs, they will emit synchrotron radiation peaking at GeV
bands. It is shown that GeV photons suffer negligible absorption by the soft

still a matter of debate, and has recently been subject to upward revision
(Haywood, 2001). Our star sample was drawn from a set of solar neighbourhood
dwarfs with photometric metallicities. In a recent study, Reid (2002) suggests
that our metallicity calibration, based on Geneva photometry, is biased. We
show here that the effect detected by Reid is not a consequence of our adopted
metallicity scale, and we confirm that our findings are robust. On the
contrary, the application to Stromgren photometry of the Schuster & Nissen
metallicity scale is problematic. Systematic discrepancies of about 0.1 to 0.3
dex affect the photometric metallicity determination of metal rich stars, on
the colour interval 0.22< b-y <0.59, i.e including F and G stars. For F stars,
it is shown that this is a consequence of a mismatch between the standard
sequence m_1(b-y) of the Hyades used by Schuster & Nissen to calibrate their
metallicity scale, and the system of Olsen (1993, 1994ab). It means that
although Schuster & Nissen calibration and Olsen photometry are intrinsically
correct, there are mutually incompatible for metal rich, F-type stars. For G
stars, the discrepancy is most probably the continuation of the same problem,
albeit worthen by the lack of spectroscopic calibrating stars. A corrected
calibration is proposed which renders the calibration of Schuster & Nissen
applicable to the catalogues of Olsen. We also give a simpler calibration
referenced to the Hyades sequence, valid over the same color and metallicity
ranges.

exhibits multiple peaks in its light curve. The Einstein radius crossing time
for this event is approximately one year, which is unusually long. We show that
the motion of the Earth induces these multiple peaks in the light curve, since
the relative transverse velocity of the lens projected into the observer plane
is very small (v = 12.5 km/s). This is the lowest velocity so far published and
we believe that this is the first multiple-peak parallax event ever observed.
We also believe that this event may be exhibiting slight binary-source
signatures in addition to these parallax-induced multiple peaks. With
spectroscopic observations it is possible to test this `parallax plus
binary-source' hypothesis and (if this hypothesis turns out to be correct) to
simultaneously fit both models and obtain a measurement of the lens mass.
Furthermore, spectroscopic observations could also supply information regarding
the lens properties, possibly providing another avenue for determining the lens
mass. We found that most of the I-band blending is probably caused by light
from the lens or a binary companion to the source. However, in the V-band,
there appears to be a second blended source 0.35"" away from the lensed source.
HST observations will be very useful for understanding the nature of the
blends. We also suggest that a radial velocity survey of all parallax events
will be very useful for further constraining the lensing kinematics and
understanding the origins of these events and the excess of long events toward
the bulge.

excited levels 1v7, 1v6 and 1v5 of the hot core (HC) in Orion KL. The images
show that the spatial distribution and the size emission from the 1v7 and 1v5
levels are different. While the J=10-9 1v7 line has a size of 4''x 6'' and
peaks 1.1'' NE of the 3 mm continuum peak, the J=10--9 1v5 line emission is
unresolved (<3'') and peaks 1.3'' south of the 3 mm peak. This is a clear
indication that the HC is composed of condensations with very different
temperatures (170 K for the 1v7 peak and $>230$ K for the 1v5 peak). The
temperature derived from the 1v7 and 1v5 lines increases with the projected
distance to the suspected main heating source I. Projection effects along the
line of sight could explain the temperature gradient as produced by source I.
However, the large luminosity required for source I, >5 10^5 Lsolar, to explain
the 1v5 line suggests that external heating by this source may not dominate the
heating of the HC. Simple model calculations of the vibrationally excited
emission indicate that the HC can be internally heated by a source with a
luminosity of 10^5 Lsolar, located 1.2'' SW of the 1v5 line peak (1.8'' south
of source I). We also report the first detection of high-velocity gas from
vibrationally excited HC3N emission. Based on excitation arguments we conclude
that the main heating source is also driving the molecular outflow. We
speculate that all the data presented in this letter and the IR images are
consistent with a young massive protostar embedded in an edge-on disk.

compatible with the large scale Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies.
These effects counteract. Using recipes derived from numerical simulations, we
show that haloes are expected to be up to ~ 50% more concentrated in CDM models
with quintessence compared to Lambda-CDM models, the maximum increase being
reached for w ~ -0.6. For larger w, the amplitude of the power spectrum
decreases rapidly and makes expected halo concentrations drop. Halo detections
through weak gravitational lensing are highly sensitive to halo concentrations.
We show that weak-lensing halo counts with the aperture-mass technique can
increase by a factor of ~ 2 as w is increased from -1 to -0.6, offering a new
method for constraining the nature of dark energy.

collapse of the amplifying solutions vital to focussing and that no useful

consideration of absorption results in solutions that are always well behaved

The final porosity depends on the cohesion force scaled by the external

friction alone. This effect is weak for round particles, as long as the

magnetic field is applied along the crystallographic a-axis, while a field
applied parallel to the tetragonal c-axis does not affect the transition. The
magnetic contribution to the specific heat below T_N is well described by a sum
of a linear electronic term and an antiferromagnetic spin wave contribution.
Just below T_N, an additional positive curvature, especially at high fields,
arises most probably due to thermal fluctuations. The field dependence of the
coefficient of the low temperature linear term, gamma_0, extracted from the
fits shows a maximum at about 6 T, at the point where an anomaly was detected
in susceptibility measurements. The relative field dependence of both T_N and
the magnetic entropy at T_N scales as [1-(B/B_0)^2] for B // a, suggesting the

exponentiate as well. This leads to a non-perturbative factorization formula

be contrasted with the OPE. Two examples are discussed. The first is
event-shape distributions in the two-jet region, where a wealth of precise data
provides a strong motivation for the improved perturbative technique and an
ideal situation to study hadronization. The second example is deep inelastic
structure functions. In contrast to event shapes, structure functions have an
OPE. However, since the OPE breaks down at large x, it does not provide a
practical framework for the parametrization of power corrections. Performing a
detailed analysis of twist 4 it is shown precisely how the twist-2 renormalon

first stage of gauge symmetry breaking occurs through compactification and a
specific selection of boundary conditions. Additional symmetries play a crucial
role for the generation of $\mu $ and $B\mu $ terms of appropriate values: with
a $SU(2)_{cus}$ custodial symmetry the Higgs doublets naturally emerge as
massless pseudo-Goldstone bosons in the unbroken SUSY limit. After SUSY
breaking they get masses of the order of the weak scale. If instead of
$SU(2)_{cus}$ a discrete $Z_5$ symmetry is applied the Higgs doublet's masses
are still adequately suppressed, but they are not pseudo-Goldstones. The $Z_5$
discrete symmetry also can be very important for GUT scale generation and an
all order hierarchy. Fermion masses are naturally generated and nicely blend
with additional symmetries. In the considered scenario unification of the three
gauge couplings occurs near $10^{16}$ GeV.

product of the decay of primordial vector bosons.
  The effect of the intensive cosmological creation of these primordial vector
$W, ~Z $ bosons from the vacuum is studied in the framework of General
Relativity and the Standard Model where the relative standard of measurement
identifying conformal quantities with the measurable ones is accepted.
  The relative standard leads to the conformal cosmology with the z-history of
masses with the constant temperature, instead of the conventional z-history of
the temperature with constant masses in inflationary cosmology.
  In conformal cosmology both the latest supernova data and primordial
nucleosynthesis are compatible with a stiff equation of state associated with
one of the possible states of the infrared gravitation field.
  The distribution function of the created bosons in the lowest order of
perturbation theory exposes a cosmological singularity as a consequence of the
theorem about the absence of the massless limit of massive vector fields in
quantum theory. This singularity can be removed by taking into account the
collision processes leading to a thermalization of the created particles. The
cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature T=(M_W^2H_0)^{1/3} ~ 2.7 K occurs
as an integral of motion for the universe in the stiff state. We show that this
temperature can be attained by the CMB radiation being the final product of the
decay of primordial bosons.

polarization of the Dirac sea vacuum by these primordial bosons is considered.

from their original values, allowing an interpretation in terms of the
preservation of modular invariance in the effective theory. We address various
subtleties in defining unitary gauge that are associated with the noncanonical
Kahler potential of modular invariant supergravity, the vacuum degeneracy, and
the role of the dilaton field. We discuss the effective superpotential for the

exhibits an interesting interplay with the von Neumann condition previously
introduced by the author in his study of singular dual pairs. This condition
ensures that the orbits in the momentum space of the optimal momentum map (we
call them polar reduced spaces) admit a presymplectic structure that
generalizes the Kostant--Kirillov--Souriau symplectic structure of the
coadjoint orbits in the dual of a Lie algebra. Using this presymplectic
structure, the optimal orbit reduced spaces are symplectic with a form that
satisfies a relation identical to the classical one obtained by Marle, Kazhdan,
Kostant, and Sternberg for free Hamiltonian actions on a symplectic manifold.
In the symplectic case we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the
polar reduced spaces to be symplectic. In general, the presymplectic polar
reduced spaces are foliated by symplectic submanifolds that are obtained
through a generalization to the optimal context of the so called Sjamaar
Principle, already existing in the theory of Hamiltonian singular reduction. We
use these ideas in the construction of a family of presymplectic homogeneous
manifolds and of its symplectic foliation and we show that these reduction
techniques can be implemented in stages in total analogy with the case of free
globally Hamiltonian proper actions.

satisfactorily describe recent high-force stretching data. We instead propose a
model (the Discrete Persistent Chain, or ``DPC'') that borrows features from
both the FJC and the Wormlike Chain, and show that it resembles the data more
closely. We find that most of the high-force behavior previously attributed to
stretch elasticity is really a feature of the corrected entropic elasticity;
the true stretch compliance of single-stranded DNA is several times smaller
than that found by previous authors. Next we elaborate our model to allow
coexistence of two conformational states of DNA, each with its own stretch and
bend elastic constants. Our model is computationally simple, and gives an
excellent fit through the entire overstretching transition of nicked,
double-stranded DNA. The fit gives the first values for the elastic constants
of the stretched state. In particular we find the effective bend stiffness for
DNA in this state to be about 10 nm*kbt, a value quite different from either

reproducing almost all Quantum Mechanics (QM) predictions, where position plays
the role of a hidden variable. It was recently shown that different coincidence
patterns are predicted by QM and dBB when a double slit experiment is realised
under specific conditions and, therefore, an experiment can test the two
theories. In this letter we present the first realisation of such a double slit
experiment by using correlated photons produced in type I Parametric Down
Conversion. Our results confirm QM contradicting dBB predictions.

statistics or oscillations in photon-number distributions may survive longer in
a phase-sensitive environment than in a phase-insensitive environment. We
examine if entanglement, which is an inter-mode non-classical feature, can also
survive longer in a phase-sensitive environment. Differently from the
single-mode case, we find that making the environment phase-sensitive does not
aid in prolonging entanglement.

A, 67 (2003) 032306","10.1103/PhysRevA.67.032306",,"quant-ph",,"  The creation of specified quantum states is important for most, if not all,
applications in quantum computation and communication. The quality of the state
preparation is therefore an essential ingredient in any assessment of a
quantum-state gun. We show that the fidelity, under the standard definitions is
not sufficient to assess quantum sources, and we propose a new measure of
suitability that necessarily depends on the application for the source. We
consider the performance of single-photon guns in the context of quantum key
distribution (QKD) and linear optical quantum computation. Single-photon
sources for QKD need radically different properties than sources for quantum
computing. Furthermore, the suitability for single-photon guns is discussed
explicitly in terms of experimentally accessible criteria.
