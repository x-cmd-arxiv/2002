classical Kuiper Belt (41 AU < a < 47 AU) to explore the role of dynamical
instabilities in sculpting the inclination distribution of the classical Kuiper
Belt Objects (KBOs). We find that the selective removal of low-inclination
objects by overlapping secular resonances (nu_17 and nu_18) acts to raise the
mean inclination of the surviving population of particles over 4 billion years
of interactions with Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, though these
long-term dynamical effects do not themselves appear to explain the discovery
of KBOs with inclinations near 30 degrees. Our integrations also imply that
after 3 billion years of interaction with the massive planets, high inclination
KBOs more efficiently supply Neptune-encountering objects, the likely
progenitors of short-period comets, Centaurs, and scattered KBOs. The secular
resonances at low inclinations may indirectly cause this effect by weeding out
objects unprotected by mean motion resonances during the first 3 billion years.

nonlinear turbulent magnetic diffusion, the nonlinear effective velocity, the
nonlinear kappa-tensor, etc.) are calculated for an anisotropic turbulence. A
particular case of an anisotropic background turbulence (i.e., the turbulence
with zero mean magnetic field) with one preferential direction is considered.
It is shown that the toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields have different
nonlinear turbulent magnetic diffusion coefficients. It is demonstrated that
even for a homogeneous turbulence there is a nonlinear effective velocity which
exhibits diamagnetic or paramagnetic properties depending on anisotropy of
turbulence and level of magnetic fluctuations in the background turbulence.
Analysis shows that an anisotropy of turbulence strongly affects the nonlinear
mean electromotive force. Two types of nonlinearities (algebraic and dynamic)
are also discussed. The algebraic nonlinearity implies a nonlinear dependence
of the mean electromotive force on the mean magnetic field. The dynamic
nonlinearity is determined by a differential equation for the magnetic part of
the alpha-effect. It is shown that for the alpha-Omega axisymmetric dynamo the
algebraic nonlinearity alone cannot saturate the dynamo generated mean magnetic
field while the combined effect of the algebraic and dynamic nonlinearities
limits the mean magnetic field growth. Astrophysical applications of the
obtained results are discussed.

primordial spectra, and for a Universe with critical density, the mass variance
is less than 34% of its value thought earlier for the spectral index in the
range $1\leq n\leq 1.3$. We then extend our study to spectra with a
characteristic scale and find the accurate shape of the corresponding mass
variance. For a pure step in the primordial spectrum, the step in the variance
is smoothed around the characteristic scale $k_s$. For a spectrum with large
oscillations near $k_s$, we find a pronounced bump in the variance. This could
yield a significant part of the cold dark matter in the form of PBHs with mass
$M$ in the range $5\times 10^{15} {\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{21} {\rm g}$.

can similarly generalize 2-form electromagnetism to a kind of

should replace the Lie group by a ""Lie 2-group"", which is a category C where
the set of objects and the set of morphisms are Lie groups, and the source,
target, identity and composition maps are homomorphisms. We show that this is
the same as a ""Lie crossed module"": a pair of Lie groups G,H with a
homomorphism t: H -> G and an action of G on H satisfying two compatibility
conditions. Following Breen and Messing's ideas on the geometry of nonabelian
gerbes, one can define ""principal 2-bundles"" for any Lie 2-group C and do gauge
theory in this new context. Here we only consider trivial 2-bundles, where a
connection consists of a Lie(G)-valued 1-form together with an Lie(H)-valued
2-form, and its curvature consists of a Lie(G)-valued 2-form together with a

variational wavelet approach to rational (in dynamical variables)

multiscales and represent solutions via multiscale exact nonlinear eigenmodes
(waveletons) expansions. Our approach provides the possibility to work with
well-localized bases in phase space and best convergence properties of the
corresponding expansions without perturbations or/and linearization procedures.

preceding linearized/perturbative methods such as soft gaussian approximation
or FMM (HFMM) etc. In our approach discrete coherent modes, discovered before,
and possible incoherent oscillations appear as a result of
multiresolution/multiscale fast convergent decomposition in the bases of
high-localized exact nonlinear modes represented by wavelets or wavelet packets
functions. The constructed solutions represent the full multiscale spectrum in
all internal hidden scales from slow to fast oscillating eigenmodes. Underlying
variational method provides algebraical control of the spectrum.

to simulate certain aspects of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm on a desktop
or laptop computer. The program does not simulate the unitary operations
carried out by a quantum computer but does faithfully mimic its output at the
crucial ""readout"" step of the order-finding process. The program reqires only
two inputs from the user - the number to be factored (which can be up to 10
digits long) and the number of qubits to be used in the factoring (for which a
helpful hint is given). The program then returns a detailed history of all its
attempts at factoring the number, beginning with its various unsuccessful
attempts and ending with the final successful attempt that leads to the correct
factors. The structure of the simulation is described, a typical output
produced by it is shown, and the factors limiting its performance are
discussed. The purpose of this simulation is to provide the user with some
""hands-on"" experience of how quantum factoring works on integers somewhat
larger than can be handled by today's quantum computers.
