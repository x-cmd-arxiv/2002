only minimal dependence on the assumed cosmology. The variation of r with scale

dynamically excited Kuiper Belt. Further, even under optimistic assumptions
(including perfect accretion of the satellites), we find that collisional
processes cannot make KBO satellites at the observed frequency of occurrence
unless KBO projectiles large enough to generate the observed satellites were
\~40 times more numerous in the ancient past, resulting in an increased
collision rate with sufficiently large projectiles, or unless the fraction of
impact energy estimated to be imparted to ejecta is of order unity. Neither
alternative is very palatable. However, an easier to accept alternative also
exists: KBO primary and/or KBO satellite surface albedos presently be
underestimated by making the canonical assumption of 4% surface albedos;
specifically, surface albedos of KBO primaries and/or their satellites could be
in the neighborhood of 15% (or higher). This would reduce KBO primary and/or
satellite sizes and masses, thereby in turn reducing the required size of the
impacting projectiles required to generate KBO satellites, which in turn would
increase the impact rate with sufficiently large projectiles to values in line
with the observed fraction of KBOs with large satellites. This proposition is
expected to be easily testable with by SIRTF and by other means in the next 2

oscillations are studied. At moderate rotation rates, a strong coupling between
modes of spherical harmonic degree, $\ell$, differing by 2 and of the same
azimuthal order, $m$, takes place if the frequencies are close. This is a
common situation amongst main sequence pulsators. Numerical results for a
sequence of $\beta$ Cephei star models are reported for the two- and three-mode
couplings.
  One consequence of mode coupling is that modes of higher degree should be
considered in photometric mode identification. Modes with nominal degree
$\ell>2$ acquire substantial $\ell\le2$ components and therefore are more
likely to reach detectable amplitudes. Coupled mode positions in the amplitude
ratio - phase difference diagrams, based on multicolour photometry, become both
aspect- and $m$-dependent. Examples of the mode path in the diagram with
varying aspect are given. The diagrams remain a useful tool for mode
identification in rotating stars but the tool must be used with care.

to density ratio) is around 10^3, resulting in a Fe K line from He-like iron. A
supersolar abundance of iron is not required by the data. Interestingly, the
ionizing continuum must be harder than the observed one. We interpret this as
due to the fact that the observed continuum is dominated by the standard blast
wave emission, while the line is produced by reprocessing material located at

formation history of the host galaxy. ULXs in galaxies with vigorous star
formation (such as the Antennae) are generally SS433--like, while ULXs in

significantly anisotropic radiation patterns. They should also be variable, but
demonstrating this may require observations over decades. The close analogy

clouds occulting compact extragalactic mm-wave continuum sources, using the old
NRAO 43m telescope. Because radiofrequency observations of CH really must be
calibrated with reference to a known CH abundance, we begin by deriving the
relationships between CH, EB-V, H2 and other hydrides found by optical
spectroscopy. No simple relationship exists between N(CH) and EB-V, since N(CH)
is strongly bimodal with respect to reddening for EB-V < 0.3 mag and the
typical range in the N(CH)/EB-V ratio is an order of magnitude or more at any
given EB-V > 0.3 mag. However, N(CH)/N(H2) = 4.3 +/- 1.9 x 10^-8 in the mean
and N(CH) varies as N(H2)^(1.00+/-0.06) for 10^{19} < N(H2) < 10^{21} cm^-2. If
CH is a good predictor of H2, 40-45% of the hydrogen in the local
diffuse/translucent ISM is in the molecular form at the accepted mean density,
higher than previous estimates found in samples of lower-than-average mean
density. Optical observations of the population ratios in the upper and lower
halves of the CH lambda-doublet suggest that the brightness of the 3335 MHz CH
line should be double-valued at a given CH column density in diffuse gas:
double-valuedness is noticeable in our data when comparing CH with CO or HCO+.
The CH brightness at 3335 MHz is mildly bimodal with respect to CO emission in
our diffuse cloud data but much more strongly bimodal when comparing diffuse or
translucent gas and dark gas. The CH Lambda-doublet is generally inverted in
diffuse gas but we did not succeed in measuring the excitation temperature
except toward 3C123 where we confirm one older value Tex ~ -10 K.

Through applications to CuPd and CuZn alloys, we find that, as a general rule,
non linear charge rearrangements occur at the impurity site as a consequence of
the complex phenomena related with the electronic screening of the external

of lipid molecules into a strained region may lead to a substantial decrease of

Simultaneously, this same effect also causes appearance of the spontaneous
curvature of the membrane. Proposed stress relaxation mechanism may explain
recent experimental observations of a collapse of the ionic conductance through
the protein mechanosensitive channels piercing the E-coli's membrane. The
conductance decreases within seconds after opening of the channels by applied
external pressure. Theoretical estimates of the phospholipids diffusion time
inside the strained area is favorably comparable with the experimental data.

potential causes additional scattering which can dominate and actually prevent
absorption of the wave for large enough values of the imaginary part. We also
discuss the problem of maximizing the absorption of a wave and point out that
the existence of a bound state greatly aids absorption. We illustrate this
point by considering the absorption of light at the surface of a metal.

systems of particles interacting via a core-softened interparticle potential.
Two recently proposed examples of such potentials are considered; one in which
the hard core exhibits a shoulder, (Sadr-Lahijany et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81,
4895 (1998)) and the other in which the softening takes the form of a linear
ramp (Jagla, Phys. Rev. E63, 061501 (2001)). Using a combination of
state-of-the-art Monte Carlo methods, we obtain the gas, liquid and solid phase
behaviour of the shoulder model in two dimensions. We then focus on the
thermodynamic anomalies of the liquid phase, namely maxima in the density and
compressibility as a function of temperature. Analysis of the finite-size
behaviour of these maxima suggests that, rather than stemming from a metastable
liquid-liquid critical point, as previously supposed, they are actually induced
by the quasi-continuous nature of the two dimensional freezing transition. For
the ramp model in three dimensions, we confirm the existence of a stable
liquid-liquid (""second"") critical point occurring at higher pressure and lower
temperature than the liquid-gas critical point. Both these critical points and
portions of their associated coexistence curves are located to high precision.
In contrast to the shoulder model, the observed thermodynamic anomalies of this
model are found to be authentic, i.e. they are not engendered by an incipient
new phase. We trace the locus of density and compressibility maxima, the former
of which appears to converge on the second critical point.

gamma=1, and gamma>1. We also analyze the degree distribution of a
heterogeneous network, the joint age-degree distribution, the correlation
between degrees of neighboring nodes, as well as global network properties. An
extension to directed networks is then presented. By tuning model parameters to
reasonable values, we obtain distinct power-law forms for the in-degree and
out-degree distributions with exponents that are in good agreement with current
data for the web. Finally, a general growth process with independent
introduction of nodes and links is investigated. This leads to independently
growing sub-networks that may coalesce with other sub-networks. General results
for both the size distribution of sub-networks and the degree distribution are
obtained.

infinite horizon area $A$ or infinite $F$ (the coefficient at curvature in

infinite $A$ is compatible with a regularity of geometry in the case $T_{H}=0$
only. We also point out that infinite $T_{H}$ is incompatible with the
regularity of a horizon of a generic static black hole, both for finite or
infinite $A$. Direct application of the standard Euclidean approach in the case
of an infinite ''effective'' area of the horizon $A_{eff}=AF$ leads to
inconsistencies in the variational principle and gives for a black hole entropy
$S$ an indefinite expression, formally proportional to $T_{H}A_{eff}$. We show
that treating a horizon as an additional boundary (that is, adding to the
action some terms calculated on the horizon) may restore self-consistency of
the variational procedure, if $F$ near the horizon grows not too rapidly. We
apply this approach to Brans-Dicke black holes and obtain the same answer S=0
as for ''usual'' (for example, Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m) extreme classical black
holes. We also consider the exact solution for a conformal coupling, when $A$
is finite but $F$ diverges and find that in the latter case both the standard

represents a rare exception of a black hole without nontrivial thermal

high enough center-of-mass energy should produce black holes. The production
rate for such black holes at LHC has been extensively studied for the case of a
proton-proton collision. In this paper, we extend this analysis to a lead-lead
collision at LHC. We find that the cross section for small black holes which
may in principle be produced in such a collision is either enhanced or
suppressed, depending upon the black hole mass. For example, for black holes
with a mass around 3 TeV we find that the differential black hole production
cross section, d\sigma/dM, in a typical lead-lead collision is up to 90 times
larger than that for black holes produced in a typical proton-proton collision.
We also discuss the cross-sections for `string ball' production in these
collisions. For string balls of mass about 1 (2) TeV, we find that the
differential production cross section in a typical lead-lead collision may be
enhanced by a factor up to 3300 (850) times that of a proton-proton collision
at LHC.

the existence of a stable lightest KK particle (LKP). In addition, the
degeneracy in the KK spectrum is lifted by radiative corrections so that all

the Standard Model lives in five or six dimensions with compactification radius

indistiguishable. This method escapes the Gribov critique. We derive an exact
system of equations that closely resembles the Dyson-Schwinger equations of

exponents that characterize the asymptotic form at $k \approx 0$ of the
tranverse and longitudinal parts of the gluon propagator in Landau gauge, $D^T

importance of monopole operators is that in the Higgs phase, they create
Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices. We study properties of these operators in
three-dimensional QED using large N_f expansion. In particular, we show that
monopole operators belong to representations of the conformal group whose
primaries have dimension of order N_f. We also show that monopole operators
transform non-trivially under the flavor symmetry group, with the precise

D(G,K) of K-valued locally analytic distributions on G, and apply our results
to the locally analytic representation theory of G in vector spaces over K. Our
objective is to lay a useful and powerful foundation for the further study of
such representations.
  We show that the noncommutative, nonnoetherian ring D(G,K) ""behaves"" like the
ring of functions on a rigid Stein space, and that (at least when G is
Qp-analytic) it is a faithfully flat extension of its subring K\otimes Zp[[G]],
where Zp[[G]] is the completed group ring of G. We use this point of view to
describe an abelian subcategory of D(G,K) modules that we call coadmissible.
  We say that a locally analytic representation V of G is admissible if its
strong dual is coadmissible as D(G,K)-module. For noncompact G, we say V is
admissible if its strong dual is coadmissible as D(H,K) module for some compact
open subgroup H. In this way we obtain an abelian category of admissible
locally analytic representations. These methods allow us to answer a number of
questions raised in our earlier papers on p-adic representations; for example
we show the existence of analytic vectors in the admissible Banach space
representations of G that we studied in ""Banach space representations ..."",

a core of MU considered as a commutative S-algebra, although it is a core of MU

precisely the irreducible complexes, the minimal atomic complexes, and the
Hurewicz complexes with trivial mod p Hurewicz homomorphism above the Hurewicz

momentum. Such two-gap states can arise as a result of branching from the
one-gap solution of the self-consistent equations, describing SS or TS pairing
of nucleons, that depends on the relationship between SS and TS coupling
constants at the branching point. The density/temperature dependence of the
order parameters and the critical temperature for transition to the anisotropic
two-gap state are determined in a model with the SkP effective interaction. It
is shown that the anisotropic SS-TS superfluid phase corresponds to a
metastable state in nuclear matter.
