f=2N(H_2)/(2N(H_2)+N(HI))=1.7x10^-3. The depletion of heavy elements (S, Si,
Mg, Mn, Cr, Fe, Ni and Ti) in the central component is similar to that observed
in the diffuse neutral gas of the Galactic halo. This depletion is
approximately the same in the six CI-detected components independently of the
presence or absence of H_2. The gas clouds in which H_2 is detected always have
large densities, n_H>30 cm^-3, and low temperatures, T_01<~100 K. This shows
that presence of dust, high particle density and/or low temperature are
required for molecules to be present. The photo-dissociation rate derived in
the components where H_2 is detected suggests the existence of a local UV
radiation field similar in strength to the one in the Galaxy. Star formation
therefore probably occurs near these H_2-bearing clouds.

of such sharp gradients can be used to put interesting constraints on the

relatively cold. The compression induced by supersonic motions and shock
heating during the merger enhance the amplitude of gas density and temperature
gradients across the front. Our results indicate that cold fronts are
non-equilibrium transient phenomena and can be observed for a period of less
than a billion years. We show that the velocity and density fields of gas
surrounding the cold front can be very irregular which would complicate
analyses aiming to put constraints on the physical conditions of the

the spin axis of the model, the so-called ""turn-over angle"". Such an almost
axisymmetric model undergoes an early evolutionary phase of secular timescale,
with moment of inertia along the spin axis, I_{zz}=I_{33}, greater than the
moments of inertia along the equatorial axes, I_{11}=I_{22}, since rotation and
poloidal field (both deriving oblate configurations) dominate over the toroidal
field (deriving prolate configurations). During this phase, the model suffers
from secular angular momentum loss due to weak magnetic dipole radiation
activated by the poloidal field, leading gradually to ""dynamical asymmetry""
with I_{11}>I_{33}. However, a dynamically asymmetric configuration tends to
turn over spontaneously, i.e., to rotate about axis with moment of inertia
greater than I_{33}, with angular momentum remaining invariant. So, the fate of
a dynamically asymmetric configuration is to become an oblique rotator and,
eventually, a perpendicular rotator. During the so-called ""turn-over phase"",
the turn-over angle increases spontaneously up to 90 degrees on a ""turn-over

Si, S, Ar and Ca, arising in enriched material with an outflow velocity of
order 0.1c (Reeves et al. 2002). This was attributed to matter ejected from a
massive stellar progenitor occurring shortly before the burst itself. Here, we

complete probability distribution function for convergence fields. It is also
possible to construct the bias associated with the hot-spots in convergence
maps. These techniques can be used in both the quasi-linear and the highly
nonlinear regimes using various well developed numerical methods. We use these
results here to study the weak lensing statistics of cosmological models with
dark energy. We study how well various classes of dark energy models can be
distinguished from models with a cosmological constant. We find that the ratio
of the square root of the variance of convergence is complementary to the
convergence skewness $S_3$ in probing dark energy equation of state; it can be
used to predict the expected difference in weak lensing statistics between
various dark energy models, and for choosing optimized smoothing angles to
constrain a given class of dark energy models. Our results should be useful for
probing dark energy using future weak lensing data with high statistics from
galaxy weak lensing surveys and supernova pencil beam surveys.

superconductivity, and at higher pressure to paramagnetism. The maximum T_{SC}
results from the suppression of the paramagnon contribution. To form a Cooper
pair an electron transfers from one Fermi surface to the other. As a result,
the onset of superconductivity leads to the appearance of two Fermi surfaces in

p-density-wave state, d-density-wave state, and f-density-wave state) and four
types of quantum disordered states, i.e., Mott insulating states (S-Mott,

naturally leads to the Ising model in a transverse field as an effective theory

between the CDW state and the S-Mott state, where the Ising ordered states
correspond to doubly degenerate ground states in the staggered-flux or the

shown that there are three cases in the quantum phase transitions between a

criticality, and a first-order transition. The quantum phase transitions
between Mott states and between density-wave states are found to be the U(1)

harmonic trap. The condensates are set in motion by displacing the trap and
initially follow simple semiclassical paths, shaped by the lowest energy band.
Above a critical displacement, the condensate undergoes Bragg reflection. For
high atom densities, the first Bragg reflection generates a train of solitons
and vortices, which destabilize the condensate and trigger explosive expansion.
At lower densities, soliton and vortex formation requires multiple Bragg
reflections, and damps the center-of-mass motion.

the difference of times t-t' for long enough times, this is the steady-state

time is proportional to the characteristic distance of the clusters of pinning

law. The two-step relaxation is lost at a given wave length of the Fourier

The alternative possibility of having such operators in the Kahler potential as

differences with respect to the standard scenario: first, the scale of
L-violation can be lowered dramatically and neutrino masses have a different
tan beta-dependence; second, the renormalization of these operators has
remarkable properties: in many cases it improves drastically the stability of
neutrino textures against radiative corrections, while in others it makes
possible to generate radiatively large mixing angles in a natural way. In
particular, the mass splitting and mixing angle of solar neutrinos (LAMSW

world KK excited modes of the bulk gauge field localized around the y = pi R

formulae for real masses (Gell-Mann--Okubo, Schwinger and Ideal Mixing ones)
and the imaginary parts of CMSR give appropriate sum rules for the total
hadronic widths - width sum rules (WSR). Most of the observed meson nonets
satisfy the Schwinger mass formula (S nonets). The CMSR predict for S nonet
that the points $(m,\Gamma{})$ form the rectilinear stitch (RS) on the complex
mass plane. For low-mass nonets WSR are strongly violated due to
``kinematical'' suppression of the particle decays, but the violation decreases
as the mass icreases and disappears above $\sim 1.5 GeV$. The slope $k_s$ of
the RS is not predicted, but the data show that it is negative for all S nonets
and its numerical values are concentrated in the vicinity of the value -0.5. If
$k_s$ is known for a nonet, we can evaluate ``kinematical'' suppressions of its
individual particles. The masses and the widths of the S nonet mesons submit to
some rules of ordering which matter in understanding the properties of the
nonet. We give the table of the S nonets indicating masses, widths, mass and
width orderings. We show also mass-width diagrams for them. We suggest to
recognize a few multiplets as degenerate octets. In Appendix we analyze the

connects all these approaches. This quantum field theory is well-defined within
the framework of Wightman's axioms and Wightman's positive definiteness
condition. The physical meaning of the definition of Wightman's observables on
the class of test functions from S_0(R^2) instead of S(R^2), as required by
Wightman's axioms, is the irrelevance of the collective zero-mode related to
the collective motion of the ``center of mass'' of the free massless
(pseudo)scalar field, which can be deleted from the intermediate states of
correlation functions (Eur. Phys. J. C 24, 653 (2002)). In such a theory the
continuous symmetry, induced by shifts of the massless (pseudo)scalar field, is
spontaneously broken and there is a non-vanishing spontaneous magnetization.
The obtained results are discussed in connection with Coleman's theorem
asserting the absence of Goldstone bosons and spontaneously broken continuous
symmetry in quantum field theories defined in 1+1-dimensional space-time.

"nlin/0206045","Yair Zarmi","Peter B. Kahn and Yair Zarmi","Limitations of the Method of Multiple-Time-Scales",,,,,"nlin.SI",,"  In the Method of Multiple-Time-Scales (MMTS), the introduction of independent
time scales and the elimination of secular terms in the fast time variable, T0
= t, lead to the well-known solvability conditions. Starting from first order,
free terms (solutions of the unperturbed equations) emerge in every order in
the expansion of the approximate solution. In orders higher than first, the
amplitudes of these free terms appear in the solvability conditions. Contrary
to the common belief, in the MMTS analysis, these free terms play a role above
and beyond the satisfaction of initial conditions: They make feasible mutual
consistency among solvability conditions that arise in different orders. In
general, this consistency may not be ensured if the free terms are chosen
arbitrarily (e.g., set to zero, as is commonly done in many applications). If
consistency is not ensured, the analysis may lead to wrong results, or allow
only trivial solutions.
  The solvability conditions constitute a system of PDE's for the dependence of
the amplitudes that appear in the expansion on the slow time scales. However,
whenever the free amplitudes must be included to ensure a consistent expansion,
these PDE's cannot determine the dependence of the solution on slow time
variables beyond the first one, T1=epsilo*t. The dependence on slower time
scales, Tn=epsilon^n*t, n > 1, must be imposed either through initial data at,
say, T1 = 0, or through requirements on the structure of the approximate
solution (based, for example, on physical intuition) that are not related to
the validity of the perturbative scheme.
  These claims are illustrated through several simple examples, and then
discussed in the general case.

made at the IReS Strasbourg {\sc VIVITRON} Tandem facility at bombarding
energies of $E_{lab} (^{28}$Si) = 112 MeV and 180 MeV by using the {\sc ICARE}
charged particle multidetector array. The energy spectra, velocity
distributions, and both in-plane and out-of-plane angular correlations of light
charged particles are compared to statistical-model calculations using a
consistent set of parameters with spin-dependent level densities. The analysis
suggests the onset of large nuclear deformation in $^{40}$Ca at high spin.

present formalism of quantum mechanics and widely believed as a reality by
physicists, is in fact absent. Spooky nonlocal state reduction is the most, and
perhaps the only irrational feature of present day physics. There are
experimental results that reject nonlocal state reduction at a distance. Also,
there are arguments that show that signal locality itself can be violated if
there is true nonlocal collapse of the wavefunction. The Bell's inequalities,
the violation of which polarized physicists in favour of nonlocality, arise not
due to nonlocality, but due to ignoring prior information on correlations
encoded in the phase of local probability amplitudes. Here I discuss an
experiment involving particles entangled in energy and time variables that
shows that there is no nonlocal state reduction during measurements on
entangled particles. Quantum mechanics is inconsistent if it includes the
concept of wavefunction collapse as a physical process for entangled
multi-particle systems.
