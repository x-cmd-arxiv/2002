by Einstein, ROSAT and ASCA revealing a mix of binaries, supernova remnants and
HII regions. However, these observatories were unable to resolve X-ray sources
in galaxies beyond the local group. With Chandra's exquisite spatial resolution
we are able to resolve sources in a sample of nearby galaxies. We show that
there are highly significant differences in the X-ray colors of sources in
bulge and disk systems. These differences can be used as a basis to classify
sources as low and high mass X-ray binaries, supernova remnants and supersoft
sources. While it is impossible to identify any individual source on the basis
of X-ray color alone, the observations presented here suggest that it is
possible to separate sources into groups dominated by a single type of source.
This classification scheme is likely to be very useful in population studies,
where it is crucial to distinguish between different classes of objects.

Basically, evolutionary time scale ratios are compared with star numbers ratios
on the main sequence. Star populations are synthesized using grids of
evolutionary tracks computed with various overshooting amounts. Observational
material is provided by the large and homogeneous photometric database of OGLE
2 project for the Magellanic clouds. Attention is paid to the study of
uncertainties: distance modulus, intergalactic and interstellar reddening, IMF
slope and average binarity rate. Rotation and chemical composition gradient are
also considered. The result for the overshooting distance is l_over(SMC)= 0.40
+0.12-0.06 Hp (Z=0.004) and l_over(LMC)= 0.10+0.17-0.10 Hp (Z=0.008) suggesting
a possible dependence of the extent of the mixed central regions with
metallicity within the considered mass range. Unfortunately it is not yet

theory are rather cumbersome for the junctions including such contacts. A
technique based on deriving a system of self-consistent equations for the

developed. These equations are concise when written in the proper notations.
Moreover, the resistance of a two-contact junction can be expressed in terms of
""gamma""'s of both contacts. This equation makes calculating the spin valve
effect straightforward, allows to find an explicit expression for the junction
resistance and to prove that its nonequilibrium part is positive. Relation of
these parameters to different phenomena like spin-e.m.f. and the junction
transients is established. Comparative effect of the Coulomb screening on
different parameters is clarified. It is also shown that the spin
non-conservation in a contact can have a dramatic effect on the non-equilibrium

assumed to be on the impurity sites, while in the Zn-doped materials the

currently target the retrieval of technical documents, and therefore the
performance of our system is highly dependent on the quality of the translation
of technical terms. However, the technical term translation is still
problematic in that technical terms are often compound words, and thus new
terms are progressively created by combining existing base words. In addition,
Japanese often represents loanwords based on its special phonogram.
Consequently, existing dictionaries find it difficult to achieve sufficient
coverage. To counter the first problem, we produce a Japanese/English
dictionary for base words, and translate compound words on a word-by-word
basis. We also use a probabilistic method to resolve translation ambiguity. For
the second problem, we use a transliteration method, which corresponds words
unlisted in the base word dictionary to their phonetic equivalents in the
target language. We evaluate our system using a test collection for CLIR, and
show that both the compound word translation and transliteration methods
improve the system performance.

meridional annuli only. As an application we show that when considering two
Heegaard surfaces that intersect essentially and spinally (cf. Rubinstein and
Shcarlemann) any embedded torus in the union of the two bounds a solid torus.
