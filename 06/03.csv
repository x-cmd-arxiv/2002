holes, formed when a neutron star is disrupted by a black hole in a binary
system. Initial conditions are taken from 3D calculations of coalescing
binaries. Assuming azimuthal symmetry, we follow the time dependence of the
disk structure for 0.2 seconds. We use an ideal gas e.o.s., and assume that all
the dissipated energy is radiated away. The disks evolve due to viscous
stresses, modeled with an alpha law. We study the disk structure, and the
strong meridional circulations that are established and persist throughout our
calculations. These consist of strong outflows along the equatorial plane that
reverse direction close to the surface of the disk and converge on the
accretor. In the context of GRBs, we estimate the energy released from the
system in neutrinos and through magnetic-dominated mechanisms, and find it can
be as high as 10^52 erg and 10^51 erg respectively, during an estimated
timescale of 0.1-0.2 seconds. neutrino-anti neutrino annihilation is likely to
produce bursts from only an impulsive energy input (the annihilation luminosity
scales as t^(-5/2)) and so would be unable to account for a large fraction of
bursts with complicated light curves. However a gas mass ~0.1-0.25 Msun
survives in the orbiting debris, enabling strong magnetic fields (~10^16 Gauss)
to be anchored in the dense matter long enough to power short GRBs. We also
investigate the continuous energy injection that arises as the black hole
slowly swallows the rest of the disk and discuss its consequences on the GRB
afterglow emission.

in an intermediate polar system, has been rejected by other authors. We show
that a face-on, stream-fed intermediate polar model for the two systems is
viable and preferable to the other models. In each case, the X-ray modulation
periods then represent the rotation of the white dwarf in the binary reference
frame. The model explains the fully modulated X-ray pulse profiles, the X-ray
spectra, the antiphase between X-ray and optical/infrared modulation, the lack
of longer period modulation, and the low level of polarization. The optical
spectrum of RX J0806.3+1527 suggests that Balmer series lines are present,
blended with HeII lines. This is unlike the spectra of any of the known AM CVn
stars and suggests that the system is not a double degenerate binary. The
optical spectrum of RX J1914.4+2456 has spectral features that are consistent
with those of a K star, ruling out the double degenerate models in this case.
The lack of optical/infrared emission lines in RX J1914.4+2456 may be
attributed to a high mass accretion rate and its face-on orientation. Its
reported period decrease may be a short term spin-up episode driven by the
current high M-dot. Finally we suggest that there is an observational selection
effect such that the face-on intermediate polars that are detected will all
have a stream-fed component, and the purely stream-fed intermediate polars that
are detected will all be face-on systems.

density and V is the volume. By extending our theory to general situations, we
examined the EM-T diagram in detail, and found the following properties: 1) The
universal correlation sequence (``main sequence flares'') with $EM \propto
T^{17/2}$ corresponds to the case of constant heating flux or equivalently the
case of constant magnetic field strength in the reconnection model. 2) The EM-T
diagram has a forbidden region, where gas pressure of flares exceeds magnetic
pressure. 3) There is a coronal branch with $EM \propto T^{15/2}$ for $T< 10^7$
K, and $EM \propto T^{13/2}$ for $T> 10^7$ K. This branch is situated left side
of the main sequence flares in the EM-T diagram. 4) There is another forbidden
region determined by the length of flare loop; a lower limit of flare loop is
$10^7$ cm. Small flares near this limit correspond to nanoflares observed by
SOHO/EIT. 5) We can plot flare evolution track on the EM-T diagram. A flare
evolves from the coronal branch to main sequence flares, then returns to the
coronal branch eventually. These properties of the EM-T diagram are similar to
those of the HR diagram for stars, and thus we propose that the EM-T diagram is
quite useful to estimate the physical quantities (loop length, heating flux,
magnetic field strength, total energy and so on) of flares and corona when

second the initial thickness of the galactic disk, and third the spatial
distribution of the clumps. We find that the massive end of the mass spectrum

is a certain thickness at which the heating owing to the interaction with the

between +0.4 and -1.0, [Fe/H] = -5.6 delta-hk + 0.125, with no evidence for a
color dependence in the slope. For the G and K dwarfs, the Hyades mean relation
crosses the field star distribution in the two-color diagram, defining an
approximate UPPER bound for the local disk stars. Stars found above the Hyades
stars fall in at least one of three categories: [Fe/H] below -0.7, [Fe/H] above
that of the Hyades, or chromospherically active. It is concluded that, contrary
to the predictions of model atmospheres, the hk index for cool dwarfs at a
given color hits a maximum value for stars below solar composition and, with
increasing [Fe/H] above some critical value, declines. This trend is
consistent, however, with the predictions from synthetic indices based upon
much narrower Ca filters where the crossover is caused by the metallicity
sensitivity of b-y.

branched, two-step mechanism dictated by near e-h symmetry. The initial
relaxation occurs rapidly with nearly half of the population going into
excitons ($S_{XT}$ or $T_{XT}$), while the remaining portion remains locked in
metastable CT states. While formation rates of $S_{CT}$ and $T_{CT}$ are nearly
equal, $S_{XT}$ is formed about twice as fast $T_{XT}$ in concurrence with
experimental observations of these systems. Furthermore, breaking e-h symmetry
suppresses the XT to CT branching ratio for triplets and opens a slow CT$\to$
XT conversion channel exclusively for singlets due to dipole-dipole
interactions between geminate and non-geminate configurations. Finally, our
calculations yield a remarkable linear relation between chain length and
singlet/triplet branching ratio which can be explained in terms of the binding

  Logic Programming",,,,"cs.AI",,"  Representing defeasibility is an important issue in common sense reasoning.
In reasoning about action and change, this issue becomes more difficult because
domain and action related defeasible information may conflict with general
inertia rules. Furthermore, different types of defeasible information may also
interfere with each other during the reasoning. In this paper, we develop a
prioritized logic programming approach to handle defeasibilities in reasoning
about action. In particular, we propose three action languages {\cal AT}^{0},
{\cal AT}^{1} and {\cal AT}^{2} which handle three types of defeasibilities in
action domains named defeasible constraints, defeasible observations and
actions with defeasible and abnormal effects respectively. Each language with a
higher superscript can be viewed as an extension of the language with a lower
superscript. These action languages inherit the simple syntax of {\cal A}
language but their semantics is developed in terms of transition systems where
transition functions are defined based on prioritized logic programs. By
illustrating various examples, we show that our approach eventually provides a
powerful mechanism to handle various defeasibilities in temporal prediction and
postdiction. We also investigate semantic properties of these three action
languages and characterize classes of action domains that present more
desirable solutions in reasoning about action within the underlying action
languages.

is to identify redundancies in the set of all frequent itemsets and to exploit
these redundancies in order to reduce the result of a mining operation. We
present deduction rules to derive tight bounds on the support of candidate
itemsets. We show how the deduction rules allow for constructing a minimal

our proposal and recent proposals for concise representations and we give the
results of experiments on real-life datasets that show the effectiveness of the

mining the concise representation, and then creating the frequent itemsets from

attained in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions. Flow measurements also
provide a means of distinguishing between hydrodynamic models and calculations
which approach the low density (dilute gas) limit. Among the effects that can
complicate the interpretation of elliptic flow measurements are azimuthal
correlations that are unrelated to the reaction plane (non-flow correlations).
Using data for Au + Au collisions at sqrt{s_{NN}} = 130 GeV from the STAR TPC,
it is found that four-particle correlation analyses can reliably separate flow
and non-flow correlation signals. The latter account for on average about 15%
of the observed second-harmonic azimuthal correlation, with the largest
relative contribution for the most peripheral and the most central collisions.
The results are also corrected for the effect of flow variations within
centrality bins. This effect is negligible for all but the most central bin,
where the correction to the elliptic flow is about a factor of two. A simple
new method for two-particle flow analysis based on scalar products is
described. An analysis based on the distribution of the magnitude of the flow
vector is also described.

propagation, and decay of nucleon resonances -- in the nuclear medium. For the

recently measured, but not yet fully analyzed, momentum distribution of He-4 by
the A1-collaboration from Mainz. Our approach predicts momentum distributions
for He-4 that rival some of the best non-relativistic calculations to date.

sufficient to initiate particle accumulation and the consequent formation of a

the plasma will exhibit non-Markovian aspects of the strong-field pair
production process and the plasma's internal currents will generate an electric
field whose interference with that of the laser leads to plasma oscillations.

two-level atom in a standing-wave microcavity. Fractal-like structures, typical
for chaotic scattering, are numerically found in the dependencies of outgoing
positions and momenta of scattered atoms on their ingoing values and in the
dependence of exit times of cold atoms on their initial momenta in the generic
semiclassical models of cavity QED (1) with atoms in a far-detuned amplitude
(phase)-modulated standing wave and (2) with coupled atomic external and
internal degrees of freedom. Tiny interplay between all the degrees of freedom
in the second model is responsible for trapping atoms even in a very short
microcavity. It may lead simultaneously, at least, to two kinds of atomic
fractals, a countable fractal (a set of initial momenta generating
separatrix-like atomic trajectories) and a seemingly uncountable fractal with a
set of momenta generating infinite walkings of atoms inside the cavity.

respect the data. That is, we implement a minimal curvature condition for the

multi-electrode data. We implement this approach using spherical harmonics
interpolation. In this elegant example we show that minimization requirement
and constraints complement each other to fix all degrees of freedom
automatically, as occurs in gauge theories. That is, the constraints are
respected, while only the orthogonal subspace minimization constraints are
enforced. As an example, we discuss the application to interpolate control data
and calculate the temporal sequence of laplacians from an EEG Mismatch

the main idea behind the above criterion and the necessary and sufficient
condition in terms of positive maps, we provide a characterization of separable
states by means of linear contractions. The latter need not be positive maps.
We extend the idea to multipartite systems, and find that, somewhat
suprisingly, partial realigment (unlike partial transposition) can detect
genuinely triparite entanglement. We also show that for multipartite system any
permutation of indices of density matrix leads to separability criterion.

contradiction with a largely accepted belief it is proved that the usual
procedures of quantum mechanics are accurately applicable for the $L_z-\phi$

known non-circular rotational motions. The presented facts contribute as
arguments to the following indubitable conclusions: (i) the traditional
interpretation of UR must be denied as an incorrect doctrine, (ii) for a
natural physical consideration of the the $L_z-\phi$ pair the results from the
usual quantum mechanics are sufficient while the improvised $L_z-\phi$ UR must
be rejected as senseless formulas and (iii) the descriptions of quantum

actual procedures of quantum mechanics. A QMS is described by means of
transformations of probability density and probability current, from intrinsic
into recorded readings. The quantum observables appear as random variables,
described by usual operators and valuable through probabilistic numerical
parameters (mean values, correlations and standard deviations). The values of
the respective parameters are not the same in the two mentioned readings. Then
the measurement uncertainties (errors) are described by means of the changes in
the alluded values. The new QMS approach is illustrated through an
one-dimensional example.

from the ground-state solutions with q=1 and q=-1. It is shown that the
""fermionic"" potentials cease to be PT invariant when the PT symmetry of the

SUSY construction is also discussed, in which the SUSY charge operators contain
the antilinear operator T. It is shown that in this scheme the ""fermionic""
Hamitonians are just the complex conjugate of the original ""fermionic""
