the exploitation of the stellar content of the Hamburg/ESO objective prism
survey (HES). In a simulation study we investigate the precision of a
three-dimensional classification (Teff, log g, [Fe/H]) achievable in the HES
for stars in the effective temperature range 5200<Teff<6800K, using Bayes
classification. The accuracy in temperature determination is better than 400K
for HES spectra with S/N>10 (typically corresponding to B_J<16.5). The
accuracies in log g and [Fe/H] are better than 0.68dex in the same S/N range.
These precisions allow for a very efficient selection of metal-poor stars in
the HES. We present a minimum cost rule for compilation of complete samples of
objects of a given class, and a rejection rule for identification of corrupted
or peculiar spectra. The algorithms we present are being used for the
identification of other interesting objects in the HES data base as well, and
they are applicable to other existing and future large data sets, such as those
to be compiled by the DIVA and GAIA missions.

to host a number of HI supershells. The association of the molecular gas
M(H2,F2) = 3.1x10^7 solar masses reported here with one of the HI supershells
(labeled F2) is clear, which suggests that molecular gas may have survived the
process which originally formed the supershell. Alternatively, part of the gas
could have been formed in situ at high latitude from shock-compression of
pre-existing HI gas. The CO J=2-1/J=1-0 line ratio of 0.34+-40% is
significantly lower than unity, which suggests that the gas is excited
subthermally, with gas density a few times 100 cubic cm. The molecular gas is
likely in the form of cloudlets which are confined by magnetic and cosmic rays
pressure. The potential energy of the gas at high latitude is found to be
2x10^56 ergs and the total (HI + H2) kinetic energy is 9x10^53 ergs. Based on
the energetics of the supershell, we suggest that most of the energy in the

verge of falling and returning the gas to the disk of the galaxy.

the possible explanations for this are that the LMC clusters possess [alpha/Fe]

Comparison of the SSP ages of the clusters (from Balmer lines) with the
literature data shows good agreement for the majority. This includes six old
globular clusters in our sample, which have ages consistent with their HST CMD
turn-offs. However, two clusters, NGC 1754 and NGC 2005, have Hbeta
line-strengths which lead to ages which are too young (~8 and ~6 Gyr
respectively at 3 sigma) for their HST CMDs. Comparison between the horizontal
branch (HB) morphology and Balmer lines of these clusters suggests that blue
HBs have increased their Balmer indices by up to ~1.0 angstrom. We conclude
that the Lick/IDS indices, used in conjunction with contemporary SSP models,
are able to reproduce the ages and metallicities of the LMC clusters
reassuringly well. However, SSP model ages derived for metal-poor globular
clusters are ambiguous without a priori knowledge of HB morphology (abridged).

parameters. We find that in spite of their similar optical appearance, the

classes. The first class consists of galaxies which can be described by a
single r^{1/4} law and the second class consists of galaxies that show an outer
exponential disk. A few galaxies that have disturbed profiles cannot be fit
into either of the above classes. However, all the galaxies are similar in all
other parameters such as the far-infrared colours, the molecular hydrogen
content and the central velocity dispersion. Thus, the dynamical parameters of
these sets seem to be determined by the ratio of the initial masses of the
colliding galaxies. We propose that the galaxies in the first class result from
a merger of spiral galaxies of equal masses whereas the second class of
galaxies results from a merger of unequal mass galaxies. The few objects that
do not fall into either category show a disturbed luminosity profile and a
wandering centre, which is indicative of these being unrelaxed mergers. Of the

fewer members, the correlations are underestimated, and the underestimation
amounts to a factor of 2 when the halos have only 20 particles. After
correcting for the resolution effects, we show that the ellipticity
correlations of halos in the bigger box (L=300 mpc) agree very well with those
obtained in the smaller box (L=100 mpc). Combining these results from the

dynamics of Na2O-2(SiO2) in its molten, highly viscous state. We find that at

about 100 times faster than the one of the Si and O atoms. In contrast to this
all coherent functions relax on the same time scale if the wave-vector is
around 1AA^-1. This anomalous relaxation dynamics is traced back to the
channel-like structure for the Na atoms that have been found for this system.
We find that the relaxation dynamics for Si and O as well as the time
dependence of the coherent functions for Na can be rationalized well by means
of mode-coupling theory. In particular we show that the diffusion constants as
well as the alpha-relaxation times follow the power-law predicted by the theory
and that in the beta-relaxation regime the correlators obey the factorization
property with a master curve that is described well by a von Schweidler-law.
The value of the von Schweidler exponent $b$ is compatible with the one found
for the mentioned power-law of the relaxation times/diffusion constants.
Finally we study the wave-vector dependence of f_s(q) and f(q), the coherent
and incoherent non-ergodicity parameters. For the Si and O atoms these
functions look qualitatively similar to the ones found in simple liquids or
pure silica, in that the coherent function oscillates (in phase with the static
structure factor) around the incoherent one and in that the latter is
approximated well by a Gaussian function. In contrast to this, f(q) for Na-Na
is always smaller than f_s(q) for Na and the latter can be approximated by a
Gaussian only for relatively large q.

The value of the field required to destroy the charge-ordered insulating state,

and the bulk material is explained by the difference of in-plane parameters at

the non-relativistic quark model. When we assign to baryon resonances with
total angular momenta J intrinsic orbital angular momenta L and spin S we make
the following observations: plotting the squared masses of the light-baryon
resonances against these intrinsic orbital angular momenta L, Delta's with even
and odd parity can be described by the same Regge trajectory. For a given L,
nucleon resonances with spin S=3/2 are approximately degenerate in mass with
Delta resonances of same total orbital momentum L. To which total angular
momentum L and S couple has no significant impact on the baryon mass. Nucleons
with spin 1/2 are shifted in mass; the shift is - in units of squared masses -
proportional to the component in the wave function which is antisymmetric in
spin and flavor. Sequential resonances in the same partial wave are separated
in mass square by the same spacing as observed in orbital angular momentum
excitations. Based on these observations, a new baryon mass formula is proposed
which reproduces nearly all known baryon masses.

observables consistency with conventional large N_c counting requires that
fluctuations in the instanton liquid are suppressed compared to Poissonian
fluctuations. Using mean field estimates and numerical simulations we show that
the required scaling behavior of the instanton density is natural in models in
which the instanton density is regularized in terms of a classical repulsive
core. We also show that in these models fluctuations of the topological charge
are suppressed and that m^2_eta'=O(1/N_c). We conclude that the instanton

describing the coupled dynamics of two metric tensors, and containing, in the

two paradigmatic cases: the case where the coupling between the two metrics is
given by a Pauli-Fierz-type mass potential, and the case where this coupling
derives from five-dimensional brane constructions. We find that cosmological
evolutions in bigravity theories can be described in terms of the dynamics of
two ``relativistic particles'', moving in a curved Lorenzian space, and
connected by some type of nonlinear ``spring''. Classes of bigravity
cosmological evolutions exhibit a ``locking'' mechanism under which the two
metrics ultimately stabilize in a bi-de-Sitter configuration, with relative
(constant) expansion rates. In the absence of matter, we find that a generic
feature of bigravity cosmologies is to exhibit a period of cosmic acceleration.
This leads us to propose bigravity as a source of a new type of dark energy
(``tensor quintessence''), exhibiting specific anisotropic features. Bigravity
could also have been the source of primordial inflation.

Grassmann integrations and which is to be obeyed by an unknown function over a
(finite-dimensional) Grassmann algebra G_m. A particular type of Grassmann
integral equations is explicitly studied for certain low-dimensional Grassmann
algebras. The choice of the equation under investigation is motivated by the
effective action formalism of (lattice) quantum field theory. In a very general
setting, for the Grassmann algebras G_2n, n = 2,3,4, the finite-dimensional
analogues of the generating functionals of the Green functions are worked out
explicitly by solving a coupled system of nonlinear matrix equations. Finally,
by imposing the condition G[{\bar\Psi},{\Psi}] = G_0[{\lambda\bar\Psi},
{\lambda\Psi}] + const., 0<\lambda\in R (\bar\Psi_k, \Psi_k, k=1,...,n, are the
generators of the Grassmann algebra G_2n), between the finite-dimensional
analogues G_0 and G of the (``classical'') action and effective action
functionals, respectively, a special Grassmann integral equation is being
established and solved which also is equivalent to a coupled system of
nonlinear matrix equations. If \lambda \not= 1, solutions to this Grassmann
integral equation exist for n=2 (and consequently, also for any even value of
n, specifically, for n=4) but not for n=3. If \lambda=1, the considered
Grassmann integral equation has always a solution which corresponds to a
Gaussian integral, but remarkably in the case n=4 a further solution is found
which corresponds to a non-Gaussian integral. The investigation sheds light on
the structures to be met for Grassmann algebras G_2n with arbitrarily chosen n.

"math/0206029","David Harris Wohl","David H. Wohl","Analysis of Zeta Functions, Multiple Zeta Values, and Related Integrals","9 pages",,,,"math.QA hep-th math.NT",,"  In this work, we begin to uncover the architecture of the general family of
zeta functions and multiple zeta values as they appear in the theory of
integrable systems and conformal field theory. One of the key steps in this
process is to recognize the roles that zeta functions play in various arenas
using transform methods. Other logical connections are provided by the the
appearance of the Drinfeld associator, Hopf algebras, and techniques of
conformal field theory and braid groups. These recurring themes are subtly
linked in a vast scheme of a logically woven tapestry.
  An immediate application of this framework is to provide an answer to a
question of Kontsevich regarding the appearance of Drinfeld type integrals and
in particular, multiple zeta values in: a) Drinfeld's work on the KZ equation
and the associator; b) Etingof-Kazhdan's quantization of Poisson-Lie algebras;
c) Tamarkin's proof of formality theorems; d) Kontsevich's quantization of
Poisson manifolds. Combinatorial arguments relating Feynman diagrams to Selberg
integrals, multiple zeta values, and finally Poisson manifolds provide an
additional step in this framework. Along the way, we provide additional insight
into the various papers and theorems mentioned above. This paper represents an
overall introduction to work currently in progress. More details to follow. See
our paper Math.QA/[ ] for a proof of the Connes Kreimer Conjecture.

diagrams and the Hopf algebra corresponding to the Homogenous Multiple Zeta
Value ring H in C<<X,Y>> . In other words, Feynman diagrams evaluate to
Multiple Zeta Values in all cases. This proves a recent conjecture of
Connes-Kreimer, and others including Broadhurst and Kontsevich.
  The key step of our theorem is to present the Selberg integral as discussed
in Terasoma [22] as a Functional from the Rooted Trees Operad to the Hopf
algebra of Multiple Zeta Values. This is a new construction which provides
illumination to the relations between zeta values, associators, Feynman
diagrams and moduli spaces.
  An immediate implication of our Main Theorem is that by applying Terasoma's
result and using the construction of our Selberg integral-rooted trees
functional, we prove that the Hermitian matrix integral as discussed in Mulase
[18] evaluates to a Multiple Zeta Value in all 3 cases:
  Asymptotically, the Limit as N goes to infinity, and in general.
  Furthermore, this construction provides for a positive resolution to
Goncharov's conjecture (see [7] pg. 30). The Selberg integral functional can be
extended to map the special values to depth m multiple polylogarithms on X.

hyperbolic rational map known as {\em spinning}. We show that under fairly
general hypotheses, the limit of spinning either exists and is unique, or else
converges to infinity in the moduli space of rational maps of a fixed degree.
When the limit exists, it has either a parabolic fixed point, or a pre-periodic
critical point in the Julia set, depending on the combinatorics of the data
defining the deformation. The proofs are soft and rely on two ingredients: the
construction of a Riemann surface containing the closure of the family, and an
analysis of the geometric limits of some simple dynamical systems.
  An interpretation in terms of Teichm\""uller theory is presented as well.

trajectories of a particle injected from an opening for the billiard, and then
observe how the opening size can change the classical chaotic properties of

(event-by-event) with {\bf p_n}, the measured, coincident neutron momentum. For
$|p_n|$ > k$_F$ = 0.220 GeV/c (the Fermi momentum) a strong back-to-back
directional correlation between {\bf p_f} and {\bf p_n} was observed,
indicative of short-range n-p correlations. From {\bf p_n} and {\bf p_f} we
constructed the distributions of c.m. and relative motion in the longitudinal
direction for correlated pairs. After correcting for detection efficiency, flux
attenuation and solid angle, we determined that 49 $\pm$ 13 % of events with
$|p_f|$ > k_F had directionally correlated neutrons with $|p_n|$ > k$_F$. Thus
short-range 2N correlations are a major source of high-momentum nucleons in
nuclei.

  to microcosm space-time geometry","49 pages, 4 figures, correction of misprints",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Usually a Riemannian geometry is considered to be the most general geometry,
which could be used as a space-time geometry. In fact, any Riemannian geometry
is a result of some deformation of the Euclidean geometry. Class of these
Riemannian deformations is restricted by a series of unfounded constraints.
Eliminating these constraints, one obtains a more wide class of possible
space-time geometries (T-geometries). Any T-geometry is described by the world
function completely. T-geometry is a powerful tool for the microcosm
investigations due to three its characteristic features: (1) Any geometric
object is defined in all T-geometries at once, because its definition does not
depend on the form of world function. (2) Language of T-geometry does not use
external means of description such as coordinates and curves; it uses only
primordially geometrical concepts: subspaces and world function. (3) There is
no necessity to construct the complete axiomatics of T-geometry, because it
uses deformed Euclidean axiomatics, and one can investigate only interesting
geometric relations. Capacities of T-geometries for the microcosm description
are discussed in the paper. When the world function is symmetric and T-geometry
is nondegenerate, the particle mass is geometrized, and nonrelativistic quantum
effects are described as geometric ones, i.e. without a reference to principles
of quantum theory. When world function is asymmetric, the future is not
geometrically equivalent to the past, and capacities of T-geometry increase
multiply. Antisymmetric component of the world function generates some metric
fields, whose influence on geometry properties is especially strong in the
microcosm.

parameters show that the wavepacket evolving on a linear orbit can be very
easily prepared in a laboratory either by a direct optical excitation or by
preparing an atom in an extremal Stark state and then slowly switching on the
microwave field. The latter scheme seems to be very resistant to experimental
imperfections. Once the wavepacket on the linear orbit is excited, the static
field may be used to manipulate the shape of the orbit.
