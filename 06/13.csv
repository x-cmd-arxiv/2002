be triggered to collapse as a result of sequential star formation. Five of the

comparing with velocity centroid data from previously obtained long-slit

each case, a purely ballistic model is insufficient in explaining observed DIG

not as steep as predicted by the model, possibly suggesting a source of
coupling between disk and halo rotation or an outwardly directed pressure
gradient. The ballistic model more successfully explains DIG kinematics
observed in NGC 5775; however, it cannot explain the observed trend of high-z
gas velocities nearly reaching the systemic velocity. Such behavior can be
attributed to either an inwardly directed pressure gradient or a possible tidal
interaction with its companion, NGC 5774. In addition, the ballistic model
predicts that clouds move radially outward as they cycle through the halo. The
mass and energy fluxes estimated from the model suggest this radially outward
gas migration leads to a redistribution of material that may significantly

Reynolds stresses and the meridional circulation in this process. We have found
that the Reynolds stresses are crucial in transporting angular momentum toward
the equator. The effects of baroclinicity (thermal wind) have been found to
have a modest role in the resulting mean zonal flows. The simulations have
produced differential rotation profiles within the bulk of the convection zone

the analysis of the spatial variation of the nebular extinction, we find a
large density contrast between the material inside the lobes and beyond them:
the optical lobes seem to be `cavities' excavated in the AGB envelope by
interaction with a more tenuous post-AGB wind. The electron density, with a
mean value n_e~5E3-1E4 cm-3, shows significant fluctuations but no systematic
decrease along the lobes, in agreement with most line emission arising in a

show that the angular dependence in arrival time can explain the general
characteristics of long GRB pulses. This includes the pulse shape, with a fast
rise and a slower decay, ~ (1+t/tau)^2, and the spectral evolution, which can
be described by the hardness-intensity correlation (HIC), with the intensity
being proportional to the square of the hardness. A variation of the relevant
time scales involved (the angular spreading and the dynamic) can explain the
broad, observed dispersion of the HIC index. Reasonable estimates of physical
parameters lead to situations where the HIC relation deviates from a pure power
law; features that are indeed present in the observations. Depending on the
relative values of the rise and decay times of the intrinsic light curve, the
spectral/temporal behavior, as seen by an observer, will produce hard-to-soft
or tracking pulses. The observed spectrum is a superposition of many intrinsic
spectra arriving from different parts of the shell with varying spectral
shifts. Therefore, it will be broader than the emitted spectrum and its
spectral parameters could have complex relations with the intrinsic ones.
Furthermore, we show that the softening of the low-energy power-law index, that
has been observed in some pulses, can be explained by geometric effects and
does not need to be an intrinsic behavior.

revealed significant numbers of ``passive'' spiral galaxies in distant
clusters, with all the morphological hallmarks of a spiral galaxy (in
particular, spiral arm structure), but with weak or absent star formation.
Exactly how such spiral galaxies formed and whether they are the progenitors of
present-day S0 galaxies is unclear. Based on analytic arguments and numerical
simulations of the hydrodynamical evolution of a spiral galaxy's halo gas
(which is a likely candidate for the source of gas replenishment for star
formation in spirals), we show that the origin of passive spirals may well be
associated with halo gas stripping. Such stripping results mainly from the
hydrodynamical interaction between the halo gas and the hot intracluster gas.
Our numerical simulations demonstrate that even if a spiral orbits a cluster
with a pericenter distance $\sim$ 3 times larger than the cluster core radius,
$\sim$ 80 % of the halo gas is stripped within a few Gyr and, accordingly,
cannot be accreted by the spiral. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that this
dramatic decline in the gaseous infall rate leads to a steady increase in the
$Q$ parameter for the disk, with the spiral arm structure, although persisting,
becoming less pronounced as the star formation rate gradually decreases. These
results suggest that passive spirals formed in this way, gradually evolve into
red cluster S0s.

  22 optical scalelengths and shows spiral arms reaching far beyond the optical
component. None of the previous theories for spiral structure provide likely
explanations for these very extended spiral arms. Our numerical simulations
first demonstrate that such large spiral arms can form in an extended gas disk
embedded in a massive triaxial dark matter halo with slow figure rotation,
through the strong gravitational torque of the rotating halo. We then show that
the detailed morphological properties of the developed spirals and rings depend
strongly on the pattern speed of the figure rotation, the shape of the triaxial
halo, and the inclination of the disk with respect to the plane including the
triaxial halo's long and middle axes. These results strongly suggest that the
dark matter halo of NGC 2915 is triaxial and has figure rotation. Based on
these results, we also suggest that dynamical effects of triaxial halos with
figure rotation are important in various aspect of galaxy formation and
evolution, such as formation of polar ring galaxies, excitation of
non-axisymmetric structures in low surface-brightness galaxies, and gas fueling
to the central starburst regions of BCDs.

to be determined by the acceleration of electrons at the termination shock of
the jet, their transport through the bright head region into the lobes and the
production of the radio emission by synchrotron radiation in the lobes. Models
presented to date incorporate some of these processes in prescribing the
electron distribution which enters the lobes. We have extended these models to
include a description of electron acceleration at the relativistic termination
shock and a selection of transport models for the head region. These are
coupled to the evolution of the electron spectrum in the lobes under the
influence of losses due to adiabatic expansion, by inverse Compton scattering
on the cosmic background radiation and by synchrotron radiation. The
evolutionary tracks predicted by this model are compared to observation using
the power/source-size (P-D) diagram. We find that the simplest scenario, in
which accelerated particles suffer adiabatic losses in the head region which
become more severe as the source expands produces P-D-tracks which conflict
with observation, because the power is predicted to decline too steeply with
increasing size. Agreement with observation can be found by assuming that
adiabatic losses are compensated during transport between the termination shock
and the lobe by a re-acceleration process distributed throughout the head
region.

significant variations within the observational precision of 0.003-0.004 mag

EDIP for silicon exhibits a range of unusual properties typically found in more
complex materials, such as the existence of two structurally distinct
disordered phases, a density decrease upon melting of the low-temperature
amorphous phase, and negative thermal expansion coefficients for both the
crystal (at high temperatures) and the amorphous phase (at all temperatures).
Structural differences between the two disordered phases also lead to a
first-order transition between them, which suggests the existence of a second
critical point, as is believed to exist for amorphous forms of frozen water.
For EDIP-Si, however, the unusual behavior is associated not only with the open
nature of tetrahedral bonding but also with a competition between four-fold
(covalent) and five-fold (metallic) coordination. The unusual behavior of the
model and its unique ability to simulation the liquid/amorphous transition on
molecular-dynamics time scales make it a suitable prototype for fundamental
studies of anomalous thermodynamics in disordeered systems.

to comment on two such developments: 1) Polymer-like states for Maxwell theory
and linearized gravity constructed by Varadarajan which use much of the Hilbert
space machinery that has proved useful in QGR and 2) coherent states for QGR,
based on the general complexifier method, with built-in semiclassical
properties. We show the following: A) Varadarajan's states {\it are}
complexifier coherent states. This unifies all states constructed so far under
the general complexifier principle. B) Ashtekar and Lewandowski suggested a
non-Abelean generalization of Varadarajan's states to QGR which, however, are
no longer of the complexifier type. We construct a new class of non-Abelean
complexifiers which come close to the one underlying Varadarajan's
construction. C) Non-Abelean complexifiers close to Varadarajan's induce new
types of Hilbert spaces which do not support the operator algebra of QGR. The
analysis suggests that if one sticks to the present kinematical framework of
QGR and if kinematical coherent states are at all useful, then normalizable,
graph dependent states must be used which are produced by the complexifier
method as well. D) Present proposals for states with mildened graph dependence,
obtained by performing a graph average, do not approximate well coordinate
dependent observables. However, graph dependent states, whether averaged or
not, seem to be well suited for the semiclassical analysis of QGR with respect
to coordinate independent operators.

for reconstructing the energy of the primary in a UHE cosmic ray shower, so
understanding it in detail is a prerequisite for having confidence in the

the ground level lateral distribution functions, as a function of the altitude
and energy at which the sub-showers are initiated. Far from the core, the
dominant contribution to the density of electrons comes from sub-showers
initiated at low altitudes and low energies (E<100 GeV). The dominant
sub-showers are initiated at large radial distance from the core and at a large

careful treatment of low energy hadron physics modeling even for ultrahigh

quark-mass dependent four-nucleon operators with coefficients that are
presently unknown. By varying these coefficients while leaving nuclear
observables at the physical values of the quark masses invariant, we find
scenarios where two-nucleon physics depends both weakly and strongly on the
quark masses. While the determination of these coefficients is an exciting
future opportunity for lattice QCD, we conclude that, at present, bounds on

and describe here a candidate model which we find attractive. Our starting
point is the assumption that off-diagonal CKM mixing matrix elements are
directly related by lowest order perturbation theory to the quark mass
matrices. This appears to be most easily and naturally implemented by assuming
that all off-diagonal elements reside in the down-quark mass matrix. This
assumption is in turn naturally realized by introducing three generations of
heavy, electroweak-singlet down quarks which couple to the Higgs sector
diagonally in flavor, while mass-mixing off-diagonally with the light
down-quarks. Anomaly cancellation then naturally leads to inclusion of
electroweak vector-doublet leptons. It is then only a short step to completing
the extension to three generations of fundamental representations of E(6).
Assuming only that the third generation B couples to the Higgs sector at least
as strongly as does the top quark, the mass of the B is roughly estimated to
lie between 1.7 TeV and 10 TeV, with lower-generation quarks no heavier. The
corresponding guess for the new leptons is a factor two lower. Within the
validity of the model, flavor and CP violation are ``infrared'' in nature,
induced by semi-soft mass mixing terms, not Yukawa couplings. If the Higgs
couplings of the new quarks are flavor symmetric, then there necessarily must
be at least one ``oasis'' in the desert, induced by new radiative corrections
to the top quark and Higgs coupling constants, and roughly at 1000 TeV.

$H$ on the interval $[-d,d]$ (coinciding with the spectrum of the discrete
Laplacian) is absolutely continuous. Then we show that generalized
eigenfunctions corresponding to this interval have the form of volume (bulk)
waves, which are oscillating and non decreasing (or slow decreasing) in all

number of reflected or transmitted plane waves scattered by the ""plane""

analogue of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. We also discuss the case of
rational vectors $\alpha$ for $d_1=d_2=1$, i.e. a periodic surface potential.

volume (Bloch) waves there are also surface waves, whose amplitude decays
exponentially as $|x_1| \to \infty$. The part of the spectrum corresponding to
the surface states consists of a finite number of bands. For large $q$ the

considered in order to determine possible chaotic behaviour in the systems. The
backbone of the analysis is the multi-symplectic formulation of the unperturbed

approach two separate symplectic operators are introduced for the spatial and
temporal variables, which allow one to generalise the usual symplectic
structure. The systems under consideration include perturbations of generalised
KdV equation, nonlinear wave equation, Boussinesq equation. These equations are
equivariant with respect to abelian subgroups of Euclidean group. It is assumed
that the external perturbation preserves this symmetry. Travelling wave
reduction for the above-mentioned systems results in a four-dimensional system
of ODEs, which is considered for Melnikov type chaos. As a preliminary for the
calculation of a Melnikov function, we prove the persistence of a fixed point
for the perturbed Poincare map by using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction. The
framework sketched will be applied to the analysis of possible chaotic
behaviour of travelling wave solutions for the above-mentioned PDEs within the

  physics: A new minimum principle and a status review","22 pages",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.gen-ph",,"  A new thermodynamic analysis is presented for the intimate connections
between blackbody radiation and zero-point radiation within classical physics.
First, using the thermodynamic behavior of an oscillator under an adiabatic
change of frequency, we show that the thermodynamic functions can all be
derived from a single function of w/T, analogous to Wien's displacement
theorem. The high- and low-frequency limits allow asymptotic energy forms
involving T alone or w alone, corresponding to energy equipartition and
zero-point energy. It is then suggested that the actual thermodynamic behavior
for a harmonic oscillator is given by the function satisfying the Wien
displacement result which provides the smoothest possible interpolation between
scale-decoupled energy equipartition at low frequency and scale-invariant
zero-point energy at high frequency. This leads to the Planck spectrum. Second,
we turn to radiation in a box with conducting walls and a conducting partition
so that the discrete normal mode structure of the box becomes important. The
contrasting Casimir energies are explored for the Rayleigh-Jeans and zero-point
spectra. The Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum involves no change of energy with
partition position, and the zero-point spectrum involves no change of entropy.
It is suggested that the Planck spectrum with zero-point radiation satisfies a
natural minimum principle which corresponds to greatest independence of the
system energy from the position of the partition for a fixed temperature.
Numerical calculation is used for confirmation. Third, we review the previous
derivations of the Planck radiation spectrum in classical physics, all of which
involve zero-point radiation.

but with no other approximations are called ""exact"" here. Exact equations
relating 2nd and 3rd-order structure functions are obtained, as is an exact

Ensemble, temporal, and spatial averages are all considered because they
produce different statistical equations. Exact equations have particularly
simple forms for the cases of an average over a sphere in r-space as well as
DNS that has periodic boundary conditions. The trace mitigates the effect of
anisotropy in the equations, thereby revealing that the trace of the
third-order structure function is expected to be superior for quantifying
asymptotic scaling laws. The midpoint and the difference of the two points at
which the hydrodynamic quantities are obtained are X and r; t is time.
Dependencies on X and on the orientation of r and on t fade as the asymptotic
statistical states of local homogeneity, local isotropy, and local
stationarity, respectively, are approached. The exact equations are thus
applicable to study of the approach toward those asymptotic states. A new
definition of local homogeneity is contrasted with previous definitions. The
approach toward the asymptotic state of local homogeneity is studied by using
scale analysis to determine the required approximations and the approximate
equations pertaining to experiments and simulations of the small-scale
structure of high-Reynolds-number turbulence, but without invoking local
isotropy. Those equations differ from equations for homogeneous turbulence.

density have persistently shown mobilities up to an order of magnitude smaller

in--homogeneity which is negligible in the thermal mobilities for He and other

at five temperatures with just one variable parameter. Recognizing that a gas
is not a homogeneous medium, a variation in local density combined with the
quantum multi--scattering theory, shifts the energy and cross section -- which
in turn changes the collision probability and finally the mobilities. A lower
density where a momentum transfer interaction occurs moves the mobility
strongly in the same direction as the anomalous experiments. By going backwards
from the observed mobilities, the collision frequency at each temperature and
density is made to reproduce the experimental data by looking for the local (as
opposed to average) density at which the (rare) momentum transfer interactions
occur. These density deviations give a picture of the size and behavior of the
