property of the first stellar systems to form and may also play a role in
various dark matter problems. We here determine the faint stellar luminosity
function in an apparently dark-matter-dominated external galaxy in which the
stars formed at high redshift. The Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy is a
system with a particularly simple stellar population - all of the stars being
old and metal-poor - similar to that of a classical halo globular cluster. A
direct comparison of the faint luminosity functions of the UMi Sph and of
similar metallicity, old globular clusters is equivalent to a comparison of the
initial mass functions and is presented here, based on deep HST WFPC2 and STIS
imaging data. We find that these luminosity functions are indistinguishable,
down to a luminosity corresponding to 0.3 solar masses. Our results show that
the low-mass stellar IMF for stars that formed at very high redshift is
apparently invariant across environments as diverse as those of an extremely
low-surface-brightness, dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxy and a
dark-matter-free, high-density globular cluster within the Milky Way.

of globular clusters in two early-type galaxies, NGC 3115 and NGC 4365. The
combination of near-IR and optical photometry provides a way to lift the
age-metallicity degeneracy. For NGC 3115, the globular cluster colours reveal
two major sub-populations, consistent with previous studies. By comparing the
V-I, V-K colours of the NGC 3115 globular clusters with SSP models, we find
that the colour difference between the two >10 Gyr old major sub-populations is
primarily due to a difference in metallicity. We find \Delta[Fe/H] = 1.0 +/-
0.3 dex and the blue and red globular cluster sub-populations being coeval
within 3 Gyr. In contrast to the NGC 3115 globular clusters, the globular
cluster system in NGC 4365 exhibits a more complex age and metallicity
structure. We find a significant population of intermediate-age very metal-rich
globular clusters along with an old population of both metal-rich and
metal-poor clusters. Specifically, we observe a large population of globular
clusters with V-K and V-I colours, for which all current SSP models give ages
and metallicities in the range ~2-8 Gyr and ~0.5-3 Z_solar, respectively. After
10 Gyr of passive evolution, the intermediate-age globular clusters in NGC 4365
will have colours which are consistent with the very metal-rich population of
globular clusters in giant elliptical galaxies, such as M87. Our results for
both globular cluster systems are consistent with previous age and metallicity
studies of the diffuse galactic light. In addition to the major globular
cluster populations in NGC 3115 and NGC 4365 we report on the detection of
objects with extremely red colours.

expected from a cluster-free background. We determine the luminosity functions
of the extra sources under the assumption that they are at the distance of
their respective clusters. The characteristic luminosity of the extra sources
around A1995 must be an order of magnitude fainter than that of the extra
sources around RXJ0030 and 3C295. The apparent lack of extra sources around
MS0451 is consistent with its greater distance and the same characteristic

extra sources in A1995 may have harder spectra than those of RXJ0030 and 3C295.
These results indicate that different classes of objects may dominate in
different clusters, perhaps depending on the formation history and/or dynamical

We construct a detailed model of the X-ray production accounting for the

(dE) galaxies. The mean line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion are
resolved as a function of radius along the major axis of each galaxy, nearly
doubling the total number of dEs with spatially-resolved stellar kinematics.
None of the observed objects shows evidence of strong rotation: upper limits on
v_rot/sigma are well below those expected for rotationally-flattened objects.
Such limits place strong constraints on dE galaxy formation models. Although
these galaxies continue the trend of low rotation velocities observed in Local
Group dEs, they are in contrast to recent observations of large rotation
velocities in slightly brighter cluster dEs. Using WFPC2 surface photometry and
spherically-symmetric dynamical models, we determine global mass-to-light
ratios 3 < M/L_V < 6. These ratios are comparable to those expected for an
intermediate-age stellar population and are broadly consistent with the (V-I)
colors of the galaxies. This implies that these dEs do not have a significant
dark matter component inside an effective radius. Central black holes more
massive than 10^7 M_sun can be ruled out. For the 5 nucleated dEs in our
sample, we determine kinematic and photometric properties for the central
nucleus separately from the underlying host dE galaxy. These nuclei are as
bright or brighter than the most luminous Galactic globular clusters and lie
near the region of Fundamental Plane space occupied by globular clusters. In
this space, the Virgo dE galaxies lie in the same general region as Local Group
and other nearby dEs, although non-rotating dEs appear to have a slightly
higher mean mass and mass-to-light ratio than their rotating counterparts.

the assumptions that quasar emission is triggered by galaxy mergers, and that
the black hole mass is proportional to a power-law in the circular velocity v
of the host galactic halo. We assume that quasars shine at their Eddington
luminosity over a time proportional to the mass ratio between the small and
final galaxies in the merger. This simple model fits the quasar luminosity
function at z~2-3, reproduces the normalization and logarithmic slope (beta
-2.58) at z~4.3, explains the space density of bright SDSS quasars at z~6.0,
reproduces the black hole - halo mass relation for dormant black holes in the
local universe, and matches the estimated duty cycle of quasar activity (~10^7
years) in Lyman-break galaxies at z~3. Based on the derived luminosity function
we predict the resulting gravitational lensing rates for high redshift quasars.
The lens fractions in the SDSS samples are predicted to be ~2% at z~4.3 and
~10% at z>5.7. Interestingly, the limiting quasar luminosity in our best-fit
relation of L proportional to v^5/G, scales as the binding energy of the host
galaxy divided by its dynamical time, implying that feedback is the mechanism
that regulates black hole growth in galactic potential wells.

several grids of models with different metallicities ranging from [M/H] = -2.0
to +1.0 dex. The grids range from 4000 to 10000 K in T_eff and from 2.0 to 5.0
dex in logg. The individual sets differ from each other and from previous ones
essentially in the physics used for the treatment of the convective energy
transport, in the higher vertical resolution of the atmospheres and in a finer
grid in the (T_eff, logg) plane. These improvements enable the computation of
derivatives of color indices accurate enough for pulsation mode identification.
In addition, we show that the chosen vertical resolution is necessary and
sufficient for the purpose of stellar interior modelling. To explain the
physical differences between the model grids we provide a description of the
currently available modifications of ATLAS9 according to their treatment of
convection. Our critical analysis of the dependence of the atmospheric
structure and observable quantities on convection treatment, vertical
resolution and metallicity reveals that spectroscopic and photometric
observations are best represented when using an inefficient convection
treatment. This conclusion holds whatever convection formulation investigated
here is used, i.e. MLT(alpha=0.5), CM and CGM are equivalent. We also find that
changing the convection treatment can lead to a change in the effective
temperature estimated from Stroemgren color indices from 200 to 400 K.

First, a high fraction of the observed LSBGs are very luminous in the near-IR,
indicating that they have a well developed old stellar population, and that
older LSBGs are more frequent in the universe than data from optical bands
suggested. Second, the near-IR morphologies are often quite different than seen

morphologies of the galaxies and their ratio of HI mass to near-IR luminosity.
Fourth, we find no trend in disk surface brightness with absolute magnitude,

Finally, we find that the formation of a bulge requires a galaxy to have a
total baryonic mass above ~ 10**10 Msun. A wide variety of other correlations
are explored for the sample. The strongest of our correlations are with the
ratio of HI mass to total baryonic mass, MHI/Mbaryonic, which tracks the
evolutionary state of the galaxies as they convert gas into stars, and which
ranges from 0.05 up to nearly 1 for the galaxies in our sample. We see also
trends between MHI/Mbaryonic and central surface density, suggesting that
increased star formation efficiency with increasing gas surface density

simulations of merging galaxy clusters have shown that mergers can temporarily
boost the X-ray luminosity and temperature of the merged cluster above the

""merger boosts"" will affect the observed X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) and
temperature functions (TFs) of clusters. Merger boosts may bias the values of
sigma_8 and Omega_0 inferred from cluster XLFs and TFs if virial equilibrium is
assumed. We use a semi-analytic technique to estimate the effect of merger
boosts on the X-ray luminosity and temperature functions. The boosts from
individual mergers are derived from N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of
mergers. The statistics of the merger histories of clusters are determined from
extended Press-Schechter (PS) merger trees. We find that merger boosts can
increase the apparent number of hot, luminous clusters. For example, in a
Universe with Omega_0 = 0.3 and Omega_Lambda = 0.7 at a redshift of z=1, the
number of clusters with temperatures T > 10 keV is increased by a factor of
9.5, and the number of clusters with luminosities L_X > 5x10^44 h^-2 erg/s is
increased by a factor of 8.9. We have used our merger-boosted TFs and XLFs to
derive the cosmological structure parameters sigma_8 and Omega_0 by fitting
Press-Schechter equilibrium relations to local (z=0) and distant (either z=0.5
or z=1) cluster samples. Merger boosts cause sigma_8 to be overestimated by
about 20%. The matter density parameter Omega_0 may be underestimated by about
20%, although this result is less clear.

the total magnification $\mu$ scales as $\mu \propto u^{-1}$, where $u$ is the
distance of the source from the cusp, whereas perpendicular to this axis, $\mu
\propto u^{-2/3}$. When the source passes through a point $\bu_0$ on a fold arc
abutting the cusp, the image centroid has a jump discontinuity; we present a
formula for the size of the jump in terms of the local derivatives of the lens

uniform and limb darkened surface brightness profiles. We find that the
difference in magnification between a finite and point source is $< 5%$ for
separations of $> 2.5$ source radii from the cusp point, while the effect of
limb-darkening is $< 1%$ in the same range. Our predictions for the astrometric

hump is due to synchrotron radiation by co-accelerated electrons. To accelerate
protons to sufficiently high energies to produce the high energy hump, rather
high magnetic fields are required. Assuming reasonable emission region volumes
and Doppler factors, we then find that in low-frequency peaked BL Lacs (LBLs),
which have higher luminosities than high-frequency peaked BL Lacs (HBLs), there
is a significant contribution to the high frequency hump of the SED from pion
photoproduction and subsequent cascading, including synchrotron radiation by
muons. In contrast, in HBLs we find that the high frequency hump of the SED is
dominated by proton synchrotron radiation. We are able to model the SED of
typical LBLs and HBLs, and to model the famous 1997 flare of Markarian 501. We
also calculate the expected neutrino output of typical BL Lac objects, and
estimate the diffuse neutrino intensity due to all BL Lacs. Because pion
photoproduction is inefficient in HBLs, as protons lose energy predominantly by
synchrotron radiation, the contribution of LBLs dominates the diffuse neutrino
intensity. We suggest that nearby LBLs may well be observable with future

losing stars of this type. The (molecular hydrogen) mass loss rate distribution
has a median value of 2.0E-7 solar masses per year. M-type IRVs and SRVs with a
mass loss rate in excess of 5E-7 solar masses per year must be very rare, and
among these mass losing stars the number of sources with mass loss rates below
a few 10E-8 solar masses per year must be small. We find no significant
difference between the IRVs and the SRVs in terms of their mass loss
characteristics. Among the SRVs the mass loss rate shows no dependence on the
period. Likewise the mass loss rate shows no correlation with the stellar
temperature. The gas expansion velocity distribution has a median of 7.0 km/s.
The mass loss rate and the gas expansion velocity correlate well, a result in
line with theoretical predictions for an optically thin, dust-driven wind. In
general, the model produces line profiles which acceptably fit the observed
ones.
  We have compared the results of this M-star sample with a similar C-star
sample analysed in the same way. The mass loss rate characteristics are very
similar for the two samples. On the contrary, the gas expansion velocity
distributions are clearly different. In particular, the number of low-velocity
sources is much higher in the M-star sample. We found no example of the sharply
double-peaked CO line profile, which is evidence of a large, detached CO-shell,

stars is limited by removal of angular momentum by gravitational radiation
which increases dramatically with the spin frequency of the star. Both Bildsten
and Andersson et al. argued that the r-modes of the neutron star for
sufficiently quickly rotating and hot neutron stars will grow due to the
emission of gravitational radiation, thereby accounting for a time varying
quadrupole component to the neutron star's mass distribution. However, Levin
later argued that the equilibrium between spin-up due to accretion and
spin-down due to gravitational radiation is unstable, because the growth rate
of the r-modes and consequently the rate of gravitational wave emission is an
increasing function of the core temperature of the star. The system executes a
limit cycle, spinning up for several million years and spinning down in less
than a year. However, the duration of the spin-down portion of the limit cycle
depends sensitively on the amplitude at which the nonlinear coupling between
different r-modes becomes important. As the duration of the spin-down portion
increases the fraction of accreting neutron stars which may be emitting
gravitational radiation increases while the peak flux in gravitational
radiation decreases. Depending on the distribution of quickly rotating neutron

distributions of velocities; the mean squared velocity, that is the so-called
{\em granular temperature}, is lower than the bath temperature. We observe that
a modified form of the Kubo relation, which relates the autocorrelation and the
linear response for the dynamics of a system {\em at equilibrium}, still holds
for the off-equilibrium, though stationary, dynamics of the systems under
investigation. Interestingly, the only needed modification to the equilibrium
Kubo relation is the replacement of the equilibrium temperature with an
effective temperature, which results equal to the global granular temperature.
We present two independent numerical experiment, i.e. two different observables
are studied: (a) the staggered density current, whose response to an impulsive
shear is proportional to its autocorrelation in the unperturbed system and (b)
the response of a tracer to a small constant force, switched on at time $t_w$,
which is proportional to the mean-square displacement in the unperturbed
system. Both measures confirm the validity of Kubo's formula, provided that the
granular temperature is used as the proportionality factor between response and
autocorrelation, at least for not too large inelasticities.

segments. The scattering amplitude is expressed in terms of the resolvent of a
non-Hermitian operator H. The explicit form of this operator depends both on
the radius of separation and the boundary conditions at this place which can be
chosen in many different ways. We discuss this freedom and show explicitly that
the physical scattering amplitude is, nevertheless, unique though not all

overlapping resonances. We apply the developed formalism to a chain of L
delta-barriers whose solution is also found independently in a closed form. For
a fixed band of L overlapping resonances, the smooth energy dependence of H can

them. This distance presents an inflection point near T~1 with a strong
decrease below this temperature and goes to a small but nonzero value on
approaching T_MCT. In the low temperature region we study the statistics of
events which give zero distance, i.e. dominated by minima, and find evidence
that the number of saddles decreases exponentially near T_MCT. This implies
that saddles continue to exist even for T<=T_MCT. As at T_MCT the extrapolated
diffusivity goes to zero our results imply that there are saddles associated
with nondiffusional events at T<T_MCT.

A particle and its antiparticle are described by the same modular irreducible

the different states of the same object. As a consequence, a new symmetry
arises, and the structure of the theory is considerably simplified. In

nuclei are obtained using the results for its selfenergy in a nuclear medium,
which is evaluated in a selfconsistent manner using techniques of unitarized
chiral perturbation theory. We find bound states in all studied nuclei (from
$^{12}{C}$ on) and the half widths obtained are larger than the separation of
the levels, what makes the experimental observation of peaks unlikely. We have
paid a special attention to the region of nuclei where only the $1s$ state
appears and the binding energies are of the order of magnitude of the half
width, which would magnify the chances that some broad peak could be observed.
This is found in the region of $^{24}{Mg}$ with a binding energy around 12.6
MeV and half width of 16.7 MeV. In heavy nuclei like $^{208}{Pb}$ there are
many bound states which would be difficult to disentangle and the deepest state
has a binding energy about 21 MeV and half width around 16 MeV. Such an
overlapping accumulation of states could be seen as an extension of the
continuum of $\eta$ strength into the bound region in $\eta$ production
experiments.

In the framework of a recently developed space-time-model for the germinal
center a mechanism for the formation of dark and light zones has been proposed.
The mechanism is based on a diffusing differentiation signal which is secerned
by follicular dendritic cells. Here, we investigate a possible influence of
recently found chemokines for the germinal center formation in the framework of
a single-cell-based stochastic and discrete three-dimensional model. We will
also consider alternative possible chemotactic pathways that may play a role
for the development of both zones. Our results suggest that the centrocyte
motility resulting from a follicular dendritic cell-derived chemokine has to
exceed a lower limit to allow the separation of centroblasts and centrocytes.
In contrast to light microscopy the dark zone is ring shaped. This suggests
that FDC-derived chemoattractants alone cannot explain the typical germinal
center morphology.

the adaptive capacity C_{1,A}, which lies strictly between the C_{1,1} and the

to be measured by a separate apparatus, but allows the quantum states of these

quantum states, and where measurements in subsequent stages which further
reduce the quantum states may depend on the results of a classical computation
taking as input the outcomes of the first round of measurements.

However, for these sizes the minimum energy gaps of most instances are fairly
large, so the good performance scaling seen for small problems may not reflect
asymptotic behavior where costs are dominated by tiny gaps. Moreover, the
resulting search costs are much higher than for other methods. Variants of the
quantum algorithm that do not match the adiabatic limit give lower costs, on
average, and slower growth than the conventional GSAT heuristic method.

continuous variables, momentum and position. Interference can only occur if the
wave function retains amplitudes for all possible decays. The interference can
be studied through the transverse momentum spectrum of the reconstructed
mesons.

acting directly on the logical qubit. In this paper we describe a procedure for
deriving the map between physical and effective channels that results from a
given coding and recovery procedure. We show that the map for a concatenation
of codes is given by the composition of the maps for the constituent codes.
This perspective leads to an efficient means for calculating the exact
performance of quantum codes with arbitrary levels of concatenation. We present
explicit results for single-bit Pauli channels. For certain codes under the
symmetric depolarizing channel, we use the coding maps to compute exact
threshold error probabilities for achievability of perfect fidelity in the
