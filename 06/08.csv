the range in gas temperature between 3 and 10 keV, with bolometric X-ray
luminosity between 2e44 erg/s and 6e45 erg/s. Using the de-projected gas
temperature and density profiles resolved in a number of bins between 5 and 7
and obtained from this dataset only, we recover the total gravitating mass
profiles for 20 objects just applying the (i) spherical symmetry and (ii)
hydrostatic equilibrium assumptions. We investigate the correlations between
total mass, gas temperature, luminosity at several overdensities values and
find that the slopes of these relations are independent from the considered
overdensity and consistent with what is predicted from the cluster scaling
laws. The best-fit results on the normalization of the M-T relation are
slightly lower, but still consistent considering the large errors that we
measure, with hydrodynamical simulations. A segregation between relaxed and
non-relaxed systems is present in each plane of these relations pointing out to
a significant component in their intrinsic scatter. This segregation becomes
more evident at higher overdensities and when physical quantities, like M_gas
and L, that are direct function of the amount of gas observed, are considered.

at the redshifts of the six intervening OVI absorption systems known from UV
studies. We detect features with >~2-sigma significance at the predicted OVII
and OVIII wavelengths of one OVI system, at the OVII wavelength of a second,
and at the NeIX wavelength of a third. We find two additional features of
comparable strength (one OVII and one OVIII) within 1000 km/s of OVI redshifts.
The 1-sigma constraints in the two detected OVI systems imply gas overdensities
lower than the values delta>100 expected in virialized systems, suggesting that
the absorption arises in lower density, filamentary structures. At the 2-sigma
level, however, the physical constraints are weak. If we treat our 2-sigma
detections of known OVI systems as real, but assume minimal OVII and OVIII in
the other systems, we estimate [f(OVI)+f(OVII)+f(OVIII)]/f(OVI) = 32 +/- 9 for
the average ratio of all highly ionized oxygen species to OVI. Combined with
estimates of the total column density of OVI absorption per unit redshift, this
ratio implies a total baryon fraction associated with detected OVI absorbers
Omega_b(OVI)~0.03/h_70, a substantial fraction of the baryon density predicted
by BBN, and larger than that in known low redshift components. Because of the
limited S/N of the detections, these results must be treated with caution.
Nonetheless, the combination of the OVI data with these X-ray forest
measurements provides the most direct evidence to date for the pervasive,
moderate density, shock-heated intergalactic medium predicted by leading
cosmological scenarios. (Abridged.)

know them from observations, essentially from rotation curves around spiral and
dwarf galaxies. Detailed rotation curves are now known for more than a thousand
galaxies, revealing that they are not so flat in the outer parts, but rising
for late-types, and falling for early-types. A well established result now is
that most bright galaxies are not dominated by dark matter inside their optical
disks. Only for dwarfs and LSB (Low Surface Brightness galaxies) dark matter
plays a dominant role in the visible regions. The 3D-shape of haloes are
investigated through several methods, that will be discussed: polar rings,
flaring of HI planes, X-ray isophotes.
  It is not yet possible with rotation curves to know how far haloes extend,
but tentatives have been made. It will be shown that the dark matter appears to
be coupled to the gas in spirals and dwarfs, suggesting that dark baryons could
play the major role in rotation curves. Theories proposing to replace the
non-baryonic dark matter by a different dynamical or gravity law, such as MOND,
have to take into account the dark baryons, especially since their spatial
distribution is likely to be quite different from the visible matter.

signals the onset of a polaronic crossover whereas the electrons are

occur, emphasizing basic mechanisms in simple contexts. The general mechanism
of charge fractionalization is the passage from states created by local action
of fields to states having a topological character, which permits mixing
between local and topological charges. The primeval case of charge
fractionalization for domain walls, in polyacetylene and more generally, can be
demonstrated convincingly using Schrieffer's intuitive counting argument, and
derived formally from analysis of zero modes and vacuum polarization. An
important generalization realizes chiral fermions on high-dimensional domain
walls, in particular for liquid He3 in the A phase. In two spatial dimensions,
fractionalization of angular momentum and quantum statistics occurs, for
reasons that can be elucidated both abstractly, and specifically in the context

relativity which has not been tested directly so far. The idea of the proposed
gravitational experiment is based on the fact that gravity in general
relativity propagates with finite speed so that the deflection of light caused
by the body must be sensitive to the ratio of the body's velocity to the speed
of gravity. The interferometric experiment can be performed, for example,
during the very close angular passage of a quasar by Jupiter. Due to the finite
speed of gravity and orbital motion of Jupiter, the variation in its
gravitational field reaches observer on Earth not instantaneously but at the
retarded instant of time and should appear as a velocity-dependent excess time
delay in addition to the well-known Shapiro delay, caused by the static part of
the Jupiter's gravitational field. Such Jupiter-QSO encounter events take place
once in a decade. The next such event will occur on September 8, 2002 when
Jupiter will pass by quasar J0842+1835 at the angular distance 3.7 arcminutes.
If radio interferometric measurement of the quasar coordinates in the sky are
done with the precision of a few picoseconds (about 5 microarcseconds) the
effect of retardation of gravity and its speed of propagation may be measured
with an accuracy about 10%.

determine if there is a signal present in instrumental data and how to identify

difficulty identifying sources. A better method must be found. The initial
guess problem involves how to generate {\it a priori} values for the parameters
of a parameter-estimation problem that are close enough to the final values for
a linear least-squares estimator to converge to the correct result. A useful
approach to simultaneously solving the detection and initial guess problems for
LISA is to divide the sky into many pixels and to demodulate the Doppler
spreading for each set of pixel coordinates. The demodulated power spectra may
then be searched for spectral features. We demonstrate that the procedure works
well as a first step in the search for gravitational waves from monochromatic

calculus for gauge theories with, and without, supersymmetry. Particular
emphasis is put on developing a formalism that can deal with any number of
instantons. This necessitates a thorough review of the ADHM construction of
instantons with arbitrary charge and an in-depth analysis of the resulting
moduli space of solutions. We review the construction of the ADHM moduli space
as a hyper-Kahler quotient. We show how the functional integral in the
semi-classical approximation reduces to an integral over the instanton moduli
space in each instanton sector and how the resulting matrix partition function
involves various geometrical quantities on the instanton moduli space: volume
form, connection, curvature, isometries, etc. One important conclusion is that
this partition function is the dimensional reduction of a higher-dimensional
gauged linear sigma model which naturally leads us to describe the relation of
the instanton calculus to D-branes in string theory. Along the way we describe
powerful applications of the calculus of many instantons to supersymmetric
gauge theories including (i) the gluino condensate puzzle in N=1 theories (ii)
Seiberg-Witten theory in N=2 theories; and (iii) the AdS/CFT correspondence in
N=2 and N=4 theories. Finally, we briefly review the modifications of the

homological algebra where one encounters a functor that has both a left and
right adjoint, with the right adjoint being isomorphic to a shift of the left
adjoint specified by an appropriate ``dualizing object''. Typically the left
adjoint is well understood while the right adjoint is more mysterious, and the
result identifies the right adjoint in familiar terms. We give a categorical
discussion of such results. One essential point is to differentiate between the
classical framework that arises in algebraic geometry and a deceptively
similar, but genuinely different, framework that arises in algebraic topology.
Another is to make clear which parts of the proofs of such results are formal.
The analysis significantly simplifies the proofs of particular cases, as we
illustrate in a sequel discussing applications to equivariant stable homotopy
theory.

result obtained in a Wilsonian renormalization-group approach to hidden local
symmetry theory matched to QCD at near the chiral scale in terms of the
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and predict that the vector meson mass in medium
should scale $m_\rho^\star/m_\rho\sim
(\la\bar{q}q\ra^\star/\la\bar{q}q\ra)^{1/2}$ from $n=0$ up to $\sim n=n_0$
(where $n_0$ is nuclear matter density) and then go over to the linear scaling
$m_\rho^\star/m_\rho\sim \la\bar{q}q\ra^\star/\la\bar{q}q\ra$ up to the chiral
transition density $n_c$ at which the mass is to vanish (in the chiral limit)
according to the vector manifestation fixed point. In the regime of the linear
scaling above $n_0$, the (vector) gauge coupling constant should fall linearly
in $\la\bar{q}q\ra^\star$, vanishing at the critical point, with the width of
the vector meson becoming steeply narrower. We suggest the in-medium vector
meson mass, {\em both} parametric and pole, which goes smoothly to zero with
increasing density, to be an order parameter for chiral symmetry restoration.
Some issues related to recent RHIC observations are qualitatively discussed in
the appendices. Our main conclusion that follows from these considerations is
that the movement towards chiral restoration can be reliably described in
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio mean field, with constituent quarks as variables, although
there is probably density discontinuity following chiral restoration.
