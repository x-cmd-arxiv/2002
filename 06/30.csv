provides an observational constraint on the plasma processes that may be
operating within the disk. Here we examine the continual time variation over
the past six years of the total X-ray flux from the microquasar GRS 1915+105.
The application of differencing and rescaling techniques to RXTE/ASM data shows
that the small amplitude fluctuations scale up to 12-17 days. A 17-day
timescale in the X-ray fluctuations corresponds to half the measured binary
orbital period of this system (33.5 +/- 1.5 days). While this may be
coincidental, it is possible that these two timescales may be linked by, for
example, a turbulent cascade in the accretion disk driven by a tidally-induced
two-armed spiral shock corotating with the binary system. Temporal scaling is
found only in the ever-present small fluctuations, and not in the intermittent
larger-amplitude fluctuations. This is consistent with the basic model for this
source which consists of a steady, cold outer disk and an unstable inner disk.

variations. The contribution due to faculae and the network is of basic
importance, but suffers from considerable uncertainty. We determine the
contrasts of active region faculae and the network, both as a function of
heliocentric angle and magnetogram signal. To achieve this, we analyze
near-simultaneous full disk images of photospheric continuum intensity and
line-of-sight magnetic field provided by the Michelson Doppler Interferometer
(MDI) on board the SOHO spacecraft. Starting from the surface distribution of
the solar magnetic field we first construct a mask, which is then used to
determine the brightness of magnetic features, and the relatively field-free
part of the photosphere separately. By sorting the magnetogram signal into
different bins we are able to distinguish between the contrasts of different
concentrations of magnetic field. We find that the contrasts of active region
faculae (large magnetogram signal) and the network (small signal) exhibit a
very different CLV, showing that the populations of magnetic flux tubes are
different. This implies that these elements need to be treated separately when
reconstructing variations of the total solar irradiance with high precision. We
have obtained an analytical expression for the contrast of photospheric
magnetic features as a function of both position on the disk and magnetic field
strength, by performing a 2-dimensional fit to the observations.

reveals two distinct components in the highest redshift system at z1a=1.47590

of the disk of the host galaxy of GRB 010222. The best fitted power-law optical
continuum and [Zn/Cr] ratio imply low dust content or a local gray dust
component near the burst site. In addition, we do not detect strong signatures
of vibrationally excited states of H_2. If the GRB took place in a superbubble
or young stellar cluster, there are no outstanding signatures of an ionized
absorber, either. Analysis of the spectral time dependence at low resolution
shows no significant evidence for absorption-line variability. This lack of
variability is confronted with time-dependent photoionization simulations
designed to apply the observed flux from GRB 010222 to a variety of assumed
atomic gas densities and cloud radii. The absence of time dependence in the
absorption lines implies that high-density environments are disfavored. In
particular, if the GRB environment was dust free, its density was unlikely to
exceed nH=10^2 cm^-3. If depletion of metals onto dust is similar to Galactic
values or less than solar abundances are present, then nH > 2 x 10^4 cm^-3 is
probably ruled out in the immediate vicinity of the burst.

profile grids are produced, at a spatial resolution~0.5"" and spectral

1'' on each side of the central engine along PA=90deg, with a projected
velocity difference of 140km/s: this velocity jump has been interpreted in
Alloin et al (2001) as the signature of a rotating disk of molecular material.
Another knot with both H2 and Bg emission is detected to the North of the
central engine, close to the radio source C where the small scale radio jet is
redirected and close to the brightest [OIII] cloud NLR-B. At the achieved
spectral resolution, the H2 emission line profiles appear highly asymmetric
with their low velocity wing being systematically more extended than their high
velocity wing. A simple way to account for the changes of the H2 line profiles
(peak-shift with respect to the systemic velocity, width, asymmetry) over the
entire 4''x 4'' region, is to consider that a radial outflow is superimposed
over the emission of the rotating molecular disk. We present a model of such a
kinematical configuration and compare our predicted H2 emission profiles to the

groups of galaxies. The X-ray emission is extended over several member
galaxies, and is thus associated with the group rather than an individual

0.08 solar. The gas-to-stellar mass ratio is $\sim0.3$. Although this is
relatively low among groups, the hot gas is also a significant component even

junctions, is extended and used to evaluate the fraction of available energy,

Classical heat conduction theory is then applied to estimate the expected
temperature rise. For a reasonable choice of molecular parameters and for
junctions carrying currents in the nA range, we find the temperature rise to be
a modest few degrees. It is argued, however, that using classical theory to

terms of ""internal clocks"" which effectively measure the interaction time with
internal degrees of freedom of the barrier. It is known that this definition of
the time scale for tunneling is not unique in the sense that it depends on the
clock used to define it. For the case of resonance tunneling, a particular
choice that in the limit of a high/broad square barrier yields the original
result of Buttiker and Landauer (Phys. Rev. Lett. 1982, 49, 1739) is correlated
to the lifetime of the resonance state. This is illustrated for analytically
solvable one-dimensional double barrier models and for a realistic model of
electron tunneling through a static water barrier. The latter calculation
constitutes a novel application of this concept to a 3-dimensional model, and
the observed structure in the energy dependence of the computed traversal time
reflects the existence of transient tunneling resonances associated with
instantaneous water structures. These models, characterized by the existence of
shape resonances in the barrier, make it possible to examine different internal
clocks that were proposed for measuring tunneling times in situations where a
""clock independent"" intrinsic time scale (the resonance life time) for the
tunneling time exists. It is argued that this time may be used in order to
estimate the relative importance of dynamical barrier processes that affect the
tunneling probability.

the direct CP asymmetry will vanish if the new-physics amplitude has the same
strong phase as the standard-model amplitude. We show that this type of new
physics can still be detected via an angular analysis of the sister decay mode
B -> J/Psi K^*. Time-dependent measurements and tagging are not necessary.
Should new physics be found, this angular analysis can be used to obtain
information about the size of the new-physics parameters.

superconductivity has been investigated. It has been found that the effect of
the charge neutrality on a 2-flavor quark system is very different from that on
a 3-flavor system. The BCS diquark pair in 2-flavor color superconducting phase
has been largely reduced by the large Fermi momentum of electron, the diquark
condensate first increases with the increasing of quark's chemical potential
$\mu$,then decreases rapidly and finally disappears at about $\mu=535MeV$, at
which the thermodynamic potential equals to that in the neutral normal 2-flavor
quark matter.

which admit finite matrix approximations (``fuzzy spaces'') with a view to
applications in a modified Kaluza-Klein type approach in which the internal
space consists of a finite number of points. Motivated by the chiral nature of
the standard model spectrum we investigate manifolds that do not admit spinors
but do admit $Spin^c$ structures. It is shown that, by twisting with
appropriate bundles, one generation of the electroweak sector of the standard
model, including a right-handed neutrino, can be obtained in this way from the
complex projective space $\CP^2$. The unitary Grassmannian $U(5)/(U(3)\times
U(2))$ yields a spectrum that contains the correct charges for the Fermions of
the standard model, with varying multiplicities for the different particle
states.
