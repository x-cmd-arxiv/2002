  Accepted for publication in ApJ","Astrophys.J. 584 (2003) 390-398","10.1086/345536",,"astro-ph",,"  We show that the collapsar model of gamma-ray bursts results in a series of
successive shocks and rarefaction waves propagating in the ""cork"" of stellar
material being pushed ahead of the jet, as it emerges from the massive stellar
progenitor. These shocks result in a series of characteristic, increasingly
shorter and harder thermal X-ray pulses, as well as a non-thermal gamma-ray
pulse, which precede the usual non-thermal MeV gamma-rays. We consider jets
escaping from both compact (CO or He dwarf) and blue supergiant stellar
progenitors. The period, fluence and hardness of the pulses serves as a
diagnostic for the size and density of the outer envelope of the progenitor
star.

matter is predicted to appear as the local minima in the excitation functions
of the transverse flow parameter for both neutrons and protons above the pion
production threshold. Because of its {\it qualitative} nature unlike other {\it
quantitative} observables, this precursor can be used as a unique signature of
the isospin dependence of the nuclear {\rm EOS}. Measurements of these
observables will provide the first terrestrial data to constrain stringently
the HD behaviour of nuclear symmetry energy and thus also the {\rm EOS} of
dense neutron-rich matter. Implications of our findings to neutron star studies
are also discussed.
