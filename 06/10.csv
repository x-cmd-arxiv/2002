determination, by virtue of the detection and measurement of the radioactive

however, is that predictions of the production ratio of U and Th have not been
made in the context of a realistic astrophysical model of the $r$-process. We
have endeavored to produce such a model, based on the ``neutrino winds'' that
are expected to arise from the nascent neutron star of a core-collapse
supernova. The mass-integrated $r$-process yields, obtained by assuming a
simple time evolution of the neutrino luminosity, are compared to the available
spectroscopic elemental abundance data of CS 31082-001. As a result, the
``age'' of this star is determined to be $14.1 \pm 2.5$ Gyr, in excellent
agreement with lower limits on the age of the universe estimated by other
dating techniques, as well as with other stellar radioactive age estimates.
Future measurements of Pt and Pb in this star, as well as expansion of searches
for additional $r$-process-enhanced, metal-poor stars (especially those in
which both U and Th are measurable), are of special importance to constrain the

from S(7) to S(0) are detected in both Starbursts and Seyferts. Using
excitation diagrams we derive temperatures and masses of the ``warm'' molecular
hydrogen. We find that the temperature of the ``warm'' gas is similar in
Starbursts and Seyferts (those Seyferts for which we have firm detections of
the S(0) line) with a value of around T~150 K. This ``warm'' gas accounts for
as much as 10% of the total galactic mass (as probed by CO molecular
observations) in Starbursts. The fraction of ``warm'' gas is overall higher in
Seyferts, ranging between 2--35%. We then investigate the origin of the warm
H_2 emission. Comparison with published theoretical models and Galactic
templates implies that although emission from photodissociation regions (PDR)
alone could explain the emission from Starbursts and Seyferts, most likely a
combination of PDR, shock emission and gas heated by X-rays (mostly for the
Seyferts) is responsible for H_2 excitation in extragalactic environments.
Finally, we find that although PAH and H_2 line emission correlate well in
Starbursts and the large scale emission in AGN, H_2 emission is much stronger
compared to PAH emission in cases where a ``pure'' AGN dominates the energy

associated to a density discontinuity that would affect the frequency spectrum
of the non-radial oscillation modes in two ways. Firstly, it would produce a
softening of the equation of state, leading to more compact equilibrium
configurations and changing the frequency of the fundamental and pressure modes
of the neutron star. Secondly, a new non-zero frequency g-- mode would appear,
associated to each discontinuity. These discontinuity g--modes have typical
frequencies larger than those of g--modes previously studied in the literature
(thermal, core g-- modes, or g--modes due to chemical inhomogeneities in the
outer layers), and smaller than that of the fundamental mode; therefore they
should be distinguishable from the other modes of non radial oscillation. In
this paper we investigate how high density discontinuities change the frequency
spectrum of the non-radial oscillations, in the framework of the general
relativistic theory of stellar perturbations. Our purpose is to understand
whether a gravitational signal, emitted at the frequencies of the quasi normal
modes, may give some clear information on the equation of state of the neutron
star and, in particular, on the parameters that characterize the density
discontinuity. We discuss some astrophysical processes that may be associated
to the excitation of these modes, and estimate how much gravitational energy

be very close to the solar abundance pattern, and thus may be used as an

south, both at zero degrees declination, and one area in the north at higher
declination. Each of these areas covers a wide range of survey longitude but a
narrow range of survey latitude, allowing the two dimensional genus to be
measured.
  The genus curves of the SDSS sub-samples are similar, after appropriately
normalizing these measurements for the different areas. We sum the genus curves
from the three areas to obtain the total genus curve of the SDSS. The total
curve has a shape similar to the genus curve derived from mock catalogs drawn
from the Hubble Volume Lambda CDM simulation and is similar to that of a
Gaussian random field. Likewise, comparison with the genus of the 2dFGRS, after
normalization for the difference in area, reveals remarkable similarity in the

essentially a split by morphology (Strateva et al. 2001). We find that the

differential equations expressed in terms of moments of local and global
variables. Our DMF theory, which assumes weak noises and the Gaussian
distribution of state variables, goes beyond weak couplings among constituent
neurons. By using the expression for the firing probability due to an applied
single spike, we have discussed effects of noises, synaptic couplings and the
size of the ensemble on the spike timing precision, which is shown to be
improved by increasing the size of the neuron ensemble, even when there are no
couplings among neurons. When the coupling is introduced, neurons in ensembles
respond to an input spike with a partial synchronization. DMF theory is
extended to a large cluster which can be divided into multiple sub-clusters
according to their functions. A model calculation has shown that when the noise
intensity is moderate, the spike propagation with a fairly precise timing is
possible among noisy sub-clusters with feed-forward couplings, as in the
synfire chain. Results calculated by our DMF theory are nicely compared to
those obtained by direct simulations. A comparison of DMF theory with the
conventional moment method is also discussed.

perturbations which render a given dynamical system stochastically unstable.
The stochastic instability of quasi-isolated systems is responsible for the

(PDE) are first used as a substitute of the scale parameter in the DFW

problems. It is noted that the recursive multiple reciprocity formulation is
the DFW series. The Green second identity is used to avoid the singularity of
the zero-order fundamental solution in creating the DFW series. The fundamental
solutions of various composite PDEs are found very flexible and efficient to
handle a borad range of problems. We also discuss the underlying connections
between the crucial concepts of dimension, scale and the order of PDE through
the analysis of dissipative acoustic wave propagation. The shape parameter of
the potential problems is also employed as the ""scale parameter"" to create the
non-orthogonal DFW. This paper also briefly discusses and conjectures the DFW
correspondences of a variety of coordinate variable transforms and series.
Practically important, the anisotropic and inhomogeneous DFW's are developed by
using the geodesic distance variable. The DFW and the related basis functions
are also used in making the kernel distance sigmoidal functions, which are
potentially useful in the artificial neural network and machine learning. As or
even worse than the preceding two reports, this study scarifies mathematical
rigor and in turn unfetter imagination. Most results are intuitively obtained
without rigorous analysis. Follow-up research is still under way. The paper is

cover the whole extent of radius from spatial infinity down to the horizon.

function of the universe, and find that tunneling in quantum cosmology is quite
different from that in quantum mechanics. Namely, the matter degree of freedom
gets excited under the barrier, provided its interaction with the scale factor
is not too weak, and makes a strong back reaction onto tunneling. In the
semiclassical limit of small values of cosmological constant, the matter energy
behind the barrier is close to the height of the barrier: the system ``climbs
up'' the barrier, and then evolves classically from its top. These features are
even more pronounced for inhomogeneous modes of matter field. Extrapolating to
field theory we thus argue that high momentum particles are copiously created

of the S0 into an arbitrary combination of hadrons, leptons, photons and

in terms of a scale factor k with respect to the Standrad Model cross section

interpreted in general scenarios independently of the decay modes of the S0.
The examples considered here are the production of a single new scalar particle

confinement phase close to the deconfinement phase transition are subjected to
cooling. The aim is to identify long-living, almost-classical local excitations
which carry (generically non-integer) topological charge. Two kinds of spatial
boundary conditions (fixed holonomy and standard periodic boundary conditions)
are applied. For the lowest-action almost-classical configurations we find that
their relative probability semi-quantitatively agrees for both types of
boundary conditions. We find calorons with unit topological charge as well as
(anti-)selfdual lumps (BPS-monopoles or dyons) combined in pairs of non-integer
(equal or opposite sign) topological charge. For calorons and separated pairs
of equal-sign dyons obtained by cooling we have found that (i) the gluon field
is well-described by Kraan-van Baal solutions of the Euclidean Yang-Mills field
equations and (ii) the lowest Wilson-fermion modes are well-described by
analytic solutions of the corresponding Dirac equation. For metastable
configurations found at higher action, the multi-center structure can be
interpreted in terms of dyons and antidyons, using the gluonic and fermionic
indicators as in the dyon-pair case. Additionally, the Abelian monopole
structure and field strength correlators between the centers are useful to
analyse the configurations in terms of dyonic constituents. We argue that a
semi-classical approximation of the non-zero temperature path integral should
be built on superpositions of solutions with non-trivial holonomy.

of QCD. The perturbative calculations are performed in 1-4-loop approximation.
The analytical properties of the polarization operators are used in the whole
complex q^2 plane. It is shown that the QCD prediction for R_{tau} agrees with
the measured value R_{tau} not only for conventional Lambda^{conv}_3 =
(618+-29) MeV but as well as for Lambda^{new}_3 = (1666+-7) MeV. The
polarization operator calculated using the renormgroup has nonphysical cut
[-Lambda^2_3, 0]. If Lambda_3 = Lambda^{conv}_3, the contribution of only
physical cut is deficient in the explanation of the ALEPH experiment. If
Lambda_3 = Lambda^{new}_3 the contribution of nonphysical cut is very small and
only the physical cut explains the ALEPH experiment. The new sum rules which
follow only from analytical properties of polarization operators are obtained.
Basing on the sum rules obtained, it is shown that there is an essential
disagreement between QCD perturbation theory and the tau-lepton hadronic decay
experiment at conventional value Lambda_3. In the evolution upwards to larger
energies the matching of r(q^2) (Eq.(12)) at the masses J/psi, Upsilon and 2m_t
was performed. The obtained value alpha_s(-m^2_z) = 0.141+-0.004 (at Lambda_3 =

neighborhood of an end of an infinite cyclic covering of a compact manifold. We
consider a class of exponentially weighted inner products (\cdot ,\cdot)_k on

d+\delta_k is Fredholm on the weighted spaces for all sufficiently large k. The
index of its restriction to even forms is the Euler characteristic of M. This
result is generalized as follows. Let \pi =\pi_1(M) . Take d+\delta_k with
coefficients in the canonical C^{*}(\pi) -bundle \psi over M. If the chains of

possess the same structure to those of FI CCDs. Since X-ray photons enter from
the back surface of the CCD, a primary charge cloud is formed far from the
electrodes. The primary charge cloud expands through diffusion process until it
reaches the potential well that is just below the electrodes. Therefore, the
diffusion time for the charge cloud produced is longer than that in the FI CCD,
resulting a larger charge cloud shape expected.
  The mesh experiment enables us to specify the X-ray point of interaction with
a subpixel resolution. We then have measured a charge cloud shape produced in
the BI CCD. We found that there are two components of the charge cloud shape
having different size: a narrow component and a broad component. The size of
the narrow component is $2.8-5.7 \mu$m in unit of a standard deviation and
strongly depends on the attenuation length in Si of incident X-rays. The
shorter the attenuation length of X-rays is, the larger the charge cloud
becomes. This result is qualitatively consistent with a diffusion model inside
the CCD. On the other hand, the size of the broad component is roughly constant
of $\simeq 13 \mu$m and does not depend on X-ray energies. Judging from the
design value of the CCD and the fraction of each component, we conclude that
the narrow component is originated in the depletion region whereas the broad
component is in the field-free region.

the molecule inside the helium droplet can be determined by a microscopic
two-fluid model in which helium densities computed by path integral Monte Carlo
are used as input, as well as by direct computation of excited energy levels.

excitation energies is then mandatory. Quantitative studies for three molecules

conditions and point out that, contrary to a recent claim, there is no
inconsistency if the correct orthogonality condition is used for the class of
pseudo-Hermitian, PT-symmetric Hamiltonians of the type $H_{\beta} = [p + {\rm
i} \beta \nu(x)]^2/2m + V(x)$.

(discrete) mass spectrum of elementary or hypothetical particles, it was
possible to construct a non-trivial algebra G containing a Poincare algebra P
as a subalgebra so that the mass operator, defined throughout the space where
one of the irreducible representations G is given, is self-conjugate and its
spectrum coincides with the given mass spectrum. Such an algebra was
constructed in explicit form for the nonrelativistic case, i.e., the generators
were written for the algebra. However, the problem of how to assign the algebra
G constructively and determine an explicit form of the mass operator in the
relativistic case has remained unsolved. In the present work we present a
solution of this problem, construct continuum analogs of the classical algebras
U(N) and Sp(2N), and show that the problem of including the Poincare algebra
can be formulated in the language of wave function equations.

is taken as the translation generator P_4 of the inhomogenous De Sitter group.
The classification of representations of the algebra P(1,4) of this group is
performed and the corresponding P(1,4) invariant equations for variable-mass
particles are written out. In this way we have succeeded, in particular, in
uniting the ``external'' and ``internal'' (SU_2) symmetries in a non-trivial
fashion.
