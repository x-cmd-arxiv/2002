from cosmic ray experiments and for planning the layout of new detectors. They
are used to estimate the energy and mass of the primary particle. Unfortunately
the model uncertainties translate directly into systematic errors in the energy
and mass determination. Aiming at energies $> 10^{19}$ eV, the models have to
be extrapolated far beyond the energies available at accelerators. On the other
hand, hybrid measurement of ground particle densities and calorimetric shower
energy, as will be provided by the Pierre Auger Observatory, will strongly
constrain shower models. While the main uncertainty of contemporary models
comes from our poor knowledge of the (soft) hadronic interactions at high
energies, also electromagnetic interactions, low-energy hadronic interactions
and the particle transport influence details of the shower development. We
review here the physics processes and some of the computational techniques of
air shower models presently used for highest energies, and discuss the
properties and limitations of the models.

of mergers exceeds ~80, merger-only models with less than ~20 mergers, and

in pure CO icy grain mantles. This is the first detection of solid 13CO in the
interstellar medium. The 13CO band is a factor of 2.3 narrower than the apolar
component of the 12CO band. With this in mind, we discuss the mechanisms that
broaden solid state absorption bands. It is shown that ellipsoidally shaped
pure CO grains fit the bands of both isotopes at the same time. Reasonable fits
are also obtained by CO embedded in N2-rich ices and thermally processed
O2-rich ices. In addition, we report new insights into the the nature and
evolution of interstellar CO ices by comparing the high quality multi-component
solid 12CO spectrum of NGC 7538 : IRS9 with that of the previously studied low
mass source L1489 IRS. The narrow absorption by apolar CO ices is present in
both spectra, but much stronger in NGC 7538. It is superposed on a smooth broad
absorption feature well fitted by a combination of CO2 and H2O-rich laboratory
CO ices. The abundances of the latter two ices relative to the total H2O ice
column are the same in both sources. We thus suggest that thermal processing
manifests itself as evaporation of apolar ices only, and not the formation of
CO2 or polar ices. Finally, the decomposition of the 12CO band is used to
derive the 12CO/13CO abundance ratio in apolar ices. A ratio of 71+/-15 is
deduced, in good agreement with gas phase CO studies (~77) and the solid
12CO2/13CO2 ratio of 80+/-11 found in the same line of sight. The implications
for the chemical path along which CO2 is formed are discussed.

spatially resolved spectral data of the EPIC MOS and pn CCDs reveals that a
two-temperature model (2T) of the hot gas is favored over single-phase and
cooling flow models within the central ~20 kpc. The preference for the 2T model
applies whether or not the data are deprojected. The cooler component has a
temperature (~0.9 keV) similar to the kinetic temperature of the stars while
the hotter component has a temperature (~1.5 keV) characteristic of the virial
temperature of a ~10^{13} M_sun halo. The two-phase model (and other
multitemperature models) removes the ``Fe Bias'' within r < ~20 kpc and gives
Z_Fe/Z_sun 1.5-2. At larger radii the iron abundance decreases until Z_Fe/Z_sun
\~0.5 for r ~50 kpc. The Si abundance is super-solar (1.2-1.7 solar) within the
central regions while Z_Si/Z_Fe ~0.8 over the entire region studied. These Fe
and Si abundances imply that ~80% of the Fe mass within r ~50 kpc originates
from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). This SNIa fraction is similar to that inferred
for the Sun and therefore suggests a stellar initial mass function similar to
the Milky Way.

radiation ahead of the blast wave. In fact, the blast wave is dramatically
influenced by the leading gamma-ray front which preaccelerates the ambient
medium and loads it with electron-positron pairs. The front sweeps the medium
outward with a high Lorentz factor and results in a spectacular effect: the GRB
ejecta moves freely in a cavity behind its own radiation front. When the front
expands sufficiently and gets diluted, a blast wave develops, and it does it
differently from the standard model used before. The afterglow should initially
appear as a steep rise of soft emission (from infrared to soft X-rays) at a
time comparable to the prompt GRB duration and then the emission should quickly
evolve to a normal X-ray afterglow. This may explain the prompt optical flash
observed in GRB 990123 and allows one to infer the ejecta Lorentz factor in
this burst: \Gamma=200. The effect of the gamma-ray front on the afterglow
emission is especially pronounced if the GRB has a massive progenitor and the
blast wave propagates in the progenitor wind. We emphasize the importance of
early afterglow observations in soft bands, as they will allow one to test
different progenitor models.

profiles is complicated by the unknown residual accretion luminosity and lack
of coverage of the high Balmer lines. Our best-fit model atmospheres are

approach makes use of observational estimates of the opacities of hydrogen and
singly ionised helium in the intergalactic medium during this epoch. In
particular, we model the reionisation of He II by sources of hard ultraviolet
radiation, i.e. quasars, and infer values for our parameterisation of this

account for the measured opacity of the H I Lyman-alpha forest at a redshift z
3. This motivates us to include a soft, stellar component to the ionising

negligible impact on the He II opacity. In order to simultaneously match

considered under different regimes. Using analytical and numerical analysis, we
show that even for small hopping constant and weak electron-phonon interaction,
the original discrete Wannier-Stark (WS) ladder electronic states are each
replaced by a semi-continuous band if a resonance condition is satisfied
between the phonon frequency and the ladder spacing. In this regime, the
original localized WS states can become {\em delocalized}, yielding both
`tunneling' and `stretched' polarons. The transport properties of such a system
would exhibit a modulation of the phonon replicas in typical tunneling
experiments. The modulation will reflect the complex spectra with
nearly-fractal structure of the semi-continuous band. In the off-resonance
regime, the WS ladder is strongly deformed, although the states are still
localized to a degree which depends on the detuning: Both the spacing between
the levels in the deformed ladder and the localization length of the resulting
eigenfunctions can be adjusted by the applied electric field. We also discuss
the regime beyond small hopping constant and weak coupling, and find an
interesting mapping to that limit via the Lang-Firsov transformation, which
allows one to extend the region of validity of the analysis.

asymptotically close to the Theta point. We incorporate the effects of critical

discus an interesting case that is based in almost zero permeability at a given

problem of left handed materials, and constitutes a material that acts a band
pass filter with a very narrow band. The metamaterials claimed to present
negative refraction are just showing this effect. However, absorption can be
diminished in those metamaterials by using thicker wires. Materials based in
quasi metallic magnetic structures are proposed with ferromagnetic resonance at
microwave frequencies under applied magnetic fields. These materials, as well

The foam was made in the nematic phase ($\textrm{T} = 35 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}$)
by bubbling nitrogen through the pure liquid crystal. The coarsening behavior
was investigated at three temperatures; at $\textrm{T} = 22 ^{\circ}\textrm{C}$
and $33^{\circ}\textrm{C}$ in the smectic phase and at $\textrm{T} =
34^{\circ}\textrm{C}$ in the nematic phase. In smectic and nematic phases the
mean bubble radius $<R>$ has been measured as a function of time $<R > \sim
t^{\lambda}$. In classical wet soap foams the growth exponent is typically
$\lambda \approx 0.33$ where coarsening is by gas diffusion from bubbles with
high curvature to bubbles with low curvature. In liquid crystal foams a growth
exponent, $\lambda = 0.20 \pm 0.05$ is observed. This may be explained by the
presence of defects at the surface of the bubbles which slow down the
coarsening behaviour. This growth exponent can be observed in both nematic and
smectic phases. At higher temperatures typically $>35^{\circ}\textrm{C}$
coalescence dominates the coarsening behaviour. In the isotropic state,
$>41.5^{\circ}\textrm{C}$, the foam is rapidly unstable.

received much attention. Initial efforts produced ""optimal"" trees based on

SMPs and wide-area ""computational Grids,"" with the result that collective
operations perform suboptimally. In response, more recent work has focused on
creating topology-aware trees for collective operations that minimize
communication across slower channels (e.g., a wide-area network). While these
efforts have significant communication benefits, they all limit their view of
the network to only two layers. We present a strategy based upon a multilayer
view of the network. By creating multilevel topology-aware trees we take
advantage of communication cost differences at every level in the network. We
used this strategy to implement topology-aware versions of several MPI
collective operations in MPICH-G2, the Globus Toolkit[tm]-enabled version of
the popular MPICH implementation of the MPI standard. Using information about
topology provided by MPICH-G2, we construct these multilevel topology-aware
trees automatically during execution. We present results demonstrating the
advantages of our multilevel approach by comparing it to the default

a limit of the non-linear evolution equation valid in the tail of the hadron

neglect all the relative terms of the order $\sim\lambda^{4}$ and higher.

central role. Horizon cusps do not appear as precursors to black hole merger. A

the first homology group of the the unique infinite cyclic covering space of
S^3-K, considered as a module over the (commutative) Laurent polynomial ring,
and the Blanchfield linking pairing defined on this module. From the
perspective of the knot group, G, these invariants reflect the structure of
G^(1)/G^(2) as a module over G/G^(1) (here G^(n) is the n-th term of the
derived series of G). Hence any phenomenon associated to G^(2) is invisible to
abelian invariants. This paper begins the systematic study of invariants
associated to solvable covering spaces of knot exteriors, in particular the
study of what we call the n-th higher-order Alexander module, G^(n+1)/G^(n+2),
considered as a Z[G/G^(n+1)$-module. We show that these modules share almost
all of the properties of the classical Alexander module. They are torsion
modules with higher-order Alexander polynomials whose degrees give lower bounds
for the knot genus. The modules have presentation matrices derived either from
a group presentation or from a Seifert surface. They admit higher-order linking
forms exhibiting self-duality. There are applications to estimating knot genus
and to detecting fibered, prime and alternating knots. There are also
surprising applications to detecting symplectic structures on 4-manifolds.
These modules are similar to but different from those considered by the author,
Kent Orr and Peter Teichner and are special cases of the modules considered
subsequently by Shelly Harvey for arbitrary 3-manifolds.

excited heavy nuclei, a popular practice is to parametrise the yields of
isotopes as a function of temperature in the form
$Y(z)=z^{-\tau}f(z^{\sigma}(T-T_0))$, where $Y(z)$'s are the measured yields
and $\tau, \sigma$ and $T_0$ are fitted to the yields. Here $T_0$ would be
interpreted as the phase transition temperature. For finite systems such as
those obtained in nuclear collisions, this parametrisation is only approximate
and hence allows for extraction of $T_0$ in more than one way. In this work we
look in detail at how values of $T_0$ differ, depending on methods of
extraction. It should be mentioned that for finite systems, this approximate
parametrisation works not only at the critical point, but also for first order
phase transitions (at least in some models). Thus the approximate fit is no
guarantee that one is seeing a critical phenomenon. A different but more
conventional search for the nuclear phase transition would look for a maximum
in the specific heat as a function of temperature $T_2$. In this case $T_2$ is
interpreted as the phase transition temperature. Ideally $T_0$ and $T_2$ would
coincide. We invesigate this possibility, both in theory and from the ISiS
data, performing both canonical ($T$) and microcanonical ($e=E^*/A$)
calculations. Although more than one value of $T_0$ can be extracted from the
approximate parmetrisation, the work here points to the best value from among
the choices. Several interesting results, seen in theoretical calculations, are
borne out in experiment.

  Relations over a Finite Field","16 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Using the Weyl commutation relations over a finite field we introduce a
family of error-correcting quantum stabilizer codes based on a class of
symmetric matrices over the finite field satisfying certain natural conditions.
When the field is GF(2) the existence of a rich class of such symmetric
matrices is demonstrated by a simple probabilistic argument depending on the
Chernoff bound for i.i.d symmetric Bernoulli trials. If, in addition, these
symmetric matrices are assumed to be circulant it is possible to obtain
concrete examples by a computer program. The quantum codes thus obtained admit
elegant encoding circuits.

  (July 2002)","Found.Phys.Lett. 15 (2002) 1-25",,,"quant-ph gr-qc hep-th",,"  The present standard interpretation of quantum mechanics invokes nonlocality
and state reduction at space-like separated points during measurements on
entangled systems. While there is no understanding of the physical mechanism of
such nonlocal state reduction, the experimental verifications of quantum
correlations different from that predicted by local realistic theories have
polarized the physicists' opinion in favour of nonlocality. I show conclusively
that there is no such spooky state reduction, vindicating the strong views
against nonlocality held by Einstein and Popper. Experimental support to this
proof is also discussed. The Bell's inequalities arise due to ignoring the
phase information in the correlation function and not due to nonlocality. This
result goes against the current belief of quantum nonlocality held by the
majority of physicists; yet the proof is transparent and rigorous, and
therefore demands a change in the interpretation of quantum mechanics and
quantum measurements. The hypothesis of wave function collapse is inconsistent
with experimental observations on entangled correlated systems.

The new results are introduced concerning self-adjoint extensions of operators
describing the free particle on a pointed plane as well as the role played by
discrete symmetries in the analysis of such extensions.

which are interacting by a simplified s-wave scattering. We show, that the
dynamically created entanglement changes in a steplike manner. Moreover, we
introduce local operators which allow us to violate a Bell-CHSH inequality
adapted to the continuous variable case. The correlations show nonclassical
behavior and almost reach the maximal quantum mechanical value. This is
interesting since the states prepared by this interaction are very different
from any EPR-like state.

model of the game interaction is constructed on the basis of a non-distributive

by the use of probability amplitudes according to the rules of quantum
mechanics. A scheme of quantization of the payoff function is proposed and an
algorithm for the search of Nash equilibrium is given. It is shown that
differently from the classical case in the quantum situation a discrete set of
equilibrium is possible.
