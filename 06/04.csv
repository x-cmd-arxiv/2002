recent models for star forming galaxies. We model the IR emission with our
population synthesis code, GRASIL (Silva et al. 1998). As for the radio
emission, we revisit the simple model of Condon & Yin (1990). We find that a
tightFIR/Radio correlation is natural when the synchrotron mechanism dominates
over the inverse Compton, and the electrons cooling time is shorter than the
fading time of the supernova rate. Observations indicate that both these
conditions are met in star forming galaxies. However since the radio non
thermal emission is delayed, deviations are expected both in the early phases
of a starburst, when the radio thermal component dominates, and in the
post-starburst phase, when the bulk of the NT component originates from less
massive stars. This delay allows the analysis of obscured starbursts with a
time resolution of a few tens of Myrs, unreachable with other star formation
indicators. We suggest to complement the analysis of the deviations from the
FIR/Radio correlation with the radio slope to obtain characteristic parameters
of the burst. The analysis of a sample of compact ULIRGs shows that they are
intense but transient starbursts, to which one should not apply usual SF
indicators devised for constant SF rates. We also discuss the possibility of
using the q- radio slope diagram to asses the presence of obscured AGN. A firm
prediction of the models is an apparent radio excess during the post-starburst
phase, which seems to be typical of a class of star forming galaxies in rich
cluster cores. We discuss how deviations from the correlation, due to the
evolutionary status of the starburst, affect the technique of photometric
redshift determination widely used for high-z sources.

have a comparable column density. The total pressure in clouds of such a column
density is P/k~10^8-10^9 K cm^-3, far greater than that in the diffuse ISM or
the average in GMCs. Observations show that massive star-forming regions are
supersonically turbulent, and we show that the molecular cores out of which
individual massive stars form are as well. The protostellar accretion rate in
such a core is approximately equal to the instantaneous mass of the star
divided by the free-fall time of the gas that is accreting onto the star
(Stahler, Shu, & Taam 1980). The star-formation time in this Turbulent Core
model for massive star formation is several mean free-fall timesscales of the
core, but is about equal to that of the region in which the core is embedded.
The typical time for a massive star to form is about 10^5 yr and the accretion
rate is high enough to overcome radiation pressure due to the luminosity of the
star. For the typical case we consider, in which the cores out of which the
stars form have a density structure varying as r^{-1.5}, the protostellar
accretion rate grows linearly with time. We calculate the evolution of the
radius of a protostar and determine the accretion luminosity. At the high
accretion rates that are typical in regions of massive star formation,
protostars join the main sequence at about 20 solar masses. We apply these
results to predict the properties of protostars thought to be powering several

  Conference Series, edited by J. M. De Buizer",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We suggest that molecular cloud (MC) turbulence is a consequence of the very
process of MC formation by collisions of larger-scale flows in the diffuse
atomic gas, which generate turbulence in the accumulated gas through bending-
mode instabilities. Turbulence is thus maintained for as long as the
accumulation process lasts ($\sim$ several Myr). Assuming that supersonic
turbulence in MCs has the double role of preventing global collapse while
promoting the formation of smaller-scale structures by turbulent compression
(``turbulent fragmentation''), we then note the following properties: a)
Turbulent fragmentation necessarily deposits progressively smaller fractions of
the total mass in regions of progressively smaller sizes, because the smaller
structures are subsets of the larger ones. b) The turbulent spectrum implies
that smaller scales have smaller velocity differences. Therefore, below some
scale, denoted $l_{\rm eq}$, the turbulent motions become subsonic. This is an
energy {\it distribution} phenomenon, not a dissipative one. On this basis, we
propose that the star formation efficiency (SFE) is determined by the fraction
of the total mass that is deposited in clumps with masses larger than $M_{\rm
J}(l_{\rm eq})$, the Jeans mass at scale $l_{\rm eq}$, because subsonic
turbulence cannot promote any further subfragmentation. In this scenario, the
SFE should be a monotonically increasing function of the sonic and turbulent
equality scale, $l_{\rm eq}$. We present preliminary numerical tests supporting
this prediction, and thus the suggestion that (one of the) relevant
parameter(s) is $l_{\rm eq}$, and compare with previous proposals that the
relevant parameter is the energy injection scale.

sources in the low-redshift universe also produce non-Gaussianity, so do
foreground emissions from extragalactic or interstellar microwave sources. We
study how well we can measure these non-Gaussian signals, including the

bispectrum to be detected by any experiments; thus, any detection strongly
constrains this class of models. We also find that the secondary bispectrum
from coupling between the SZ effect and the weak lensing effect, and the
foreground bispectrum from extragalactic point sources, give detectable
non-Gaussian signals on small angular scales. We test Gaussianity of the COBE
DMR sky maps, by measuring all the modes of the angular bispectrum down to the
DMR beam size. We find no significant signal of the bispectrum. We also find
that the previously reported detection of the bispectrum is consistent with a
statistical fluctuation. By fitting the theoretical prediction to the data for
the primary bispectrum, we put a constraint on non-linearity in inflation. We
conclude that the angular bispectrum finds no significant non-Gaussian signals

lift degeneracies in the supersymmetric (SUSY) parameter space. We show that by
combining the observations of different mass clumps, ACTs can explore most of

their core- and half-light radii, central surface brightness, and central

molecular cores which are subjected to an increase in external pressure $P\xt$.
If $P\xt$ increases very slowly, the core approaches instability quite
quasistatically. However, for larger (but still quite modest) $dP\xt/dt$ a
compression wave is driven into the core, thereby triggering collapse from the
outside in. If collapse of a core is induced by increasing $P\xt$, this has a
number of interesting consequences. (i) The density profile is approximately
flat in the centre during the prestellar phase (i.e. before the compression
wave converges on the centre creating the central protostar). (ii) During the
prestellar phase there are (subsonic) inward velocities in the outer layers of
the core, whilst the inner parts are still approximately at rest. (iii) There
is an initial short phase of rapid accretion (notionally the Class 0 phase),
followed by a longer phase of slower accretion (the Class I phase). All these
features accord well with observation, but are at variance with the predictions
of the standard theory of star formation based on the inside-out collapse of a
singular isothermal sphere. We note that the setting up of a coherent inward
velocity field appears to be a generic feature of compression waves; and we
speculate that interactions and interference between such velocity fields may
play a crucial r\^ole in initiating the fragmentation of cores and the genesis
of multiple star systems.

we applied to the known massive star populations in Cygnus. For all OB
associations and young open clusters in the field, we determined the population
age, distance, and richness as well as the uncertainties in all these
quantities from published photometric and spectroscopic data. We propagate the
population uncertainties in model uncertainties by means of a Bayesian method.
The young globular cluster Cyg OB2 turns out to be the dominant 26Al
nucleosynthesis and ionisation source in Cygnus. Our model reproduces the
ionising luminosity of the Cygnus region very well, yet it underestimates 26Al
production by about a factor of 2. We attribute this underestimation to
shortcomings of current nucleosynthesis models, and suggest the inclusion of
stellar rotation as possible mechanism to enhance 26Al production. We also
modelled 60Fe nucleosynthesis in the Cygnus region, yet the small number of
recent supernova events suggests only little 60Fe production. Consequently, a

  estimating dust depletion effects","Accepted in Astronomy & Astrophysics, 10 pages, 3 figures",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20020822",,"astro-ph",,"  A new method is presented for recovering the abundances of Damped Ly alpha
systems (DLAs) taking into account the effects of dust depletion. For the first
time, possible variations of the chemical composition of the dust are taken
into account in estimating the depletions. No prior assumptions on the
extinction properties of the dust are required. The method requires a set of
abundances measured in the gas and a set of parameters describing the chemical
properties of the dust. A large subset of these parameters is determined from
interstellar observations; the others are free parameters for which an educated
guess can be made. The method is able to recover the abundances of the SMC
starting from SMC interstellar measurements apparently discrepant from the
stellar ones. Application of the method to 22 DLAs with available [Fe/H] and
[Si/Fe] measurements gives the following results: (1) the mean metallicity of
the corrected data is <[Fe/H]> ~ -1.0 dex, about 0.5 dex higher than that of
the original data; (2) the slope of the [Fe/H] versus redshift relation is
steeper for the corrected data (m ~ -0.3 dex) than for the original ones (m ~
-0.2 dex); (3) the corrected [Si/Fe] ratios are less enhanced, on average, than
those found in Galactic stars of similar, low metallicity; (4) a decrease of
the [Si/Fe] versus [Fe/H] ratios, expected by ""time delay"" models of chemical
evolution, is found for the corrected data; (5) the [Si/Fe] ratios tend to
increase with redshift once corrected; (6) consistency between [Si/Fe] and
[S/Zn] measurements, two independent estimators of the alpha/Fe ratio, is found
only for the corrected abundances.

template fitting for X-ray luminous objects, using a sample of 65 sources
detected by Chandra in the field of the Caltech Faint Galaxy Redshift Survey
(CFGRS). We find that sources with quasar-dominated spectra (for which galaxy
spectral templates are not appropriate) are easily identified, and that
photometric redshifts are robust for the rest of the sources in our sample.
Specifically, for the 59 sources that are not quasar-dominated at optical
wavelengths, we find that the photometric redshift estimates have scatter
comparable to the field galaxy population in this region. There is no evidence
for a trend of increasing dispersion with X-ray luminosity over the range L_X =
10^39 - 5x10^43 erg/s, nor is there a trend with the ratio of X-ray to optical
flux, f_X/f_R. The practical implication of this work is that photometric
redshifts should be robust for the majority (~90%) of the X-ray sources down to
f_X ~ 10^-16 erg/s/cm^2 that have optical counterparts brighter than R ~ 24.
Furthermore, the same photometry can be easily used to identify the sources for
which the photometric redshifts are likely to fail. Photometric redshift
estimation can thus be utilized as an efficient tool in analyzing the
statistical properties of upcoming large Chandra and XMM-Newton data sets and
identifying interesting subsamples for further study.

test different formation scenarios for PRGs, proposed by different authors in
the last decades, by comparing their predictions with these new data. The
strategy is twofold: i) the integrated colors of the main components in these
systems are compared with those of standard morphological galaxy types, to
investigate whether differences in colors are caused by dust absorption or
difference in stellar populations. We then derived an estimate of the stellar
population ages in PRGs, which can be used to set constrains on the dynamical
modeling and the time evolution of these systems; ii) we analyse the structural
parameters of the host galaxy in order to understand whether this component is
a standard early-type system as its morphology suggests, and the light
distribution in the polar ring to measure its radial extension. These
observational results indicate that the global properties of PRGs are better
explained by dissipative merging of disks with un-equal masses as proposed by
Bekki (1998), rather than the accretion-or stripping-of gas by a pre-existing
early-type galaxy.

resistivity increases linearly with H with a coefficient which is far larger

morphology. Lotufo et al. published a principle of the watershed computation by
means of an Image Foresting Transform (IFT), which computes a shortest path
forest from given markers. The algorithm itself was described for a 2D case
(image) without a detailed discussion of its computation and memory demands for
real datasets. As IFT cleverly solves the problem of plateaus and as it gives
precise results when thin objects have to be segmented, it is obvious to use
this algorithm for 3D datasets taking in mind the minimizing of a higher memory
consumption for the 3D case without loosing low asymptotical time complexity of
O(m+C) (and also the real computation speed). The main goal of this paper is an
implementation of the IFT algorithm with a priority queue with buckets and
careful tuning of this implementation to reach as minimal memory consumption as
possible.
  The paper presents five possible modifications and methods of implementation
of the IFT algorithm. All presented implementations keep the time complexity of
the standard priority queue with buckets but the best one minimizes the costly
memory allocation and needs only 19-45% of memory for typical 3D medical
imaging datasets. Memory saving was reached by an IFT algorithm simplification,
which stores more elements in temporary structures but these elements are
simpler and thus need less memory.
  The best presented modification allows segmentation of large 3D medical
datasets (up to 512x512x680 voxels) with 12-or 16-bits per voxel on currently
available PC based workstations.

hamiltonian formalism for shell(s) (with no symmetry) in Einstein gravity is
developed. An open problem at the end of that paper is to show how the
hamiltonian formalism defines a regular constrained system: the hamiltonian and
the constraints must be differentiable functionals on the phase space, so that
their Poisson Brackets are well defined objects. On the contrary, some
constraints at the shell result to be non differentiable functionals on the
phase space. This problem is tackled, in the present thesis, by following the
reduction procedure suggested by Teitelboim and Henneaux: the singular
constraints are solved and the solution is substituted back into the
hamiltonian. The resulting hamiltonian is shown to lead to equivalent dynamics,
without singular constraints. Besides, the final reduced system (hamiltonian
plus canonical constraints) is shown to be fully differentiable on the reduced
phase space.

symmetric antihermitian Dirac operator is highlighted. This implies that there
is no distinction between the heavy and light quarks and no mass dependent
tuning of the action or operators as long as the discretization error $O(m^2

two light Higgs doublets, and an additional complex scalar weak triplet and
singlet. At the TeV scale, the new particles that cancel the 1-loop quadratic
divergences in the Higgs mass are revealed. The entire Higgs potential needed
for electroweak symmetry breaking--the quartic couplings as well as the
familiar negative mass squared--can be generated by the top Yukawa coupling,
providing a novel link between the physics of flavor and electroweak symmetry
breaking.

The Higgs is one of a set of pseudo Goldstone bosons in an $SU(5)/SO(5)$
nonlinear sigma model. The symmetry breaking scale $f$ is around a TeV, with
the cutoff $\Lambda \lsim 4\pi f \sim $ 10 TeV. A single electroweak doublet,
the ``little Higgs'', is automatically much lighter than the other pseudo
Goldstone bosons. The quartic self-coupling for the little Higgs is generated
by the gauge and Yukawa interactions with a natural size $O(g^2,\lambda_t^2)$,
while the top Yukawa coupling generates a negative mass squared triggering
electroweak symmetry breaking. Beneath the TeV scale the effective theory is
simply the minimal Standard Model. The new particle content at TeV energies
consists of one set of spin one bosons with the same quantum numbers as the
electroweak gauge bosons, an electroweak singlet quark with charge 2/3, and an
electroweak triplet scalar. One loop quadratically divergent corrections to the
Higgs mass are cancelled by interactions with these additional particles.

large D limit and we analyze its 1/D expansion. We find that this expansion is
only consistent for tachyon fields which are polynomials. In that case, we show
that the theory is renormalized by normal ordering the interaction. The
beta-function for the tachyon field is the linear wave operator. We derive an
expression for the tachyon potential and compare with other known expressions.
In particular, our technique gives the exact potential for the quadratic
tachyon profile. It can be used to correct the action which has been derived in
that case iteratively in derivatives of the tachyon field.

sequel math.DG/0011179 on special Lagrangian fibrations and the SYZ Conjecture.
  We briefly present the main results of these four long papers, giving some
explanation and motivation, but no proofs. The aim is to make the results and
ideas accessible to String Theorists and others who have an interest in special
Lagrangian 3-folds and fibrations, but have no desire to read pages of
technical analysis.
  Let N be an SL 3-fold in C^3 invariant under the U(1)-action above. Then
|z_1|^2-|z_2|^2=2a on N for some real number a. Locally, N can be written as a
kind of graph of functions u,v : R^2 --> R satisfying a nonlinear
Cauchy-Riemann equation depending on a, so that u+iv is like a holomorphic
function of x+iy. When a=0 the equations may have singular points where u,v are
not differentiable, which leads to analytic difficulties.
  We prove existence and uniqueness results for solutions u,v on domains S in
R^2 with boundary conditions, including singular solutions. We study their
singularities, giving a rough classification by multiplicity and type. We prove
the existence of large families of fibrations of open subsets of C^3 by
U(1)-invariant SL 3-folds, including singular fibres. Finally, we use these
fibrations as local models to draw conclusions about the SYZ Conjecture on
Mirror Symmetry of Calabi-Yau 3-folds.

$1.4 M_\odot \leq M_{\rm max} \leq 1.7 M_\odot$. The precise value of the
maximum mass turns out to be only weakly correlated with the value of the
energy density at the assumed transition point in nearly symmetric nuclear
matter.

index is demonstrated. It is shown that a photonic structure consisting of two
dielectric materials, with positive and negative dielectric permittivities, can
support electromagnetic surface waves which exhibit the unusual electromagnetic
property of left-handedness (or negative refraction index). Depending on the
dielectric materials, these surface waves localized at the dielectric
interfaces can be either surface plasmons, or phonons. The detailed geometry of
the structure determines whether this composite left-handed material is
isotropic, or anisotropic.

saturated-amplitude tearing modes is investigated. The singularities of the MHD
force balance equation JXB=grad(p) at the modes rational surfaces are resolved
through a proper regularization of the zeroth-order (equilibrium) profiles, by
setting to zero there the gradient of the pressure and parallel current
density. An equilibrium model, which satisfies the regularization rule at the
various rational surfaces, is developed. The comparison with the experimental
data from the Reversed Field eXperiment (RFX) gives encouraging results. The
model provides an easy tool for magnetic analysis: many aspects of the
perturbations can be analyzed and reconstructed.

maximized when the measurement settings are the same for each apparatus. Also
we write down a Bell inequality for the experiment in question which is
violated by quantum mechanics by an amount which is twice as much as the amount

that, while this association is true for distances which are larger than the
penetration lenght, for smaller distances the forerunner is dominated by
under-the-barrier components. We find that its characteristic arrival time is
inversely proportional to the difference between the barrier energy and the
incidence energy, a tunneling time scale different from both the phase time and

for high dimensional multivariate approximation. We study a space of functions
important in many applications. A function space is weighted if certain
variables are more important than others; the weights show the relative
importance of the variables. In an unweighted space all variables are equally
important and multivariate approximation is intractable. We want to study when
the complexity of multivariate approximation is independent of the number of
variables and depends polynomially on 1/E. The main conclusions are:
Multivariate approximation on a quantum computer can be solved roughly
(1/E)^(1+r) times faster than on a classical computer using randomization.
Here, r is a positive parameter that depends on the weights and may be large.
This means that the speed-up of quantum over classical computers may be much
larger than quadratic. Multivariate approximation on a quantum computer is
exponentially faster than on a classical computer with a worst case assurance
even if the sum of weights is infinite but a certain power of them is finite.
We have designed a quantum algorithm with error at most E that uses about
d+log(1/E) qubits. Hence, we have only linear dependence on the dimension d and
logarithmic dependence on 1/E. Therefore, for some applications the number of
qubits is quite modest.
