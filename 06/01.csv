occasionally been detected in the radio, as well in other wavelengths bands. In
particular, the interesting and unusual gamma-ray burst GRB980425, thought to
be related to the radio supernova SN1998bw, is a possible link between the two
classes of objects. Analyzing the extensive radio emission data avaliable for
SN1998bw, one can describe its time evolution within the well established
framework available for the analysis of radio emission from supernovae. This
then allows relatively detailed description of a number of physical properties
of the object. The radio emission can best be explained as the interaction of a
mildly relativistic shock with a dense preexplosion stellar wind-established
circumstellar medium (CSM) that is highly structured both azimuthally, in
clumps or filaments, and radially, with observed density enhancements. Because
of its unusual characteristics for a Type Ib/c supernova, the relation of
SN1998bw to GRB980425 is strengthened and suggests that at least some classes
of GRBs originate in supernova (SN) massive star explosions. Thus, employing
the formalism for describing the radio emission from supernovae (SNe) and
following the link through SN1998bw/GRB980425, it is possible to model the
gross properties of the radio and optical/infrared (OIR) emission from the
half-dozen GRBs with extensive radio observations. From this we conclude that
at least some members of the ``slow-soft'' class of GRBs can be attributed to
the explosion of a massive star in a dense, highly structured CSM that was
presumably established by the preexplosion stellar system.

mass or radius) has been found to have high amplitude in the warp, and there is
no correlation of size/mass with the degree of asymmetry of the warp. b) The
disc density and the ratio of dark to luminous mass show an opposing trend:
smaller values give more asymmetric warps in the inner radii (optical warps)
but show no correlation with the amplitude of the warp; however, in the
external radii neither is there any correlation with the asymmetry. c) A third
anticorrelation arises from a comparison of the amplitude and degree of
asymmetry in the warped galaxies. Hence, it seems that very massive dark matter
haloes have nothing to do with the formation of warps but only with the degree
of symmetry in the inner radii, and are unrelated to the warp shape for the
outermost radii. Denser discs show up the same dependence.

the circumstellar disk masses in a cluster environment at an age of about 2

stellar mass distribution that peaks at 0.2-0.5 Msun. None of the stars are
detected in the millimeter continuum at an intensity level of 3 sigma or
greater. The mean observed flux for the ensemble of 95 stars is 0.22 +/- 0.08
mJy. Assuming a dust temperature of 20 K, a mass opacity coefficient of kappa_o
= 0.02 cm^2/g at 1300 um, and a power law index of beta=1 for the particle
emissivity, these observations imply that the 3 sigma upper limit to the disk
mass around any individual star is 0.025 Msun, and that the average disk mass

Msun in IC 348 is different at the about 3 sigma confidence level from Taurus,

masses. Compared with the minimum mass needed to form the planets in our solar
system (about 0.01 Msun), the lack of massive disks and the low mean disk mass
in IC 348 suggest either that planets more massive than a few Jupiter masses
will form infrequently around 0.2-0.5 Msun stars in IC 348, or that the process
to form such planets has significantly depleted the disk of small dust grains
on time scales less than the cluster age of about 2 Myr.

predicted theoretically as a radiatively cooling flow of hot gas passes through
the coronal temperature regime - independent of its density or metallicity (for
O/H $\gtrsim$ 0.1 solar). Since most of the intregalactic O{\sc vi} clouds obey
this relation, we infer that they can not have metallicities less than a few
percent solar. In order to be able to cool radiatively in less than a Hubble
time, the intergalactic clouds must be smaller than $\sim$1 Mpc in size. We
show that the cooling column densities for the O{\sc iv}, O{\sc v}, Ne{\sc v},
and Ne{\sc vi} ions are comparable to those seen in O{\sc vi}. This is also
true for the Li-like ions Ne{\sc viii}, Mg{\sc x}, and Si{\sc xii} (if the gas

in the extreme-ultraviolet spectral range, and would be accessible to $FUSE$ at

radiatively cooling gas at temperatures an order-of-magnitude higher than where
their ionic fraction peaks. We calculate that the H-like (He-like) O, Ne, Mg,
Si, and S ions have cooling columns of $\sim10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$. The O{\sc vii},

scale magnetic fields. The generation of these fields is somewhat mysterious,
since a magnetic field in a perfectly conducting fluid cannot change the flux
threading a fluid element, or the field topology. Classical dynamo theory
evades this limit by assuming that magnetic reconnection is fast, even for
vanishing resistivity, and that the large scale field can be generated by the
action of kinetic helicity. Both these claims have been severely criticized,
and the latter appears to conflict with strong theoretical arguments based on
magnetic helicity conservation and a series of numerical simulations. Here we
discuss recent efforts to explain fast magnetic reconnection through the
topological effects of a weak stochastic magnetic field component. We also show
how mean-field dynamo theory can be recast in a form which respects magnetic
helicity conservation, and how this changes our understanding of astrophysical
dynamos. Finally, we comment briefly on why an asymmetry between small scale
magnetic and velocity fields is necessary for dynamo action, and how it can
arise naturally.

electrons originating from the superconductor. We first show that it can be
used to detect positive (bosonic--like) noise correlations in an fermionic
system. Furthermore, it provides a source for entangled electrons in the two
arms of the splitter. For generating entangled electron states, we propose two
kinds of setup based either on spin or energy filters. It respectively consists
of ferromagnetic pads and of a system of electrostatic gates which define
quantum dots. The fabrication of this device would require state-of-the-art
nanofabrication techniques, carbon nanotube synthesis and integration, as well
as atomic force microscopy imaging and manipulation.

user-supplied query words. This task has two parts; one is finding ""featured

these words to user-defined search terms. There are two main independent
approaches to achieve this task. The first one, using the concepts of
semantics, has been implemented partially. For more details see another paper
of Marko et al., 2002. The second approach is reported in this paper. It is a
theoretical model based on using Neural Network (NN). Instead of using keywords
or reading from the first few lines from papers/articles, the present model
gives emphasis on extracting ""featured words"" from an article. Obviously we
propose to exclude prepositions, articles and so on, that is, English words
like ""of, the, are, so, therefore, "" etc. from such a list. A neural model is
taken with its nodes pre-assigned energies. Whenever a match is found with
featured words and userdefined search words, the node is fired and jumps to a
higher energy. This firing continues until the model attains a steady energy
level and total energy is now calculated. Clearly, higher match will generate
higher energy; so on the basis of total energy, a ranking is done to the
article indicating degree of relevance to the user's interest. Another
important feature of the proposed model is incorporating a semantic module to
refine the search words; like finding association among search words, etc. In
this manner, information retrieval can be improved markedly.

ways. First, we explore how dissipation in the magneto-viscous boundary layer
(MVBL) at the crust-core interface governs the damping of r-mode perturbations
in the fluid interior. Two models are considered: one assuming an
ordinary-fluid interior, the other taking the core to consist of superfluid
neutrons, type II superconducting protons, and normal electrons. We show,
within our approximations, that no solution to the magnetohydrodynamic
equations exists in the superfluid model when both the neutron and proton
vortices are pinned. However, if just one species of vortex is pinned, we can
find solutions. When the neutron vortices are pinned and the proton vortices
are unpinned there is much more dissipation than in the ordinary-fluid model,
unless the pinning is weak. When the proton vortices are pinned and the neutron
vortices are unpinned the dissipation is comparable or slightly less than that
for the ordinary-fluid model, even when the pinning is strong. We also find in
the superfluid model that relatively weak radial magnetic fields ~ 10^9 G (10^8
K / T)^2 greatly affect the MVBL, though the effects of mutual friction tend to
counteract the magnetic effects. Second, we evolve our two models in time,
accounting for accretion, and explore how the magnetic field strength, the
r-mode saturation amplitude, and the accretion rate affect the cyclic evolution
of these stars. If the r-modes control the spin cycles of accreting neutron
stars we find that magnetic fields can affect the clustering of the spin
frequencies of low mass x-ray binaries (LMXBs) and the fraction of these that
are currently emitting gravitational waves.

representation, on and off the support, for the polynomials orthonormal with
respect to $\sigma$. For the special case that $E$ consists of a finite number
of intervals and that $\sigma$ has no singular component this is a nowaday well
known result of Widom. If $E=[a,b]$ it becomes a classical result due to
Szeg\""o and in case that there appears in addition a singular component, it is
due to Kolmogorov--Krein. In fact the results are presented for the more
general case that the orthogonality measure may have a denumerable set of
mass--points outside of $E$ which are supposed to accumulate on $E$ only and to
satisfy (together with the zeros of the associated Stieltjes function) the
free--interpolation Carleson--type condition. Up to the case of a finite number
of mass points this is even new for the single interval case. Furthermore, as a
byproduct of our representations, we obtain that the recurrence coefficients of
the orthonormal polynomials behave asymptotically almost periodic. Or in other
words the Jacobi matrices associated with the above discussed orthonormal
polynomials are compact perturbations of a one--sided restriction of almost
periodic Jacobi matrices with homogeneous spectrum. Our main tool is a theory
of Hardy spaces of character--automorphic functions and forms on Riemann

media are the ones which accumulate and deliver information using a heuristic
selection of it. This can be made by humans, or by artificial intelligent
systems, exhibiting some form of ""knowledge"". Non-discriminative media just
collect and return information without any distinction. This can also be made
by humans or by artificial systems, but there is no ""knowledge"" involved in the
process. We ranked the words occurring in an edited electronic publication
specialized in complex systems research, and we found that they approximate a
modified Zipf distribution. We compared occurrences of representative words
from the distribution with the occurrences in non-discriminative media. We
found that a non-discriminative medium (Google) has a higher variance from of
our original distribution than a semi-discriminative one (NEC Research Index),
even when both appear to have their own modified Zipf distribution. We conclude
that discriminative media have a higher efficiency rating, at least in the area
in which they specialize, than non-discriminative media. Using the same search
method, the discriminative media should deliver more relevant information. This
relevancy also depends on the skills of the user, but non-discriminative media
are more sensitive to poor searching skills, as there is a higher probability
of delivering irrelevant information. This leads us to suggest the
incorporation of intelligent classifications in different media (such as the
ones suggested by the Semantic Web project), in order to increase the relevance
of the delivered information.
