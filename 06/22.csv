detections of high-energy (TeV) gamma rays in association with low-energy
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Likely values (and/or upper limits) for the source
energies in low- and high-energy gamma rays and hadrons are deduced for the
burst sources associated with possible TeV gamma-ray detections by the Project
GRAND array. Possible spectra for energetic gammas are deduced for three
models: 1) inverse-Compton scattering of ambient photons from relativistic
electrons; 2) proton-synchrotron emission; and 3) inelastic scattering of
relativistic protons from ambient photons creating high-energy neutral pions,
which decay into high-energy photons. These models rely on some basic
assumptions about the GRB properties, e.g. that: the low- and high-energy gamma
rays are produced at the same location; the time variability of the high-energy
component can be estimated from the FWHM of the highest peak in the low-energy
gamma ray light curve; and the variability-luminosity relation of Fenimore &
Ramirez-Ruiz (2000) gives a reliable estimate of the redshifts of these bursts.
We also explore the impact of each of these assumptions upon our models. We
conclude that the energetic requirements are difficult to satisfy for any of
these models unless, perhaps, either the photon beaming angle is much narrower
for the high-energy component than for the low-energy GRB or the bursts occur
at very low redshifts (z<0.01). Nevertheless, we find that the energetic
requirements are most easily satisfied if TeV gamma rays are produced
predominantly by inverse-Compton scattering with a magnetic field strength well
below equipartition or by proton-synchrotron emission with a magnetic field
strength near equipartition.

distinct broad features at 400, 550, and 750 nm that evolve in shape, amplitude

20,000 km/s. The blue feature may be Fe II. We interpret the polarization
evolution in terms of the impact of a bipolar flow from the core that is
stopped within the outer envelope of a carbon/oxygen core. Although the
symmetry axis remains fixed, as the photosphere retreats by different amounts
in different directions due to the asymmetric velocity flow and density
distribution, geometrical blocking effects in deeper, Ca-rich layers can lead
to a different dominant axis in the Q-U plane. We conclude that the features
that characterize SN 2002ap, specifically its high velocity, can be accounted
for in an asymmetric model with a larger ejecta mass than SN 1994I such that
the photosphere remains longer in higher velocity material. The characteristics
of ""hypernovae"" may be the result of orientation effects in a mildly
inhomogeneous set of progenitors, rather than requiring an excessive total

restricts the stellar energy source to proton-proton burning rather than the

harder spectra than their present-day counterparts of finite metallicity. We
present new results from a continuing study of metal-free stars from a
cosmological point of view. We have calculated evolving spectra of Pop III
clusters, derived from a grid of zero-metallicity stellar evolutionary tracks.
We find that H-ionizing photon production from metal-free stellar clusters
takes twice as long as that of Pop II to decline to 1/10 its peak value. In
addition, metal-free stars produce substantially more photons than Pop II in
the HeII ($E > 4$ Ryd) continuum. We suggest that large Ly$\alpha$ equivalent
widths ($W_{\rm Ly\alpha} > 400$ Angstroms) may provide a means of detecting
metal-free stellar populations at high redshift, and that HeII recombination
lines ($\lambda$1640, $\lambda$4686) may confirm identifications of Population
III. While Pop III clusters are intrinsically bluer than their Pop II
counterparts, nebular continuum emission makes up this difference and may
confuse attempts to discern Pop III stars with broadband colors. In a companion
paper, we explore the consequences of evolving spectra of Pop III for the

Pop III stars alone can reionize HI and HeII at redshifts, $z$ of about 9 (4.7)
and 5.1 (0.7) for continuous (instantaneous) modes of star formation. More
realistic scenarios involving combinations of Pop III and Pop II stellar

in these cases; the ionization fraction of HeIII reaches a maximum of about 60
percent at $z$ of about 5.6 if Pop III star formation lasts for $10^9$ yr.

available to the formation of the first objects, and provide a constraint on
values of $\sigma_8$ less than or about 0.7. Since current UV observations
indicate an epoch of reionization for HeII at $z$ of about 3, HeII may reionize
more than once. Measurements of the HeII Gunn-Peterson effect in the

of Pop III stars for HeII reionization, particularly in void regions that may
contain relic ionization from early Pop III stellar activity.

formation in these clouds, feedback from supernovae in the form of thermal
heating and cloud evaporation, galactic winds and outflows, and metal
enrichment. Implemented using SPH, our scheme is a significantly modified and
extended version of the grid-based method of Yepes et al. (1997), and enables
us to achieve high dynamic range in simulations of structure formation. We
discuss properties of the feedback model in detail and show that it predicts a
self-regulated, quiescent mode of star formation, which, in particular,
stabilises the star forming gaseous layers of disk galaxies. The
parameterisation of this mode can be reduced to a single free quantity which
determines the overall timescale for star formation. We fix this parameter to
match the observed rates of star formation in local disk galaxies. When
normalised in this manner, cosmological simulations nevertheless overproduce
the observed cosmic abundance of stellar material. We are thus motivated to
extend our feedback model to include galactic winds associated with star
formation. Using small-scale simulations of individual star-forming disk
galaxies, we show that these winds produce either galactic fountains or
outflows, depending on the depth of the gravitational potential. Moreover,
outflows from galaxies in these simulations drive chemical enrichment of the
intergalactic medium, in principle accounting for the presence of metals in the
Lyman alpha forest. (abridged)

formation is broadly consistent with measurements, given observational
uncertainty. From the present epoch, it gradually rises by about a factor of
ten to a peak at z~5-6, which is beyond the redshift range where it has been

carry out extensive molecular dynamics calculations on dense systems
interacting via a square-well potential. This is one of the simplest systems
with the required properties, and may be regarded as canonical for interpreting
the phase diagram, and now also the dynamical arrest. We confirm the
theoretical predictions for re-entrance, logarithmic singularity, and give the

coexisting glasses. We now regard the previous predictions of these phenomena

excitations). At nu slightly larger (smaller) than unity, reversed spin
electrons (spin holes) can form bound states with K spin waves that are known
as skyrmions, S_K^- (antiskyrmions, S_K^+). It is suggested in this work that a
valence hole can also bind K spin waves to form an excitonic complex X_K^+,
analogous to the S_K^+. One spin hole of the S_K^+ is simply replaced by the
valence hole. At nu<=1, a small number of S_K^+'s are present before
introduction of the valence hole. The (S_K^+)-(X_K^+) repulsion leads to
correlations and photoluminescence similar to those of a dilute

wrapped once around a genus-zero holomorphic curve is proportional to the
Pfaffian involving the determinant of a Dirac operator on this curve. We show
that the space of zero modes of this Dirac operator is the kernel of a linear
mapping that is dependent on the associated vector bundle moduli. By explicitly
computing the determinant of this map, one can deduce whether or not the
dimension of the space of zero modes vanishes. It is shown that this
information is sufficient to completely determine the Pfaffian and, hence, the
non-perturbative superpotential as explicit holomorphic functions of the vector
bundle moduli. This method is illustrated by a number of non-trivial examples.

paths generated by quasi-autonomous Hamiltonians on symplectically aspherical

role of the fixed global extrema in the Floer complex of the generating
Hamiltonian. Our main result determines a natural condition on a fixed global
maximum of a Hamiltonian which implies that the corresponding path minimizes
the positive Hofer length. We use this to prove that a quasi-autonomous
Hamiltonian generates a length minimizing path if it has under-twisted fixed
global extrema and no periodic orbits with period one and action greater than
the fixed extrema. This, in turn, allows us to produce new examples of
autonomous Hamiltonian flows which are length minimizing for all times. These
constructions are based on the geometry of coisotropic submanifolds. Finally,
we give a new proof of the recent theorem of D. McDuff which states that
quasi-autonomous Hamiltonians generate length minimizing paths over short time
intervals.
