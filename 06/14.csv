fundamental distance scale calibrator, delta Cep. We obtain these with
astrometric data from FGS 3, a white-light interferometer on HST. Utilizing
spectrophotometric estimates of the absolute parallaxes of our astrometric
reference stars and constraining delta Cep and reference star HD 213307 to
belong to the same association (Cep OB6, de Zeeuw et al. 1999), we find
pi_{abs} = 3.66 +/- 0.15 mas. The larger than typical astrometric residuals for
the nearby astrometric reference star HD 213307 are found to satisfy Keplerian
motion with P = 1.07 +/- 0.02 years, a perturbation and period that could be
due to a F0V companion ~7 mas distant from and ~4 magnitudes fainter than the
primary. Spectral classifications and VRIJHKT$_2$M and DDO51 photometry of the
astrometric reference frame surrounding delta Cep indicate that field
extinction is high and variable along this line of sight. However the
extinction suffered by the reference star nearest (in angular separation and
distance) to delta Cep, HD 213307, is lower and nearly the same as for delta
Cep. Correcting for color differences, we find <A_V> = 0.23 +/- 0.03 for delta
Cep, hence, an absolute magnitude M_V = -3.47 +/- 0.10. Adopting an average V
magnitude, <V> = 15.03 +/- 0.03, for Cepheids with log P = 0.73 in the LMC from
Udalski et al. (1999), we find a V-band distance modulus for the LMC, m-M =
18.50 +/- 0.13 or, 18.58 +/- 0.15, where the latter value results from a highly
uncertain metallicity correction (Freedman et al. 2001). These agree with our
previous RR Lyr HST parallax-based determination of the distance modulus of the
LMC.

develop empirical parameterized models of the jet geometry and the
three-dimensional distributions of the velocity, emissivity and magnetic-field
structure and optimize their parameters by fitting the predicted synchrotron
intensity and polarization to deep 8.4-GHz VLA observations. We conclude that
the jets are at roughly 52 degrees to the line of sight, that they decelerate
and that they have transverse velocity gradients. They have three regions with
distinct kinematics: a narrow inner region; a flaring region of rapid expansion
followed by recollimation and a conical outer region. There is a discontinuity
in the flow between inner and flaring regions. The on-axis velocity is close to
0.8c until the end of the flaring region, where it drops abruptly to 0.55c,
thereafter falling more slowly to 0.25c at the end of the modelled region.
Throughout the flaring and outer regions, the velocity at the edge of the jet
is 0.7 of its on-axis value. The magnetic field has primarily toroidal and
longitudinal components except in the flaring region, where there is a
significant radial component at the jet edge. Simple adiabatic models fail in
the inner and flaring regions. The inferred transverse velocity profiles and
field structure in the flaring region support the idea that the jets decelerate
by entraining the external medium. We demonstrate the appearance of our model
at other angles to the line of sight and argue that other low-luminosity radio
galaxies resemble 3C 31 seen at different orientations. [Abridged]

This is significantly higher than the fraction of bright LMXBs in Galactic GCs
and confirms that GCs are the dominant sites of LMXB formation in early type
galaxies. The approximately 4% of NGC 4472 GCs hosting bright LMXBs, on the
other hand, is remarkably similar to the fraction of GCs with LMXBs in every
other galaxy. Although statistical tests suggest that the luminosity of a
cluster is an important driver of LMXB formation in GCs, this appears largely
to be a consequence of the greater number of stars in bright clusters. The
metallicity of GCs is a strong determinant of LMXB specific frequency, with
metal-rich clusters about 3 times more likely to host LMXBs than metal-poor
ones. There are weaker dependences on the size of a GC and its distance from
the center of the galaxy. The X-ray luminosity does not depend significantly on
the properties of the host GC. Furthermore, the spatial distribution and X-ray
luminosity function of LMXBs within and outside GCs are indistinguishable. The
X-ray luminosity function of both GC-LMXBs and non-GC-LMXBs reveal a break at

transit light curve with two or more transits if the planet has a circular
orbit and the light curve is observed in a band pass where limb darkening is
negligible. The existence of this unique solution is very useful for current
planet transit surveys for several reasons. First, there is an analytic
solution that allows a quick parameter estimate, in particular of Rp. Second,
the stellar density can be uniquely derived from the transit light curve alone.
The stellar density can be used to immediately rule out a giant star (and hence
a much larger than planetary companion) and can also be used to put an upper
limit on the stellar and planet radius even considering slightly evolved stars.
Third, the presence of an additional fully blended star that contaminates an
eclipsing system to mimic a planet transit can be largely ruled out from the
transit light curve given a spectral type for the central star. Fourth, the
period can be estimated from a single-transit light curve and a measured
spectral type. All of these applications can be used to select the best planet
transit candidates for mass determination by radial velocity follow-up. To use
these applications in practice, the photometric precision and time sampling of
the light curve must be high (better than 0.005 mag precision and 5 minute time
sampling).

efficiency of PSR B0950+08, estimated from its spin-down power and the detected
optical flux, is by several orders of magnitude higher than for these pulsars,
and comparable with that for the much younger and more energetic Crab pulsar.
We cannot exclude the presence of a compact, about 1'', faint pulsar nebula

Wolf-Rayet stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Stellar parameters are revised
significantly relative to Grafener et al. (1998) based on improved observations
and more sophisticated model atmosphere codes, which account for line
blanketing and clumping. We find that stellar luminosities are revised upwards
by up to 0.4 dex, with surface abundances spanning a lower range of
0.1<C/He<0.35 (20-45% carbon by mass) and O/He<0.06 (<10% oxygen by mass).
Relative to Galactic WC5-8 stars at known distance, and analysed in a similar
manner, LMC WC4 stars possess systematically higher stellar luminosities,
0.2dex lower wind densities, yet a similar range of surface chemistries. We
illustrate how the classification CIII 5696 line is extremely sensitive to wind
density, such that this is the principal difference between the subtype
distribution of LMC and Galactic early-type WC stars. Temperature differences
do play a role, but carbon abundance does not affect WC spectral types. We
illustrate the effect of varying temperature and mass-loss rate on the WC
spectral type for HD32257 (WC4, LMC) and HD156385 (WC7, Galaxy) which possess
similar abundances and luminosities.
  Using the latest evolutionary models, pre-supernova stellar masses in the
range 11-19 Mo are anticipated for LMC WC4 stars, with 7-14 Mo for Galactic WC
stars with known distances. These values are consistent with pre-cursors of
bright Type-Ic supernovae such as SN1998bw (alias GRB 980425) for which a

generated not at the photosphere but in the corona, aiming at heating in the
mid- to low-latitude corona where the low-speed wind is expected to come from.
Acoustic waves of period tau ~ 100s are triggered by chromospheric
reconnection, one model of small scale magnetic reconnection events recently
proposed by Sturrock. These waves having a finite amplitude eventually form
shocks to shape sawtooth waves (N-waves), and directly heat the surrounding
corona by dissipation of their wave energy. Outward propagation of the N-waves
is treated based on the weak shock theory, so that the heating rate can be
evaluated consistently with physical properties of the background coronal
plasma without setting a dissipation length in an ad hoc manner. We construct
coronal structures from the upper chromosphere to the outside of 1AU for
various inputs of the acoustic waves having a range of energy flux of F_{w,0} =
(1-20) times 10^5 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a period of tau = 60-300s. The heating
by the N-wave dissipation effectively works in the inner corona and we find
that the waves of F_{w,0} >= 2 times 10^5 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} and tau >= 60s
could maintain peak coronal temperature, T_{max} > 10^6 K. The model could also
reproduce the density profile observed in the streamer region. However, due to
its short dissipation length, the location of T_{max} is closer to the surface
than the observation, and the resultant flow velocity of the solar wind is
lower than the observed profile of the low-speed wind. The cooperations with
other heating and acceleration sources with the larger dissipation length are
inevitable to reproduce the real solar corona.

images using models derived from the stellar distributions in nearby early-type
galaxies. We find that realistic galaxies predict a remarkably wide range of
core images, with lensing magnifications spanning some six orders of magnitude.
More concentrated galaxies produce fainter core images, although not with any
simple, quantitative, model independent relation. Some real galaxies have
diffuse cores and predict bright core images (magnification mu>~0.1), but more
common are galaxies that predict faint core images (mu<~0.001). Thus, stellar
mass distributions alone are probably concentrated enough to explain the lack
of observed core images, and may require observational sensitivity to improve
by an order of magnitude before detections of core images become common.
Two-image lenses will tend to have brighter core images than four-image lenses,
so they will be the better targets for finding core images and exploiting these
tools for studying the central mass distributions of distant galaxies.

Manipulating nonequilibrium spin coherence in device applications thus requires
understanding how valence and conduction band spin splitting affects carrier
spin dynamics. This paper studies the relevance of this decoherence mechanism
for collective intersubband spin-density excitations (SDEs) in quantum wells. A
density-functional formalism for the linear spin-density matrix response is
presented that describes SDEs in the conduction band of quantum wells with
subbands that may be non-parabolic and spin-split due to bulk or structural
inversion asymmetry (Rashba effect). As an example, we consider a 40 nm
GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well, including Rashba spin splitting of the conduction
subbands. We find a coupling and wavevector-dependent splitting of the
longitudinal and transverse SDEs. However, decoherence of the SDEs is not
determined by subband spin splitting, due to collective effects arising from
dynamical exchange and correlation.

becomes anomalous (non-Fickian) with the growth of the clay content. This
transition is attributed to immobilization of penetrant molecules on the
surfaces of hydrophilic clay layers. Observations in uniaxial tensile tests
demonstrate that the response of vinyl ester resin is strongly elastoplastic,
whereas an increase in the clay content results in a severe decrease of plastic
strains observed as a noticeable reduction of curvatures of the stress--strain
diagrams. This is explained by slowing down of molecular mobility in the host
matrix driven by confinement of chains in galleries between platelets.
Constitutive equations are developed for the anomalous moisture diffusion
through and the elastoplastic behavior of a nanocomposite. Adjustable
parameters in these relations are found by fitting the experimental data. Fair
agreement is demonstrated between the observations and the results of numerical
simulation. A striking similarity is revealed between changes in diffusivity,
ultimate water uptake and the rate of plastic flow with an increase in the clay
content.

(m_{PS}/m_V \approx 0.75 - 0.4), assuming the u and d quarks being degenerate

chiral singularities is supported from an analysis of the pseudoscalar meson
data. We take m_\pi, m_\rho and m_K (or m_\phi) as input. After chiral and
continuum extrapolations, the agreement of the calculated mass spectrum with
experiment is at a 10% level. In comparison with the statistical accuracy of
1-3% and systematic errors of at most 1.7% we have achieved, this demonstrates
a failure of the quenched approximation for the hadron spectrum: the meson
hyperfine splitting is too small, and the octet masses and the decuplet mass
splittings are both smaller than experiment. Light quark masses are calculated
using two definitions: the conventional one and the one based on the
axial-vector Ward identity. The two results converge toward the continuum
limit, yielding m_{ud}=4.29(14)^{+0.51}_{-0.79} MeV. The s quark mass depends
on the strange hadron mass chosen for input: m_s = 113.8(2.3)^{+5.8}_{-2.9} MeV
from m_K and m_s = 142.3(5.8)^{+22.0}_{-0} MeV from m_\phi, indicating again a

conserved, a similar disappearance is impossible for a proton. The existing
experimental lifetime limit for neutron disappearance is 4-7 orders of
magnitude lower than the lifetime limits with detectable nucleon decay products

nuclear de-excitations that would result from the disappearance of a neutron or
two neutrons from $^{12}$C. We found that some de-excitation modes have
signatures that are advantageous for detection in the modern high-mass,
low-background, and low-threshold underground detectors, where neutron
disappearance would result in a characteristic sequence of time- and
space-correlated events. Thus, in the KamLAND detector [Kamland], a
time-correlated triple coincidence of a prompt signal, a captured neutron, and
a $\beta^{+}$ decay of the residual nucleus, all originating from the same

can be traced back to certain {\em a priori} assumptions about the nature of
space and time: assumptions that may be incompatible with the view of space and
time adopted by a quantum gravity theory. My conjecture is that in, some yet to
be determined sense, to each type of space-time there is associated a
corresponding type of quantum theory in which continuum quantities do not
necessarily appear, being replaced with structures that are appropriate to the
specific space-time.
  Topos theory then arises as a possible tool for `gluing' together these
different theories associated with the different space-times. As a concrete
example of the use of topos ideas, I summarise recent work applying presheaf
theory to the Kochen-Specher theorem and the assignment of values to physical

set of linearly independent pure quantum states. We show that the design of the
optimal measurement that minimizes the probability of an inconclusive result
can be formulated as a semidefinite programming problem. Based on this
formulation, we develop a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for an
optimal quantum measurement. We show that the optimal measurement can be
computed very efficiently in polynomial time by exploiting the many well-known
algorithms for solving semidefinite programs, which are guaranteed to converge
to the global optimum.
  Using the general conditions for optimality, we derive necessary and
sufficient conditions so that the measurement that results in an equal
probability of an inconclusive result for each one of the quantum states is
optimal. We refer to this measurement as the equal-probability measurement
(EPM). We then show that for any state set, the prior probabilities of the
states can be chosen such that the EPM is optimal.
  Finally, we consider state sets with strong symmetry properties and equal
prior probabilities for which the EPM is optimal. We first consider
geometrically uniform state sets that are defined over a group of unitary
matrices and are generated by a single generating vector. We then consider
compound geometrically uniform state sets which are generated by a group of
unitary matrices using multiple generating vectors, where the generating
vectors satisfy a certain (weighted) norm constraint.
