  Accepted for publication in ApJL","Astrophys.J. 574 (2002) L47-L50","10.1086/342367",,"astro-ph",,"  It is well known that high-energy emission (MeV-GeV) has been observed in a
number of gamma-ray bursts, and temporally-extended emission from lower energy
gamma rays through radio wavelengths is well established. An important observed
characteristic of some bursts at low energy is quiescence: an initial emission
followed by a quiet period before a second (postquiescent) emission. Evidence
for significant high-energy, postquiescent emission has been lacking. Here we
present evidence for high-energy emission, coincident with lower energy
emission, from the postquiescent emission episode of the very bright and long
burst, GRB 990104. We show light curves and spectra that confirm emission above
50 MeV, approximately 152 seconds after the BATSE trigger and initial emission
episode. Between the initial emission episode and the main peak, seen at both
low and high energy, there was a quiescent period of ~100 s during which the
burst was relatively quiet. This burst was found as part of an ongoing search
for high-energy emission in gamma-ray bursts using the EGRET fixed interval (32
s) accumulation spectra, which provide sensitivity to later, high-energy
emission that is otherwise missed by the standard EGRET BATSE-triggered burst
spectra.

to demonstrate that brown dwarfs are a natural and frequent product of the
collapse and fragmentation of a turbulent molecular cloud. The brown dwarfs
form via the fragmentation of dense molecular gas in unstable multiple systems
and are ejected from the dense gas before they have been able to accrete to
stellar masses. Thus, they can be viewed as `failed stars'. Approximately three
quarters of the brown dwarfs form in gravitationally-unstable circumstellar
discs while the remainder form in collapsing filaments of molecular gas. These
formation mechanisms are very efficient, producing roughly the same number of
brown dwarfs as stars, in agreement with recent observations. However, because
close dynamical interactions are involved in their formation, we find a very
low frequency of binary brown dwarf systems ($\lsim 5$%) and that those binary
brown dwarf systems that do exist must be close $\lsim 10$ AU. Similarly, we
find that young brown dwarfs with large circumstellar discs (radii $\gsim 10$
AU) are rare ($\approx 5$%).

have used the F and early G stars to spectroscopically estimate
[Fe/H]=-0.096+/-0.081 for NGC 6633 and with more precision that NGC 6633 has
(0.074+/-0.041) dex less iron than the Pleiades and (0.206+/-0.040) dex less

members and compared with consistently determined Li abundances in other
clusters. Several mid F stars in NGC 6633 show strong Li depletion at
approximately the same effective temperature that this phenomenon is seen in
the Hyades. At cooler temperatures the Li abundance patterns in several open
clusters with similar ages (NGC 6633, Hyades, Praesepe and Coma Berenices) are
remarkably similar, despite their differing [Fe/H]. There is however evidence
that the late G and K stars of NGC 6633 have depleted less Li than their Hyades
counterparts. This qualitatively agrees with models for pre-main sequence Li
depletion that feature only convective mixing, but these models cannot
simultaneously explain why these stars have in turn depleted Li by more than 1
dex compared with their ZAMS counterparts in the Pleiades. Two explanations are
put forward. The first is that elemental abundance ratios, particularly [O/Fe],
may have non-solar values in NGC 6633 and would have to be higher than in
either the Hyades or Pleiades. The second is that additional non-convective
mixing, driven by angular momentum loss, causes additional photospheric Li
depletion during the first few hundred Myr of main sequence evolution.

Prominent line polarization is also seen, especially in the trough of the Ca II

a fair degree of axisymmetry, although the polarization angle of the dominant
polarization axes are different by about 55 deg. between the two epochs,

exists some spectropolarimetric evidence for a different distribution of Ca

very weak continuum and broad emission lines, indicating that SN 2002ap has

those of ``normal'' SNe Ic in the nebular phase, and the emission lines are not

observation of the archetypal merger radio galaxy NGC 1316 (Fornax A). We
confirm the presence of fine sub-structures in the hot Interstellar Medium
(ISM). Some of these are likely to result from interaction with the radio jets,
while others may be related to a complex intermingling of different phases of
the ISM. We detect a low-luminosity X-ray AGN with Lx = 5 x 1039 erg sec-1 (in
0.3-8 keV) and a G=1.7 power-law energy spectrum. We also detect 81 point
sources within the 25th magnitude isophotal ellipse of NGC 1316 (Lx in the
range of 2 x 1037 - 2 x 1039 erg sec-1), with hard (kT~5 keV) X-ray spectra,
typical of X-ray binaries, and a spatial radial distribution consistent with
that of the optical (i.e., stellar) surface brightness. We derive the X-ray
luminosity function (XLF) of these sources, correcting for the incompleteness
at the faint end caused by the presence of the diffuse emission from the hot
ISM in the central regions of NGC 1316 and by the widening of the Chandra PSFs
at increasing distance from the aim point. With these corrections, the XLF is
well reproduced by a single -unbroken- power law with a slope of -1.3 down to
our threshold luminosity of ~3 x 1037 erg sec-1. The hot ISM has temperatures
in the 0.5 - 0.6 keV range, its surface brightness distribution is more
centrally concentrated than that of the point sources, and its temperature
appears to decrease at larger radii. These properties suggest that the ISM may
be subject to partial winds. Taking into account the spectral complexity of the
ISM, and the presence of unresolved low luminosity X-ray sources (which can be
inferred from the spectra), we constrain the metal abundance of the hot ISM to

detected in optical surveys) which could account for a part of the
field-to-field variation seen in the X-ray number counts. The flux
contributions separated into unit bins of redshift show that the z<1
spectroscopically identified sources already contribute about one-third of the
total flux in both the hard and soft bands. We find from ratios of the X-ray
counts that the X-ray spectra are well-described by absorption of an intrinsic
Gamma=1.8 power-law, with log NH values ranging from 21 to 23.7. We estimate
that the Chandra sources that produce 87% of the HEAO-A X-ray background (XRB)
at 3 keV produce 57% at 20 keV, provided that at high energies the spectral
shape of the sources continues to be well-described by a Gamma=1.8 power-law.
However, when the Chandra contributions are renormalized to the BeppoSAX XRB at
3 keV, the shape matches fairly well the observed XRB at both energies. Thus,
whether a substantial population of as-yet undetected Compton-thick sources is
required to completely resolve the XRB above 10 keV depends critically on how
the currently discrepant XRB measurements in the 1-10 keV energy range tie
together with the higher energy XRB. (Abridged)

flow clusters is poorly understood. Here we address this issue using data from
our near-infrared spectroscopic survey of 32 of the most line luminous such
systems, presented in the companion paper by Edge et al. (2002).
  We consider excitation by X-rays from the surrounding intracluster medium, UV
radiation from young stars, and shocks. The v=1-0 K-band lines with upper
levels within 10^4 K of the ground state appear to be mostly thermalised
(implying gas densities above ~10^5 cm^-3), with excitation temperatures
typically exceeding 2000K, as found earlier by Jaffe, Bremer and van der Werf
(2001). Together with the lack of strong v=2-0 lines in the H-band, this rules
out UV fluorescence.
  Using the CLOUDY photoionisation code, we deduce that the H_2 lines can
originate in a population of dense clouds, exposed to the same hot (T~50000K)
stellar continuum as the lower density gas which produces the bulk of the
forbidden optical line emission in the H-alpha luminous systems. This dense gas
may be in the form of self-gravitating clouds deposited directly by the cooling
flow, or may instead be produced in the high-pressure zones behind strong
shocks. Furthermore, the shocked gas is likely to be gravitationally unstable,
so collisions between the larger clouds may lead to the formation of globular
clusters.

show strongly enhanced gate coupling, most likely due to reduction of defect

data in the ``on''-state indicates that these CNFETs are nearly ballistic

detail and an expression for the mean first-passage time (MFPT) from non-native

negative-energy pulse must necessarily be followed by an over-compensating
positive-energy one within a certain maximum time delay. Furthermore, the
minimum amount of over-compensation increases with the separation between the
pulses. In this paper, we first study the case of a negative-energy square
pulse followed by a positive-energy one for a minimally coupled, massless
scalar field in two-dimensional Minkowski space. We obtain explicit expressions
for the maximum time delay and the amount of over-compensation needed, using a
previously developed eigenvalue approach. These results are then used to give a
proof of the quantum interest conjecture for massless scalar fields in two
dimensions, valid for general energy distributions.

evidence is gathered that the gluon condensate, often being the leading

the geometry. We argue that for this reason the three dimensional parabolic
orbifold is not amenable to perturbation theory. Similarly, the smooth four

also appears problematic. However, when the number of noncompact dimensions is

singularities. We show that any resolution X of an isolated cyclic quotient
singularity admits a complete scalar-flat Kaehler metric (which is hyperkaehler
if and only if c_1(X)=0), and that if c_1(X)<0 then X also admits a complete
(non-Kaehler) self-dual Einstein metric of negative scalar curvature. In
particular, complete self-dual Einstein metrics are constructed on
simply-connected non-compact 4-manifolds with arbitrary second Betti number.
  Deformations of these self-dual Einstein metrics are also constructed: they
come in families parameterized, roughly speaking, by free functions of one real
variable.
  All the metrics constructed here are toric (that is, the isometry group
contains a 2-torus) and are essentially explicit. The key to the construction
is the remarkable fact that toric self-dual Einstein metrics are given quite
generally in terms of linear partial differential equations on the hyperbolic

questions regarding the quantities (Holevo) capacity of a quantum channel T and
entanglement of formation of a given bipartite state.
  In particular, using the Stinespring dilation theorem, we give a formula for
the channel capacity involving entanglement of formation. This can be used to
show that additivity of the latter for some states can be inferred from the
additivity of capacity for certain channels.
  We demonstrate this connection for a family of group--covariant channels,
allowing us to calculate the entanglement cost for many states, including some
where a strictly smaller upper bound on the distillable entanglement is known.
Group symmetry is used for more sophisticated analysis, giving formulas valid
for a class of channels. This is presented in a general framework, extending
recent findings of Vidal, Dur and Cirac (e-print quant-ph/0112131).
  We speculate on a general relation of superadditivity of the entanglement of
formation, which would imply both the general additivity of this function under
tensor products and of the Holevo capacity (with or without linear cost

demonstrated for qubit discrimination in 1550 nm. Spikes accompanied with the
signals in gated-mode were canceled by balanced output from the two APDs. The
spike cancellation enabled one to reduce the threshold in the discriminators,
and thus the gate pulse voltage. The dark count probability and afterpulse
probability were reduced to 7x10^-7 and 10^-4, respectively, without affecting
the detection efficiency (11 %) at 178 K.

Opt","J. Mod. Opt. 50, 1 (2003)","10.1080/09500340308234530",,"quant-ph",,"  The spectacular experimental results of the last few years in cavity quantum
electrodynamics and trapped ions research has led to very high level laboratory
performances. Such a stimulating situation essentially stems from two decisive
advancements. The first is the invention of reliable protocols for the
manipulation of single atoms. The second is the ability to produce desired
bosonic environments on demand. These progresses have led to the possibility of
controlling the form of the coupling between individual atoms and an arbitrary
number of bosonic modes. As a consequence, fundamental matter-radiation
interaction models like, for instance, the JC model and most of its numerous
nonlinear multiphoton generalizations, have been realized or simulated in
laboratory and their dynamical features have been tested more or less in
detail. This topical paper reviews the state of the art of the theoretical
investigations and of the experimental observations concerning the dynamical
features of the coupling between single few-level atoms and two bosonic modes.
In the course of the paper we show that such a configuration provides an
excellent platform for investigating various quantum intermode correlation
effects tested or testable in the cavity quantum electrodynamics and trapped
ion experimental realms. In particular we discuss a mode-mode correlation
effect appearing in the dynamics of a two-level atom quadratically coupled to
two bosonic modes. This effect, named parity effect, consists in a high
sensitivity to the evenness or oddness of the total number of bosonic
excitations.

These equations describe a system with mass spectra of the form $m^2=a^2+b^2

a reduction of the motion equation for two particles to a one-particle equation
which describes the particle in various mass and spin states. It we impose a
certain condition on the wave function of the derived equation, such an
equation describes the free motion of a fixed-mass particle with arbitrary (but
