the jet from DG Tau within 0.""5 from the source (or 110 AU along this flow). We
analysed line profiles extracted from a set of seven spectra taken with STIS on
board the Hubble Space Telescope, with the slits parallel to the jet axis but
displaced transversely every 0"".07. For the flow of moderate velocity (-70
km/s), we have found systematic differences in the radial velocities of lines
emitted on alternate sides of the jet axis. The results are corrected for the
effects due to uneven illumination of the slit. The relative Doppler shifts
range from 5 to 20 km/s. If this is interpreted as rotation, the flow is then
rotating clockwise looking from the jet towards the source and the derived
toroidal velocities are in the range 6 - 15 km/s. Using recent estimates of the
mass loss rate, one obtains for the considered velocity regime, an angular
momentum flux of ~ 3.8x10E-5 M_sun/yr AU km/s. Our findings may constitute the
first detection of rotation in the initial channel of a jet flow. The derived
values appear to be consistent with the predictions of popular

significant fraction of mass in the dark matter haloes that surround L L*
galaxies is bound in substructures of mass 1E4-1E7Msun. The number of
observable baryonic substructures (such as dwarf galaxies and globular
clusters) falls short of these predictions by at least an order of magnitude.
We present a method for searching for substructure in the haloes of
gravitational lenses that produce multiple images of QSOs, such as 4-image
Einstein Cross lenses. Current methods based on broadband flux ratios cannot
cleanly distinguish between substructure, differential extinction, microlensing
and, most importantly, ambiguities in the host lens model. These difficulties
may be overcome by utilizing the prediction that when substructure is present,
the magnification will be a function of source size. QSO broad line and narrow
line emission regions are approximately ~1pc and >100pc in size, respectively.
When narrow line region (NLR) features are used as a normalisation, the
relative intensity and equivalent width of broad line region (BLR) features
will respectively reflect substructure-lensing and microlensing effects.
Spectroscopic observations of just a few image pairs would probably be able to
cleanly extract the desired substructure signature and distinguish it from
microlensing. In the rest-optical, the Hbeta/[OIII] region is ideal, since the
narrow wavelength range also largely eliminates differential reddening
problems. Simulations of Q2237+030 are done as an example to determine the
level of substructure that is detectable in this way, and possible systematic
difficulties are discussed. This is an ideal experiment to be carried out with
near-infrared integral field unit spectrographs on 8-m class telescopes.

independent of any obvious galaxy parameter. We then use the data to
recalibrate the zero point of the PNLF distance scale. We use a sample of 28

offset: Cepheid-calibrated PNLF distances are, on average, ~0.3 mag smaller
than Cepheid-calibrated SBF distances. We discuss the possible causes of this
offset, and suggest that internal extinction in the bulges of the SBF
calibration galaxies is the principle cause of the discrepancy. If this is
correct, the SBF-based Hubble Constant must be increased by ~7%. We use our
distance to NGC 4258 to argue that the short distance scale to the LMC is

quite weak. The covariance matrix of the shear correlation function is then
used to investigate the expected accuracy of cosmological parameter estimates
from cosmic shear surveys. Depending on the use of prior information, e.g. from

to synchrotron self-absorption or free-free absorption. While it is difficult
to discriminate between these two processes based on a goodness-of-fit, the
unabsorbed emission in the free-free model requires an unreasonably large
ejecta energy. Therefore, on physical grounds we favor the synchrotron
self-absorption (SSA) model. In the SSA framework, at about day 2, the shock
speed is approximately 0.3c, the energy in relativistic electrons and magnetic
fields is approximately 1.5e45 erg and the inferred progenitor mass loss rate
is approximately 5e-7 solar masses per year (assuming a 1,000 km/sec wind).
These properties are consistent with a model in which the outer, high velocity
supernova ejecta interact with the progenitor wind. The amount of relativistic
ejecta in this model is small, so that the presence of broad lines in the
spectrum of a Type Ib/c supernova, as observed in SN 2002ap, is not a reliable
indicator of a connection to relativistic ejecta and hence gamma-ray emission.

relative position shift for the source and a single vertical atmospheric delay
error in the correlator model for each antenna. The rms of the relative
positions for the three observations is only 0.01 mas, which is approximately
the expected position error due to thermal noise. Also, we present a method to

energy spectrum of the vibrations of the mosaic depends on the glass transition
temperature, the Debye frequency and the molecular length scale. The resulting

is typical to 1D system. In the large $a$ regime, the mean cluster size $k$
increases as $a^{1/2}$. Furthermore, the asymptotic approach towards the

or a factorization system, are a consequence of the cowellpoweredness of X. In
the absence of cowellpoweredness, for general results, fairly strong assumption
on the category are needed. This paper provides a number of novel and useful
observations to tackle the cowellpoweredness problem of subcategories by means
of regular closure operators. Our exposition focusses on the question when two
subcategories A and B induce the same regular closure operators, then
information about (non)-cowellpoweredness of A may be gained from corresponding
property of B, and vice versa.

from a single cell is studied. Cell differentiation process is found to occur
through instability in transient dynamics and cell-cell interaction. In a long

itinerancy over successive quasi-stable multi-cellular states consisting of
different types of cells. By defining the plasticity of a cellular state, it is
shown that the plasticity of cells decreases before the large extinction, from

Atom scattering from a combination of magnetic quadrupole and homogeneous

and have magnetic fields designed to have constant gradients. Therefore, the
atoms experience position-independent accelerations, and the aberration of the
coherently separated and recombined atomic beams remains small. We find that
because of these properties it is possible to envision an apparatus producing
atomic density gratings with nm-scale periods and large contrasts over 10-100
$\mu $m. We use a new method of describing the atomic interaction with a pulsed

when they have different mode structures. In this paper, the pulsed mode
projection synthesis is developed, the mode structure of interfering lights are
characterized and the effect of this overlap (or mode match) on the fidelity of
optical-state truncation and preparation is investigated. By introducing the
positive-operator-valued measure (POVM) for the detection events in the scheme,
the effect of mode mismatch between the photon-counting detectors and the
incident lights are also presented.

  Rev. A","Phys. Rev. A {\bf 67}, 023814 (2003)","10.1103/PhysRevA.67.023814",,"quant-ph",,"  We show how a medium, under the influece of a coherent control field which is
resonant or close to resonance to an appropriate atomic transition, can lead to
very strong asymmetries in the propagation of unpolarized light when the
direction of the magnetic field is reversed. We show how EIT can be used to
mimic effects occuring in natural systems and that EIT can produce very large
asymmetries as we use electric dipole allowed transitions. Using density matrix
calculations we present results for the breakdown of the magnetic field
reversal symmetry for two different atomic configurations.

quantum states, can close simultaneously arbitrary number of slits preventing
the passage of a single photon in an arbitrary state. A set of K pre- and
post-selected shutters can close the slits preventing the passage of K or less
photons. This result indicates that the surprising properties of pre- and
post-selected quantum systems are even more robust than previously expected.

have two isolated low-lying energy eigenstates, which have the potential to
form the basis of scalable computing elements (qubits). Initialisation,
one-qubit and two-qubit universal gates, and readout are performed using
electrostatic gates and magnetic fields. Two-qubit transformations are
performed via the Coulomb interaction between electrons on adjacent dots.
Choice of initial states and subsequent asymmetric tuning of the tunnelling
energy parameters on adjacent dots control the effect of this interaction.

Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger setups rely on the separate and successive
measurement of the terms involved. We discuss possibilities of experimental
setups to measure all relevant terms simultaneously in a single experiment and
find this to be impossible. One reason is the lack of multi-partite states
which are unique in the sense that a measurement of some observable on one
particle fixes the value of the corresponding observables of the other
particles as well.

One of these equations is the two-component Weyl equation. In this note we give
