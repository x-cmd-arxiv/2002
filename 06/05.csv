most metal-deficient Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies so far detected in 12CO. The
12CO emission is distributed in a horseshoe-like structure that follows the
locus of the most recent star formation regions. The minimum in molecular-line
emission corresponds to the position of an older, massive nuclear starburst.
The H2 mass of the galaxy (in the range 0.4-5x10^7 Msun) and its morphology
have been compared with the predictions of hydrodynamic simulations of the
evolution of the interstellar medium surrounding a nuclear starburst. These
simulations suggest that the physical conditions in the gas swept out by the
starburst could have led to the formation of the ring of molecular gas reported
here. This result provides an attractive scenario for explaining the
propagation (in a galactic scale) of the star formation in dwarf galaxies.

problem with applications to the solar and accretion disk coronae. The main
qualitative features of the evolution (such as field-line expansion and
opening) are considered and a comparison is made between two different
geometrical settings: the Cartesian case with translational symmetry along a
straight line, and the axisymmetric case with axial symmetry around the
rotation axis. The main question addressed in the paper is whether a continuous
sequence of force-free equilibria describes the evolution at arbitrarily large
values of the footpoint displacement or the sequence ends abruptly and the
system exhibits a loss of equilibrium at a finite footpoint displacement. After
a formal description of the problem, a review/discussion of the extensive
previous work on the subject is given. After that, a series of simple
scaling-type arguments, explaining the key essential reason for the main
qualitative difference between the two geometry types, is presented. It is
found that, in the Cartesian case, force-free equilibria exist at arbitrarily
large values of shear and the field approaches the open state only at infinite
shear, whereas in the axisymmetric case the field opens up already at a finite
shear.

as a K-alpha fluorescence emission feature from near-neutral iron. The

triplet of iron is partially resolved. The helium-like triplet component flux
ratios outside of eclipse are consistent with emission from recombination and
subsequent cascades (recombination radiation) from a photoionized plasma. In

that expected for recombination radiation, and are consistent with emission
from a collisionally ionized plasma. The triplet line flux ratios at both
phases can be explained more naturally, however, as emission from a
photoionized plasma if the effects of resonant line scattering are included in
addition to recombination radiation. We show that the emissivity due to
resonant scattering depends sensitively on the line optical depth and, in the
case of winds in X-ray binaries, this allows constraints on the wind velocity
even when Doppler shifts cannot be resolved.

the average observed polarizations are below 0.5%, and none are above 0.9%.
After removal of estimates of the interstellar polarization, about half the
binaries have an intrinsic polarization above 0.5%, even though most of them do
not present other evidences for the presence of circumstellar dust. Various
tests reveal that 77% of the PMS binaries have or possibly have a variable
polarization. LkCa3, Par1540, and Par2494 present detectable periodic and
phase-locked variations. The periodic polarimetric variations are noisier and
of a lesser amplitude (~0.1%) than for other types of binaries, such as hot
stars. This could be due to stochastic events that produce deviations in the
average polarization, a non-favorable geometry (circumbinary envelope), or the
nature of the scatterers (dust grains are less efficient polarizers than
electrons). Par1540 is a Weak-line TTauri Star, but nonetheless has enough dust
in its environment to produce detectable levels of polarization and variations.
A fourth interesting case is W134, which displays rapid changes in polarization
that could be due to eclipses. We compare the observations with some of our
numerical simulations, and also show that an analysis of the periodic
polarimetric variations with the Brown, McLean, & Emslie (BME) formalism to
find the orbital inclination is for the moment premature: non-periodic events
introduce stochastic noise that partially masks the periodic low-amplitude
variations and prevents the BME formalism from finding a reasonable estimate of
the orbital inclination.

have similar properties to their Newtonian counterparts. Just like in Newtonian
MHD they are limits of fast and slow shock solutions and as such they may be
classified as weakly evolutionary shocks. The analysis of Punsly's MHD
waveguide problem shows that its solution cannot have the form of a traveling
step wave and that both fast and Alfv\'en waves are essential for generating
the flow in the guide. Causality considerations are used to argue that the
Blandford-Znajek perturbative solution is in conflict with the membrane
paradigm. An alternative interpretation is presented according to which the
role of an effective unipolar inductor in the Blandford-Znajek mechanism is
played by the ergospheric region of a rotating black hole. Various implications
of this are discussed.

intrinsic linewidth of the gas exceeds one half of the separation of these
quadrupole hyperfine components (~5-10 km/s) these lines blend together and the
observed linewidths greatly overestimate the intrinsic linewidths. If
uncorrected, these artificially broad linewidths will lead to artificially high
opacities. We have observed this effect in our NH3 data from the central 10 pc
of the Galaxy where uncorrected NH3 (1,1) linewidths of ~30 km/s exaggerate the
intrinsic linewidths by more than a factor of two (Genzel & Townes 1987).
Models of the effect of blending on the line profile enable us to solve for the
intrinsic linewidth and opacity of NH3 using the observed linewidth and
intensity of two NH3 rotation inversion transitions. We present the result of
the application of this method to our Galactic Center data. We successfully
recover the intrinsic linewidth and opacity of the gas. Clouds close to the

observationally as being the lowest temperature for which a white dwarf with a
H-rich atmosphere (DA) is known to exhibit periodic brightness variations.
Whether this cut-off in flux variations is actually due to a cessation of
pulsation or merely due to the attenuation of any variations by the convection
zone, rendering them invisible, is not clear. The latter is a theoretical
possibility because with decreasing effective temperature, the emergent flux
variations become an ever smaller fraction of the amplitude of the flux
variations in the interior. In contrast to the flux variations, the visibility
of the velocity variations associated with the pulsations is not thought to be
similarly affected. Thus, models imply that were it still pulsating, a white
dwarf just below the observed red edge should show velocity variations. In
order to test this possibility, we used time-resolved spectra of three DA white
dwarfs that do not show photometric variability, but which have derived
temperatures only slightly lower than the coolest ZZ Ceti variables. We find
that none of our three targets show significant periodic velocity variations,
and set 95% confidence limits on amplitudes of 3.0, 5.2, and 8.8km/s. Thus, for
two out of our three objects, we can rule out velocity variations as large as
5.4km/s observed for the strongest mode in the cool white dwarf pulsator ZZ
Psc. In order to verify our procedures, we also examined similar data of a
known ZZ Ceti, HL Tau 76. Applying external information from the light curve,

a kind of constructive interference of accumulated fluctuations whose impacts
survive longer than the large shocks themselves. As a consequence, the recovery
after an endogeneous shock is in general slower at early times and can be at
long times either slower or faster than after an exogeneous perturbation. This
offers the tantalizing possibility of distinguishing between an endogeneous

for determining whether or not a set of measurements in neutrino oscillation
appearance experiments with approximately monoenergetic beams can completely
resolve these ambiguities. We then use this method to identify experimental
scenarios in which the parameter degeneracies may be efficiently resolved.
Generally speaking, with two appearance measurements degeneracies can occur
over wide areas of the $(\delta,\theta_{13})$ parameter space; with three
measurements they occur along lines in the parameter space and with four
measurements they occur only at isolated points. If two detectors are placed at
the same distance from the source but at different locations with respect to
the main axis of the beam (a detector cluster), each detector will measure
neutrinos at different energies. Then one run with neutrinos and one run with
antineutrinos will give the four independent measurements that in principle can
resolve all of the parameter degeneracies if $\sin^22\theta_{13} \geq 0.002$.
We also examine scenarios with detector clusters using only neutrino beams.

Moreover, the scenario predicts that the main decay mode of proton is from

limit. The realization of gauge coupling unification requires that the cutoff
scale of the scenario must be around the usual GUT scale $\Lambda_G\sim 2\times

perspective of a fluid particle (known as the Lagrangian approach) rather than
in terms of a velocity field (the Eulerian viewpoint). Using a new experimental
technique, based on the scattering of ultrasounds, we have obtained a direct
measurement of particle velocities, resolved at all scales, in a fully
turbulent flow. It enables us to approach intermittency in turbulence from a
dynamical point of view and to analyze the Lagrangian velocity fluctuations in
the framework of random walks. We find experimentally that the elementary steps
in the 'walk' have random uncorrelated directions but a magnitude that is
extremely long-range correlated in time. Theoretically, we study a Langevin
equation that incorporates these features and we show that the resulting
dynamics accounts for the observed one- and two-point statistical properties of
the Lagrangian velocity fluctuations. Our approach connects the intermittent
statistical nature of turbulence to the dynamics of the flow.

B 5, 73 (2003)","10.1088/1464-4266/5/1/310",,"quant-ph",,"  We analyze conditions leading to enhancement of thermal entanglement in
two-qubit XY models. The effect of including cross-product terms, besides the
standard XY exchange interactions, in the presence of an external magnetic
field, is investigated. We show that entanglement can be yield at elevated
temperatures by tuning the orientation of the external magnetic field. The
details of the intrinsic exchange interactions determine the optimal
orientation.

  transparency","2 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.66.033820",,"quant-ph",,"  We analyze the two-photon linewidth of the recently proposed adiabatic
transfer technique for ``stopping'' of light using electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT). We shown that a successful and reliable transfer of
excitation from light to atoms and back can be achieved if the spectrum of the
input probe pulse lies within the initial transparency window of EIT, and if
the two-photon detuning $\delta$ is less than the collective coupling strength
(collective vacuum Rabi-frequency) $g\sqrt{N}$ divided by $\sqrt{\gamma T}$,
with $\gamma$ being the radiative decay rate, $N$ the effective number of atoms
in the sample, and $T$ the pulse duration. Hence in an optically thick medium
light ``storage'' and retrieval is possible with high fidelity even for systems
with rather large two-photon detuning or inhomogeneous broadening.

potential barrier while it is perturbed by either reducing or increasing its

reflection is {\it larger} (superarrivals) while the barrier is {\it lowered}
compared to the unperturbed case. Similarly, during a certain interval of time,
the probability of transmission while the barrier is {\it raised} {\it exceeds}
that for free propagation. We compute {\it particle trajectories} using the
Bohmian model of quantum mechanics in order to understand {\it how} this
phenomenon of superarrivals occurs.

One is the Modified Quantum Plain (MQP) adder, and the other is the Quantum
Carry Look-Ahead (QCLA) adder. The MQP adder is obtained by modifying the
Conventional Quantum Plain (CQP) adder. The QCLA adder is an extension of
conventional digital Carry Look-Ahead adder. Compared with the CQP adder, two
main advantages are as follows: First, the proposed MQP and QCLA adders have
less number of elementary gates than the CQP adder. Secondly, the number of
processing stages of the MQP and QCLA adder are less than ones of the CQP
adder. As a result, the throughput time for computing the sum of two numbers on
the quantum computer can be improved.
