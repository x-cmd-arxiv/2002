distribution of dense, starless molecular cloud cores. Under the hypothesis
that the cores are all either oblate or prolate randomly-oriented spheroids, we
show that a satisfactory fit to observations can be obtained with a gaussian
prolate distribution having a mean intrinsic axis ratio of 0.54. Further, we
show that correlations exist between the apparent axis ratio and both the peak
intensity and total flux density of emission from the cores, the sign of which
again favours the prolate hypothesis. The latter result shows that the mass of
a given core depends on its intrinsic ellipticity. Monte Carlo simulations are
performed to find the best-fit power law of this dependence. Finally, we show
how these results are consistent with an evolutionary scenario leading from
filamentary parent clouds to increasingly massive, condensed, and roughly
spherical embedded cores.

detect a prominent Fe K-alpha emission line, with both broad and narrow
components, and a weaker emission line at 6.9 keV which is probably a
combination of Fe K-beta and Fe XXVI. We interpret the significant deficit of
counts in the soft X-ray region as being due to absorption by ionised gas in
the line of sight. This is demonstrated by the large number of narrow
absorption lines in the RGS spectrum from iron, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, neon,
argon, magnesium, silicon and sulphur. The wide range of iron states present in
the spectrum enables us to deduce the ionisation structure of the absorbing
medium. We find that our spectrum contains evidence of absorption by at least
two phases of gas: a hotter phase containing plasma with a log ionisation
parameter xi (where xi is in erg cm/s) of 2.4 and greater, and a cooler phase
with log xi centred around 0.3. The gas in both phases is outflowing at speeds
of around 800 km/s. The main spectral signature of the cold phase is the
Unresolved Transition Array (UTA) of M-shell iron, which is the deepest yet
observed; its depth requires either that the abundance of iron, in the cold
phase, is several times that of oxygen, with respect to solar abundances, or
that the absorption lines associated with this phase are highly saturated. The
cold phase is associated with ionisation states that would also absorb in the
UV.

hydrodynamics of neutrino-driven winds and nuclear reaction network
calculations of the r-process. As an outer boundary condition of hydrodynamic
calculations, we set a pressure upon the outermost layer of the wind, which is
approaching toward the shock wall. Varying the boundary pressure, we obtain
various asymptotic thermal temperature of expanding material in the
neutrino-driven winds for resulting nucleosynthesis. We find that the
asymptotic temperature slightly lower than those used in the previous studies
of the neutrino-driven winds can lead to a successful r-process abundance
pattern, which is in a reasonable agreement with the solar system r-process
abundance pattern even for the typical proto-neutron star mass Mns ~ 1.4 Msun.
A slightly lower asymptotic temperature reduces the charged particle reaction
rates and the resulting amount of seed elements and lead to a high
neutron-to-seed ratio for successful r-process. This is a new idea which is
different from the previous models of neutrino-driven winds from very massive
(Mns ~ 2.0 Msun) and compact (Rns ~ 10 km) neutron star to get a short
expansion time and a high entropy for a successful r-process abundance pattern.
Although such a large mass is sometimes criticized from observational facts on
a neutron star mass, we dissolve this criticism by reconsidering the boundary
condition of the wind. We also explore the relation between the boundary
condition and neutron star mass, which is related to the progenitor mass, for
successful r-process.

binary stars is the most significant. We find that while the disk-like
populations of the Milky Way are easily constrained in a simultaneous analysis

have applied halo density laws taken from other studies and find that the
Besancon flattened power law halo model (c/a=0.6, r^-2.75) produces the best
fit to our data. With this halo, the thick disk has a scale height of 750 pc
with an 8.5% normalization to the old disk. The old disk scale height is
280-300 pc. Corrected for a binary fraction of 50%, these scale heights are 940
pc and 350-375 pc, respectively. Even with this model, there are systematic
discrepancies between the observed and predicted density distributions. Our
model produces density overpredictions in the inner Galaxy and density
underpredictions in the outer Galaxy. A possible solution is modeling the
stellar halo as a two-component system in which the halo has a flattened inner
distribution and a roughly spherical, but substructured outer distribution.
Further reconciliation could be provided by a flared thick disk, a structure

energy released by stellar winds and SN explosions as well as the X-ray
contribution from SN remnants. The resulting ionizing spectrum (i.e. lambda <
912 A) has been used to compute the expected intensity of the nebular He II
4686 A. The observational ratio He II/Hbeta could be reproduced by the models
assuming that a fraction of the mechanical energy produced by the
star-formation episode is reprocessed by interaction with the ISM as soft X-ray
radiation, contributing to the He ionization. However, the discreteness of the
stellar populations affects the ionizing flux and may be responsible for the
observed dispersion of the ratio. We have finally used the synthesis models to
estimate the contribution of circumnuclear star-forming regions to the
multiwavelength energy distribution in Active Galactic Nuclei, finding that the
UV to soft X-ray continuum in many Seyfert 2 galaxies seems to be dominated by
star-formation processes.

in its CNM concentrations (more than 5 times greater than the median value).
These CNM concentrations lie in an arc on the edge of the source facing the M31

much the same electrostatic considerations as a ``well-tempered'' conventional

oxide thickness needs to be much smaller than the channel length (length of the

rigid molecule with metallic source and drain contacts has a temperature
independent subthreshold slope much larger than 60 mV/decade, because the
metal-induced gap states in the channel prevent it from turning off abruptly.
However, this disadvantage can be overcome by using semiconductor contacts

superfluidity of superfluid $^4$He (He II) results from a reduction in the
number of phonon wavevector $K$ states $\N2(K)$ to a level that is negligibly
low when the fluid is confined e.g. in a narrow channel, yet wider than the
helium atom correlation length, $\Lambda$. This is as a result of the $K$
discretization, a manifestation of the quantum confinement effect (QCE). The
predicted relative viscosity of a confined superfluid has the characteristic
order of magnitude of experimental data ($<10^{-6}$). Furthermore, we show that
at the edges of the resulting energy gaps, the $\N2(K)$ presents discontinuity.
When its corresponding energy exceeds the (first) gap, the superfluid flow
exhibits a critical velocity $v_c$. Our evaluation of $v_c(d)$ versus the
channel width $d$, constrained to satisfy energy conservation, is in good
quantitative agreement with experimental data for channels with $d>10^{-6}$ m.
Meanwhile, a sharp turn about $K\propto$ $ v_c$ in $\N2(K)$ resembles very well
that of the experimental overshoot data. For narrower channels of $d<10^{-6}$ m
$\le \Lambda$ in which the phonon excitation picture becomes inadequate, we
instead represent the excitation in terms of single atoms with an effective
mass, which yields a $v_c(d)$ in close agreement with experiment. Accordingly,
the reduction in the number of atomic states results in superfluidity. The
theoretical finding in this work, which can be termed the {\bf QCE
superfluidity mechanism}, provides a consistent explanation for this puzzling
phenomenon, the non-dissipative, superfluidity motion, of He II and could have
a significant impact also on the understanding of other superfluids.

PdNiCuP is characterized by a dense packing with a packing fraction above 0.5.
The intermediate scattering function exhibits a fast relaxation process that
precedes structural relaxation. Structural relaxation obeys a time-temperature
superposition that extends over a temperature range of 540K. The mode-coupling
theory of the liquid to glass transition (MCT) gives a consistent description
of the dynamics which governs the mass transport in liquid PdNiCuP alloys. MCT
scaling laws extrapolate to a critical temperature Tc at about 20% below the
liquidus temperature. Diffusivities derived from the mean relaxation times
compare well with Co diffusivities from recent tracer diffusion measurements
and diffsuivities calculated from viscosity via the Stokes-Einstein relation.
In contrast to simple metallic liquids, the atomic transport in dense, liquid
PdNiCuP is characterized by a drastical slowing down of dynamics on cooling, a
q^{-2} dependence of the mean relaxation times at intermediate q and a
vanishing isotope effect as a result of a highly collective transport
mechanism. At temperatures as high as 2Tc diffusion in liquid PdNiCuP is as
fast as in simple liquids at the melting point. However, the difference in the
underlying atomic transport mechanism indicates that the diffusion mechanism in

two dimensions, coupled via an {\it infinite-range interaction} gauged by a

trapped in a unique cluster. At higher energy it exhibits a transition towards
a homogenous phase. For sufficiently strong coupling $A$ an intermediate phase
characterized by two clusters appears. Depending on the value of $A$ the
observed transitions can be either second or first order in the canonical
ensemble. In the latter case microcanonical results differ dramatically from
canonical ones. However, a canonical analysis, extended to metastable and
unstable states, is able to describe the microcanonical equilibrium phase. In
particular, a microcanonical negative specific heat regime is observed in the
proximity of the transition whenever it is canonically discontinuous. In this
regime, {\it microcanonically stable} states are shown to correspond to {\it
saddles} of the Helmholtz free energy, located inside the spinodal region.

5,000 gauge configurations at each temperature. We then measure the pole-mass

a significant pole-mass reduction of about 300 MeV near T_c or m_G(T\simeq T_c)

the Breit-Wigner form for the spectral function rho(omega), we perform the

asymmetry $\epsilon_1$ on the one hand, and the $\beta\beta_{0\nu}$ decay
parameter $m_{ee}$ on the other hand. {\it However, leptogenesis is insensitive
to the neutrino oscillation phase}. We find lower bounds $M_{N_1}\gsim 10^{10}$
GeV for the normal light-neutrino mass hierarchy, and $M_{N_1}\gsim 10^{11}$
GeV for the inverted mass hierarchy, respectively, indicating a potentially
serious conflict with the gravitino problem. Depending on $M_{N_1}$, we find
upper (upper and lower bounds) on the lightest active neutrino mass for the
normal (inverted) mass hierarchy, and a lower bound on $m_{ee}$ even for the
normal mass ordering. The low-energy lepton-flavour- and CP-violating
observables induced by renormalization are almost independent of leptogenesis.

$d_e\sim 10^{-(27-28)}$ e cm in our numerical examples, while $d_\mu$ may reach

integral to a surface integral. Then we convert the Yang-Mills theory with an
insertion of the Wilson loop operator into a bosonic string theory with a
rigidity term by way of an equivalent antisymmetric tensor gauge theory which
couples to the surface spanned by the Wilson loop. This result suggests an
intimate relationship between quark confinement and mass gap in Yang-Mills
theory. In fact, the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory describing the dual

particularly for investigating physical observables of the type $F(Q^2)$ in
regions that are inaccessible to perturbative methods of quantum field theory.
This approach directly links the infrared (IR) and the ultraviolet(UV) regions
together under the causal analyticity requirement in the complex $Q^2-$plane.
Due to the inclusion of crucial non-perturbative effects, the running coupling
in our model not only excludes unphysical singularities but also freezes to a
finite value at the IR limit $Q^2=0$. This makes it consistent with a popular
phenomenological hypothesis, namely the IR freezing phenomenon. Applying this
model to compute the Gluon condensate, we obtain a result that is in good
agreement with the most recent phenomenological estimate. Having calculated the
$\beta-$function corresponding to our QCD coupling constant, we find that it
behaves qualitatively like its perturbative counterpart, when calculated beyond
the leading order and with a number of quark flavours allowing for the
occurrence of IR fixed points.

constants of motion. In contrast to two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, where a
second inviscid invariant--the enstrophy--blocks the energy cascade to small
scales, in 3D there is a joint cascade of both energy and helicity
simultaneously to small scales. The basic cancellation mechanism which permits
a joint cascade of energy and helicity is illuminated by means of the helical
decomposition of the velocity into positively and negatively polarized waves.
This decomposition is employed in the present study both theoretically and also
in a numerical simulation of homogeneous and isotropic 3D turbulence. It is
shown that the transfer of energy to small scales produces a tremendous growth
of helicity separately in the + and - helical modes at high wavenumbers,
diverging in the limit of infinite Reynolds number. However, because of a
tendency to restore reflection invariance at small scales, the net helicity
from both modes remains finite in that limit. The net helicity flux is shown to
be constant all the way up to the Kolmogorov wavenumber: there is no shorter
inertial-range for helicity cascade than for energy cascade. The transfer of
energy and helicity between + and - modes, which permits the joint cascade, is
shown to be due to two distinct physical processes, advection and vortex
stretching.

such as fermions in a small single-j shell and d boson systems, is given. This
method is generalized to predict P(I)'s of more complicated cases, such as even

sd-boson or sdg-boson systems, etc. By this method we are able to tell which

argument on the microscopic foundation of our approach, and certain matrix
elements which are useful to understand the observed regularities, are also

complex growth patterns in vitro in which invasive cells organize in tenuous

element controlling the pattern is homotype attraction, i.e., the tendency for
invasive cells to follow pathways previously explored. We investigate this in
two ways: we show that there is an intrinsic instability in the model, which
leads to branch formation. We also give a discrete description for the
expansion of the invasive zone, and a continuum model for the nutrient supply.
The results indicate that both, strong heterotype chemotaxis and strong
homotype chemo-attraction are required for branch formation within the invasive

using a rather simple quantum equation to describe the decoherence effects due
to dissipation. Namely, the mere introduction (not of a ""time-lattice"", but
simply) of a ""chronon"" allows us to go on from differential to
finite-difference equations; and in particular to write down the
quantum-theoretical equations (Schroedinger equation, Liouville--von Neumann

functions (as compared to private-coin protocols), shared entanglement leads to
startling phenomena such as ``quantum teleportation'' and ``superdense

  The problem of characterising the power of prior entanglement has puzzled
many researchers. In this paper, we revisit the problem of transmitting
classical bits over an entanglement-assisted quantum channel. We derive a new,
optimal bound on the number of quantum bits required for this task, for any
given probability of error. All known lower bounds in the setting of bounded
error entanglement-assisted communication are based on sophisticated
information theoretic arguments. In contrast, our result is derived from first
principles, using a simple linear algebraic technique.

system conditioned on continuous monitoring of its output, such as by an ideal
photodetector. In practice an experimenter has access to an output filtered
through various electronic devices, rather than the microscopic states of the
detector. This introduces several imperfections into the measurement process,
of which only inefficiency has previously been incorporated into quantum
trajectory theory. However, all electronic devices have finite bandwidths, and
the consequent delay in conveying the output signal to the observer implies
that the evolution of the conditional state of the quantum system must be
non-Markovian. We present a general method of describing this evolution and
apply it to avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and to photoreceivers. We include the
effects of efficiency, dead time, bandwidth, electronic noise, and dark counts.
The essential idea is to treat the quantum system and classical detector
jointly, and to average over the latter to obtain the conditional quantum
state.
  The significance of our theory is that quantum trajectories for realistic
detection are necessary for sophisticated approaches to quantum feedback, and
our approach could be applied in many areas of physics.

avalanche photodiodes and photoreceivers. In this paper we present simulations
of these realistic quantum trajectories for a cavity QED scenario in order to
ascertain how the conditioned state varies from that obtained with perfect
detection. Large differences are found, and this is manifest in the average of
the conditional purity. Simulation also allows us to comprehensively
investigate how the quality of the the photoreceiver depends upon its physical
parameters. In particular, we present evidence that in the limit of small
electronic noise, the photoreceiver quality can be characterized by an {\em
effective} bandwidth, which depends upon the level of electronic noise and the
filter bandwidth. We establish this result as an appropriate limit for a
simpler, analytically solvable, system. We expect this to be a general result
