into account perturbations from other galaxies. Using a simple linear formalism

shear is quantified by introducing a `critical shear' gamma_c as a measure for
the amount of shear that changes the result significantly. The analysis shows,

lens galaxy. We discuss these results and compare with numerical models for a

at least 0.1% of the galaxy's V luminosity. We have also discovered a halo of
old (> ~2 Gyr) stars surrounding Leo A, with a scale length roughly 50% larger

median absolute magnitude of our Cepheid sample is M_V = -1.1, fainter than 96%

Cepheids that are deduced to be pulsating in the fundamental mode having
periods of under 1 day. Upon examination, these characteristics of the Leo A
Cepheid population appear to be a natural extension of the classical Cepheid
period-luminosity relations to low metallicity, rather than being indicative of
a large population of ``anomalous'' Cepheids. We demonstrate that the periods
and luminosities are consistent with the expected values of low-metallicity
blue helium-burning stars (BHeBs), which populate the instability strip at

showing W-R features are drawn from our previous work on extragalactic HII

wind consists of a slow outflow that is bounded on the polar side by a fast
stream. We find that these two components of the wind produce distinct spectral
features. The fast stream produces profiles which show features consistent with
observations. These include the appearance of the P-Cygni shape for a range of
inclinations, the location of the maximum depth of the absorption component at
velocities less than the terminal velocity, and the transition from absorption
to emission with increasing inclination. However the model profiles have too
little absorption or emission equivalent width. This quantitative difference
between our models and observations is not a surprise because the line-driven
wind models predict a mass loss rate that is lower than the rate required by
the observations. We note that the model profiles exhibit a double-humped
structure near the line center which is not echoed in observations. We identify
this structure with a non-negligible redshifted absorption which is formed in
the slow component of the wind where the rotational velocity dominates over

estimates of ~1 per million years per galaxy, and optimistic theoretical
estimates one or more magnitude larger. Formation rates of low-mass black
hole-neutron star binaries may be higher than those of NS-NS binaries, and may
dominate the detectable LIGO signal rate.
  We estimate the enhanced coalescence rate for BH-BH binaries due to weak
asymmetric kicks during the formation of low mass black holes like Nova Sco,
and find they may contribute significantly to the LIGO signal rate, possibly
dominating the phase I detectable signals if the range of BH masses for which
there is significant kick is broad enough. For a standard Salpeter IMF,
assuming mild natal kicks, we project that the R6 merger rate of BH-BH systems
is ~0.5, smaller than that of NS-NS systems. However, the higher chirp mass of
these systems produces a signal nearly four times greater, on average, with a
commensurate increase in search volume.
  The BH-BH coalescence channel considered here also predicts that a
substantial fraction of BH-BH systems should have at least one component with
near-maximal spin (a/M ~ 1).The waveforms produced by the coalescence of such a

range 10<l<800, at several frequencies between 0.4 and 2.7 GHz and at several
Galactic latitudes up to near the North Galactic Pole. Electric- and
magnetic-parity polarization spectra are found to have slopes around alpha
_{E,B} = 1.4 - 1.5 in the Parkes and Effelsberg Galactic-Plane surveys, but
strong local fluctuations of alpha_{E,B} are found at | b | ~ 10 degree from
the 1.4 GHz Effelsberg survey. The C_{PIl} spectrum, which is insensitive to
the polarization direction, is somewhat steeper, being alpha_{PI} = 1.6 - 1.8
for the same surveys. The low-resolution multifrequency survey of Brouw and
Spoelstra (1976) shows some flattening of the spectra below 1 GHz, more intense
for C_{E,Bl} than for C_{PIl}. In no case we find evidence for really steep
spectra. The extrapolation to the cosmological window shows that at 90 GHz the
detection of E-mode harmonics in the cosmic background radiation should not be
disturbed by synchrotron, even around l~10 for a reionization optical depth tau

galaxies with Hubble types ranging from E to Sbc. Spectral indices, based on
the Lick system, are measured in the optical and near infra-red (NIR). The 24
indices measured, in conjunction with models of the effects of varying
abundance ratios, permit the breaking of age/metallicity degeneracy and allow
estimation of enhancements in specific light elements (particularly C and Mg).
The large range of Hubble types observed allows direct comparison of
line-strengths in the centres of early-type galaxies (E and S0) with those in
spiral bulges, free from systematic differences that have plagued comparisons
of results from different studies. Our sample includes field and Virgo cluster
galaxies. For early-type galaxies our data are consistent with previously
reported trends of Mg2 and Mgb with velocity dispersion. In spiral bulges we
find trends in all indices with velocity dispersion. We estimate
luminosity-weighted ages, metallicities and heavy element abundance
ratios(enhancements) from optical indices. These show that bulges are less
enhanced in light (alpha-capture) elements and have lower average age than
early-type galaxies. Trends involving age and metallicity also differ sharply
between early and late types. An anti-correlation exists between age and
metallicity in early types, while, in bulges, metallicity is correlated with
velocity dispersion. We consider the implications of these findings for models
of the formation of these galaxies. We find that primordial collapse models of
galaxy formation are ruled out by our observations, while several predictions
of hierarchical clustering (merger) models are confirmed.

determine the stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratio in a galactic disk. The stars
are seen without a dust screen, the central gas mass is very low (undetected),
and we show that the dark matter is negligible in the central regions. We have
developed an axisymmetric analytical gravitational potential model to account
for the central light (mass) profile, the dynamics of the molecular gas in the
highly obscured molecular ring, and the stellar light profile outside the
highly obscured region. The contribution of dark matter is constrained by the
extremely extended HI rotation curve and is small, possibly negligible, at
distances less than 5 -- 7 kpc from the center. Furthermore, the M/L ratios we
derive are low, about 1.5 in I band and 0.5 in K' band. The B and V band M/L
ratios vary greatly due to absorption by dust, reaching 4 in the molecular ring
and decreasing to about 1.6 -- 1.8 at larger radii. This unequivocally shows
that models, like most maximum disk models, assuming constant M/L ratios in an
optical waveband, simply are not appropriate. We illustrate this by making mock
maximum disk models with a constant V band M/L ratio. The key is having the
central light distribution unobscured such that it can be used to trace the
mass. A primitive attempt to determine the intrinsic M/L ratio yields values
close to unity in the B,V, and I bands and slightly below 0.5 in K'.

higher than 5x10^(-12) erg/cm^2/s. The good statistics available and the broad
energy band permit a detailed study of the main continuum components of these
sources, i.e. the primary power-law, the reflected component, the soft emission
and the high-energy cut-off. The main results of our analysis are: (1) the
3-200 keV intrinsic power-law has a mean photon index Gamma=1.79+-0.01, with a
dispersion of sigma=0.23. (2) The high-energy exponential cut-off at E~100-300
keV is not an ubiquitous property of Seyfert galaxies: in ~30% of the objects
the continuum power-law does not drop up to energies of 300 keV or more. (3) A
reflected component is present in almost all the sources (17 out of 21). The
small variations of this component with respect to the intrinsic continuum, in
objects with multiple observations, suggests that the reflector is not the
accretion disk, but must be located much farther from the nucleus. (4) The
range of ratios between the reflected and intrinsic components suggests that
the circumnuclear medium is not homogeneous, and a significant fraction of the
solid angle is covered by a gas thicker than that along the line of sight. (5)
The iron Kalpha line is present is all but one the sources. The equivalent
width is in the typical range of Seyfert 1s (EW=100-300 eV) in sources with low
absorption (N_H < 3x10^23 cm^(-2)), and increases in more absorbed objects, as
expected according to unified models. (6) The energy resolution of BeppoSAX is
in general too low to measure the iron line width. However, in 6 cases we
measured a significant line broadening.

addition to reproducing the even-odd behavior in the transmission probability

is larger in the even-numbered atomic wire than in the odd-numbered wire. (ii)
The Andreev conductance displays the same even-odd parity effects in the

is higher in the odd-numbered atomic wire than in the even-numbered wire. When
the number of sites ($N$) is odd and the atomic wire is mirror symmetric with
respect to the center of the atomic wire, the conductance does not depend on
the details of the hopping matrices in the atomic wire, but is solely

almost independent of the alloy composition, lattice spacing, and crystal

semi-infinite electrodes in a very generic and efficient way by means of Bethe
lattices. We name this method the Gaussian Embedded Cluster Method (GECM). In

technique by calculating the conductance in some well-studied systems such as
metallic (Al and Au) nanocontacts and C-atom chains connected to metallic (Al
and Au) electrodes. In the case of Al nanocontacts the conductance turns out to
be quite dependent on the detailed atomic arrangement. On the contrary, the
conductance in Au nanocontacts presents quite universal features. In the case
of C chains, where the self-consistency guarantees the local charge transfer
and the correct alignment of the molecular and electrode levels, we find that
the conductance oscillates with the number of atoms in the chain regardless of
the type of electrode. However, for short chains and Al electrodes the even-odd

We begin with a brief discussion of astrophysical sources of gravitational

interferometers, such as GEO, LIGO, VIRGO. Then, we proceed to relic
gravitational waves emphasizing their quantum-mechanical origin and the
inevitability of their existence. Combining the theory with available
observations, we discuss the prospects of direct detection of relic
gravitational waves. A considerable part of the paper is devoted to comparison
of relic gravitational waves with the density perturbations of
quantum-mechanical origin. It is shown how the phenomenon of squeezing of
quantum-mechanically generated cosmological perturbations manifests itself in
the periodic structures of the metric power spectra and in the oscillatory
behaviour of the CMBR multipoles $C_l$ as a function of $l$. The cosmological
importance of the theoretically calculated (statistical) dipole moment $C_1$ is

mass, $m_\Phi$, and positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$, define two
extremely different scales. The models under consideration are consistent with
the known experimental facts if $m_\Phi > 10^{-3} eV$ and
$\Lambda=\Lambda^{obs}\sim 10^{-56} cm^{-2}$. 2) Einstein week equivalence
principle is strictly satisfied and extended to scalar-tensor theories of
gravity using a novel form of principle of ""constancy of fundamental
constants"". 3) The dilaton plays simultaneously role of inflation field and
quintessence field and yields a sequential hyper-inflation with graceful exit
to asymptotic de Sitter space-time which is an attractor, and is approached as
$\exp(-\sqrt{3\Lambda^{obs}} ct/2)$. The time duration of inflation is $\Delta
t_{infl} \sim m_\Phi^{-1}$. 4) Ultra-high frequency ($\omega_\Phi \sim m_\Phi$)
dilatonic oscillations take place in asymptotic regime. 5) No fine tuning. (The
Robertson-Walker solutions of general type have the above properties.) 6) A
novel adjustment mechanism for cosmological constant problem seems to be
possible: the huge value of cosmological constant in the stringy frame is
re-scaled to its observed value by dilaton after transition to phenomenological
frame.

also examine the possibilities of Hawking-Page type thermal phase transitions

one observes a Hawking-Page phase transition only if the event horizon is a
hypersurface of positive constant curvature (k=1). But, with the Gauss-Bonnet
or/and the (Riemann)^2 interaction terms, there may occur a similar phase
transition for a horizon of negative constant curvature (k=-1). We examine the
finite coupling effects, and find that N>5 could trigger a Hawking-Page phase
transition in the latter theory. For the Gauss-Bonnet black holes, one relates
the entropy of the black hole to a variation of the geometric property of the
horizon based on first law and Noether charge. With (Riemann)^2 term, however,
we can do this only approximately, and the two results agree when, r_H>>L, the
size of the horizon is much bigger than the AdS curvature scale. We establish
some relations between bulk data associated with the AdS black hole and
boundary data defined on the horizon of the AdS geometry. Following a heuristic
approach, we estimate the difference between Hubble entropy {\cal S}_H and
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy {\cal S}_{BH} with (Riemann)^2 term, which, for k=0

if the pure point component of the limit measure has support on a finite number
of such orbits, then the mass of this component must be smaller than two thirds

  using a general form of the grand canonical partition function","28 pages including 6 figures. Submitted to PRC",,,,"nucl-th hep-ph",,"  Various phenomenological models of particle multiplicity distributions are
discussed using a general form of the grand canonical partition function. These
phenomenological models include a wide range of varied processes such as
coherent emission or Poisson processes, chaotic emission resulting in a
negative binomial distribution, combinations of coherent and chaotic processes
called signal/noise distributions, and models based on field emission from
Lorentzian line shapes leading to Lorentz/Catalan distributions. These specific
cases can be written as special cases of a more general distribution. Using
this grand canonical approach moments and cumulants, combinants, hierarchical
structure, void scaling relations, KNO scaling features, clan variables and
branching laws associated with stochastic or ancestral variables are discussed.
It is shown that just looking at the mean and fluctuation of data is not enough
to distinguish these distributions or the underlying mechanism. A
generalization of the Poisson transform of a distribution and the Poissonian
decomposition of it into a compound or sequential process is also given.

are there three bases per codon in the translation to protein process. As a
followup to our previous work, we approach this problem by considering the
translocation properties of primitive molecular machines, which capture basic
features of ribosomal/messenger RNA interactions, while operating under
prebiotic conditions. Our model consists of a short one-dimensional chain of
charged particles(rRNA antecedent) interacting with a polymer (mRNA antecedent)
via electrostatic forces. The chain is subject to external forcing that causes
it to move along the polymer which is fixed in a quasi one dimensional
geometry. Our numerical and analytic studies of statistical properties of
random chain/polymer potentials suggest that, under very general conditions, a
dynamics is attained in which the chain moves along the polymer in steps of
three monomers. By adjusting the model in order to consider present day genetic
sequences, we show that the above property is enhanced for coding regions.
Intergenic sequences display a behavior closer to the random situation. We
argue that this dynamical property could be one of the underlying causes for
the three base codon structure of the genetic code.

Schr\""odinger equations generate quantum trajectories for the system state
conditioned on continuously monitoring the bath. For a given master equation,
there are many different unravelings, corresponding to different sorts of
measurement on the bath. In this paper we address the non-Markovian case, and
in particular the sort of stochastic \sch equation introduced by Strunz, Di\'
osi, and Gisin [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 1801 (1999)]. Using a quantum measurement
theory approach, we rederive their unraveling which involves complex-valued
Gaussian noise. We also derive an unraveling involving real-valued Gaussian
noise. We show that in the Markovian limit, these two unravelings correspond to
heterodyne and homodyne detection respectively. Although we use quantum
measurement theory to define these unravelings, we conclude that the stochastic
evolution of the system state is not a true quantum trajectory, as the identity
of the state through time is a fiction.
