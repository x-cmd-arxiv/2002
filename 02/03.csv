deviate from the TF relation based on Arecibo single-dish observations. We do
not detect three of the four targeted LSB galaxies in HI down to a 4-sigma
limit of 0.08Jy km/s. We find that two of the four of these LSBs have bright
galaxies which have contaminated the Arecibo signal. A further examination of
the Arecibo sample shows that five out of the six galaxies that were found to
deviate from TF have nearby bright galaxies and we conclude that possibly all
but one of the non-TF galaxies are contaminated by HI from nearby galaxies. The
sixth galaxy was not detected by us. A new observation by Arecibo did not
confirm the earlier detection. The integrated profiles of the bright galaxies
are consistent with the Arecibo results both in velocity range and amplitude,
which indicates that most of the extreme deviators from the TF relation must
have been affected by bright companions in this earlier HI survey. A more
recent determination of the sidelobe structure of the Arecibo beam supports our
conclusion and shows that the degree of sidelobe contamination was much larger
than could have been initially predicted. Hence, we have corrected the results
found in O'Neil et al. (2000) and have reconstructed the TF relation. These new
observations then show a) a reconstructed TF relation that has relatively large
scatter at all values of rotational velocity (possibly indicating the true
range in disk galaxy properties) and b) the presence of at least some red, gas
poor, LSB disks that indeed may be in an advanced evolutionary state as the
faded remnants of their former high surface brightness actively star forming
state.

system containing more than two planets, all planets will affect the central
region of the magnification pattern, and thus the existence of the multiple
planets can be inferred by detecting additionally deformed anomalies from
intensive monitoring of high magnification events. Unfortunately, this method
has important limitations in identifying the existence of multiple planets and
determining their parameters due to the degeneracy of the resulting light curve
anomalies from those induced by a single planet and the complexity of multiple
planet lensing models. In this paper, we propose a new channel to search for
multiple planets via microlensing. The method is based on the fact that the
anomalies induced by multiple planets are well approximated by the
superposition of those of the single planet systems where the individual
planet-primary pairs act as independent lens systems. Then, if the source
trajectory passes both of the outer deviation regions induced by the individual
planets, one can unambiguously identify the existence of the multiple planets.
We illustrate that the probability of successively detecting light curve
anomalies induced by two Jovian-mass planets located in the lensing zone
through this channel will be substantial. Since the individual anomalies can be
well modeled by much simpler single planet lensing models, the proposed method
has an important advantage of allowing one to accurately determine the
parameters of the individual planets.

estimated to have one of the highest collision rates of any galactic globular
cluster, making its core a particularly conducive environment for the
production of interacting binary systems. We have reconstructed high-resolution
images of the central 19""x19"" region of Terzan 5 by application of the drizzle
algorithm to dithered NIC2 images in the F110W, F187W, and F187N near-infrared
filters. We have used a DAOPHOT/ALLSTAR analysis of these images to produce the
deepest color-magnitude diagram (CMD) yet obtained for the core of Terzan 5. We
have also analyzed the parallel 11""X11"" NIC1 field, centered 30"" from the
cluster center and imaged in F110W and F160W, and an additional NIC2 field that
is immediately adjacent to the central field. This imaging results in a clean
detection of the red-giant branch and horizontal branch in the central NIC2
field, and the detection of these plus the main-sequence turnoff and the upper
main sequence in the NIC1 field. We have constructed an H versus J-H CMD for
the NIC1 field. We obtain a new distance estimate of 8.7 kpc, which places
Terzan 5 within less than 1 kpc of the galactic center. We have also determined
a central surface-density profile which results in a maximum likelihood
estimate of 7.9"" +/- 0.6"" for the cluster core radius. We discuss the
implications of these results for the dynamical state of Terzan 5.

collapsing prestellar cores via numerical chemical models, adopting the
Larson-Penston solution and its delayed analogues to study collapse. Molecular
abundances and distributions in a collapsing core are determined by the balance
among the dynamical, chemical and adsorption time scales. When the central
density n_H of a prestellar core with the Larson-Penston flow rises to 3 10^6
cm^{-3}, the CCS and CO column densities are calculated to show central holes
of radius 7000 AU and 4000 AU, respectively, while the column density of N2H+
is centrally peaked. These predictions are consistent with observations of
L1544. If the dynamical time scale of the core is larger than that of the
Larson-Penston solution owing to magnetic fields, rotation, or turbulence, the
column densities of CO and CCS are smaller, and their holes are larger than in
the Larson-Penston core with the same central gas density. On the other hand,
N2H+ and NH3 are more abundant in the more slowly collapsing core. Therefore,
molecular distributions can probe the collapse time scale of prestellar cores.
Deuterium fractionation has also been studied via numerical calculations. The
deuterium fraction in molecules increases as a core evolves and molecular
depletion onto grains proceeds. When the central density of the core is n_H=3
10^6 cm^{-3}, the ratio DCO+/HCO+ at the center is in the range 0.06-0.27,
depending on the collapse time scale and adsorption energy; this range is in

Fractionation is caused by rapid exchange reactions that are exothermic because
of energy differences between deuterated and normal species. In the midplane
region, where molecules are heavily depleted onto grain surfaces, the D/H
ratios of gaseous molecules are higher than at larger heights. The D/H ratios
for the vertical column densities of NH3, H2O, and HCO+ are sensitive to the
temperature, and decrease significantly with decreasing radial distance for R <
300 AU. The analogous D/H ratios for CH4 and H2CO, on the other hand, are not
very sensitive to the temperature in the range (T=10-50 K) we are concerned
with, and do not decrease with decreasing R at R > 50 AU. The D/H
column-density ratios also depend on disk mass. In a disk with a larger mass,
the ratios of deuterated species to normal species are higher, because of
heavier depletion of molecules onto grains. In the second part of the paper, we
report molecular column densities for disks embedded in ambient cloud gas. Our
results suggest that CN and HCO+ can be tracers of gaseous disks, especially if
the central object is a strong X-ray source. Our results also suggest that the
radial distributions of CN, C2H, HCN, and H2CO may vary among disks depending
on the X-ray luminosity of the central star.

pulses in solution of alanine. It appears that no experimental realization of
Fredkin gate with fewer pulses has yet been reported up to now. In addition,
the simple structure of our scheme makes it easy to be implemented in
experiments.

neurons have quantum links with one another in a chosen way and affect one
another in a fashion analogous to action potentials. We have examined the role
of stochasticity introduced by the quantum potential and compare the system
with the classical system of an integrate-and-fire model by Hopfield. Average
periodicity and short term retentivity of input memory are noted.

neurons with deterministic states, and also with quantum operators replacing
teh classical action potentials. With our choice of gates interconnecting teh
neural lattice, it appears that the state of the system behaves in ways
reflecting both the strengths of coupling between neurons as well as initial
conditions. We find that depending whether there is a threshold for emission
from excited to ground state, the system shows either aperiodic oscillations or
coherent ones with periodicity depending on the strength of coupling.

of plane parallel plates made of real metals. The thermal corrections to the
Casimir force between real metals were recently computed by several authors
using different approaches based on the Lifshitz formula with diverse results.
Both the Drude and plasma models were used to describe a real metal. We
calculate the entropy density of photons between metallic plates as a function
of the surface separation and temperature. Some of these approaches are
demonstrated to lead to negative values of entropy and to nonzero entropy at
zero temperature depending on the parameters of the system. The conclusion is
that these approaches are in contradiction with the third law of thermodynamics
and must be rejected. It is shown that the plasma dielectric function in
combination with the unmodified Lifshitz formula is in perfect agreement with
the general principles of thermodynamics. As to the Drude dielectric function,
the modification of the zero-frequency term of the Lifshitz formula is outlined
that not to violate the laws of thermodynamics.
