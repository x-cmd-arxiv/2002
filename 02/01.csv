parameters, varying the baryonic fraction, the gas metallicity, the
meta-galactic UV field, the cosmology, the dark matter type, and also the
numerical resolution. The models are found to be in agreement with the (few)
relevant X-ray observations available at present. The amount of hot gas in the
haloes is also consistent with constraints from pulsar dispersion measures in
the Milky Way. Forthcoming XMM and Chandra observations should enable much more
stringent tests and provide constraints on the physical parameters. We find
that simple cooling flow models over-predict X-ray luminosities by up to two
orders of magnitude for high (but still realistic) cooling efficiencies
relative to the models presented here. Our results display a clear trend that
increasing cooling efficiency leads to decreasing X-ray luminosities at z=0.
The reason is found to be that increased cooling efficiency leads to a
decreased fraction of hot gas relative to total baryonic mass inside of the
virial radius at present. At gas metal abundances of a third solar this hot gas
fraction becomes as low as just a few percent. We also find that most of the
X-ray emission comes from the inner parts (inner about 20 kpc) of the hot
galactic haloes. Finally, we find for realistic choices of the physical
parameters that disc galaxy haloes possibly were more than one order of
magnitude brighter in soft X-ray emission at z=1, than at present.

matter halo. We report results obtained with two independent, state-of-the-art,
multi-stepping, parallel N-body codes: PKDGRAV and GADGET. We find that
convergent mass profiles can be obtained for suitable choices of the
gravitational softening, timestep, force accuracy, initial redshift, and
particle number. For softenings chosen so that particle discreteness effects
are negligible, convergence in the circular velocity is obtained at radii where
the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the timestep is much shorter than
the local orbital timescale; (ii) accelerations do not exceed a characteristic
acceleration imprinted by the gravitational softening; and (iii) enough
particles are enclosed so that the collisional relaxation timescale is longer
than the age of the universe. The most stringent requirement for convergence is
typically that imposed on the particle number by the collisional relaxation
criterion, which implies that in order to estimate accurate circular velocities
at radii where the density contrast may reach $\sim 10^6$, the region must
enclose of order 3000 particles (or more than a few times $10^6$ within the
virial radius). Applying these criteria to a galaxy-sized $\Lambda$CDM halo, we
find that the spherically-averaged density profile becomes progressively
shallower from the virial radius inwards, reaching a logarithmic slope
shallower than -1.2 at the innermost resolved point, $r \sim 0.005 r_{200}$,
with little evidence for convergence to a power-law behaviour in the inner
regions.

smaller Chandra X-ray error circle excludes the only other blue stars
previously identified in the old Einstein circle. We have also obtained Hubble
Space Telescope/STIS time-resolved optical spectra of star U1. Although there
are no strong line features, the flux distribution demonstrates U1 to be
unusually bright in the blue and faint in the red, consistent with earlier
WFPC2 photometry. More notably, the flux level of the continuum is seen to vary
significantly compared to stars of similar brightness. Indeed, the lightcurve
can plausibly be fit by a 5.73 hr period sinusoid, which is the period of the
recurring X-ray dips seen in this source. The presence of modulations in both

the puzzle of the unusual energy independent X-ray dips. Lastly, we note that

fundamental structure of matter, gravity, and how the Universe formed.

for the first time with Chandra), and 23 within the inner 60 arcsec (including
the bar). The luminosity distributions of the sources in the inner 60 arcsec
region (nucleus and stellar bar) is a single power law, which we interpret as
due to continuous, ongoing star formation. Outside this inner region, there is
a smaller fraction of bright sources, which we interpret as evidence of an
aging population from a past episode of star formation. About 50% of the total
emission in the nuclear region is unresolved; of this, about 70% can be
attributed to hot thermal plasma, and we interpret the rest as due to
unresolved point sources (eg, faint X-ray binaries). The unresolved X-ray

In the nuclear region, the electron temperature of the thermal plasma is = 0.58
keV. In the spiral arms, the thermal component is at kT = 0.31 keV and a
power-law component dominates at energies >~1 keV. The high abundance of C, Ne,

a galaxy image into a series of orthogonal basis functions, or `shapelets'. Our
choice of basis functions, namely the Gauss-Hermite series, has a number of
remarkable properties under distortions, convolutions and noise, which makes
them particularly well suited for astrophysical applications. In particular, we
describe how they can be used to measure the shear induced by weak
gravitational lensing, with the precision required for upcoming surveys. We
also show how shapelets can be used to reconstruct images from interferometric
observations. Other application of shapelets, such as image compression, PSF
deconvolution, de-projection and the study of galaxy morphology, are also
briefly discussed.

galaxies in the local universe, we are able to measure in a highly homogeneous
way photometric and structural properties for a sample of 1143 galaxies. We
base our analysis on a quantitative structural parameter, the concentration
index C_31, instead of relying on the galaxies' morphological classification.
The C_31 parameter provides a model independent, quantitative and continuous
characterization of the light distribution within galaxies, and it is thus to
be preferred to either the Hubble type or a parameter like the bulge-to-disk or
bulge-to-total light ratio. We find that galaxies can be completely described
by three parameters, namely: a scale parameter (the H-band luminosity), a shape
parameter (the concentration index C_31) and a colour parameter (e.g. the B-H
colour). At low luminosity dEs and dIs, having similar C_31, are
colour-discriminated, while at very high luminosity different C_31 discriminate
S0s from Scs, otherwise undistinguishable on the basis of their colour. A
single, monotonic relation exists between luminosity and mu_e in the H-band, as
opposed to the two separate regimes that are generally observed in the B-band.
As NIR luminosity traces quite accurately the galaxy mass distribution, this
relation re-enforces the indication in favour of a scale-dependent mass
collapse mechanism which produces higher surface-brightness and more centrally
peaked galaxies with increasing mass. However, the presence of high-luminosity
low-C_31 galaxies hints at other machanisms and physical properties (such as
angular momentum) playing an important role in galaxy formation. (abridged)

formation. Supermassive stars are dominated by photon pressure and radiate at

relativistic instability. Above some critical value of the metallicity, their
collapse can lead to a gigantic explosion, powered by the energy release due to
hydrogen burning, but below this critical metallicity their collapse inevitably
ends in the formation of a black hole, accompanied by the emission of huge
amounts of energy in the form of neutrinos. Although collapsing supermassive

This multiwavelength spectrum placed very strong constraints on its unusually

Eddington) rate of accretion onto a disk surrounding a low mass black hole.
However, while a simple, geometrically-thin accretion disk provides a good fit
to the UV to X-ray continuum, it leaves a residual flat and featureless
component in the optical. We propose that the disk is actually flared or warped
and that the central ionizing EUV/X-ray continuum is irradiating the outer
parts of the disk and boosting the optical/UV continuum flux. The relatively
narrow permitted lines may be due to a resulting disk wind. This physical
interpretation may explain the link between ultrasoft X-ray excesses and broad
line velocity in the AGN class as a whole. It may also have implications for
the possible relationship between ultrasoft AGN and galactic black holes.

in the optical but do not show the UV counterpart. Both of them show large
dusty disks observed almost edge-on, possibly implying that they play a role in
obscuring the nuclear emission. We have measured optical-UV spectral indices
alpha_o,UV between ~0.6 and ~7.0. BLRG have the flattest spectra and their
values of alpha_o,UV are also confined to a very narrow range. This is
consistent with radiation produced in a geometrically thin, optically thick
accretion disk. On the other hand, FR I nuclei, which are most plausibly
originated by synchrotron emission from the inner relativistic jet, show a wide
range of alpha_o,UV. There is a clear trend with orientation in that sources
observed almost edge-on or with clear signs of dust absorption have the
steepest spectra. These observations imply that in FR I obscuration can be
present, but the obscuring material is not in a ``standard'' geometrically
thick torus. The most striking difference between these absorbing structures
and the classic AGN ``tori'' resides in the lower optical depth of the FR I
obscuring material.

in the center of the vortex at a certain moment of the evolution and hence we
expect that the system will lose only a fraction of the atoms by Majorana flips
even in the absence of an optical plug. Our conjecture is justified by
numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, where the full spinor
degrees of freedom of the order parameter are properly taken into account. A
significant simplification of the experimental realization of the scenario is

some desirable properties of logic programming systems, referred to as the
witness properties. The witness properties concern the operational consistency
of responses to queries. A generalization of Prolog with negation as failure
and cut is described, and shown not to have the witness properties. A
restriction of the system is then described, which preserves the choice and
first-solution behaviour of cut but allows the system to have the witness
properties.
  The notion of cut in the restricted system is more restricted than the Prolog
hard cut, but retains the useful first-solution behaviour of hard cut, not
retained by other proposed cuts such as the ``soft cut''. It is argued that the
restricted system achieves a good compromise between the power and utility of
the Prolog cut and the need for internal consistency in logic programming
systems. The restricted system is given an abstract semantics, which depends on
the witness properties; this semantics suggests that the restricted system has
a deeper connection to logic than simply permitting some computations which are
logical.

symmetric, isolated body made of perfect fluid is examined within the
quasi-metric framework (QMF). It is required that the gravitational field is
""metrically static"", meaning that it is static except for the effects of the
global cosmic expansion on the spatial geometry. Dynamical equations for the
gravitational field are set up and an exact solution is found for the exterior
part. Besides, equations of motion applying to inertial test particles moving
in the exterior gravitational field are set up. By construction, the
gravitational field of the system is not static with respect to the cosmic
expansion. This means that the radius of the source increases and that
distances between circular orbits of inertial test particles increase according
to the Hubble law. Moreover, it is shown that if this model of an expanding
gravitational field is taken to represent the gravitational field of the Sun
(or isolated planetary systems), this has no serious consequences for
observational aspects of planetary motion. On the contrary some observational
facts of the Earth-Moon system are naturally explained within the QMF. Finally,
the QMF predicts different secular increases for two different gravitational
coupling parameters. But such secular changes are neither present in the
Newtonian limit of the quasi-metric equations of motion nor in the Newtonian
limit of the quasi-metric field equations valid inside metrically static
sources. Thus standard interpretations of space experiments testing the secular
variation of G are explicitly theory-dependent and do not apply to the QMF.

spatial infinity. It is given in terms of the linearised version of the Cotton
tensor and symmetrised higher order derivatives, and it ensures that the
solutions of the transport equations extend analytically to the sets where
spatial infinity touches null infinity. It is later shown that this regularity
condition together with the requirement of some particular degree of tangential
smoothness ensures logarithm-free expansions of the time development of the
linearised gravitational field close to spatial and null infinities.

particle once discovered in future accelerator experiments. The correlations
can manifest themselves e.g. in distribution of acollinearity angle of X^{+-}
in decay chain H/A -> tau^+ tau^- ; tau^{+-} -> nu X^{+-}. This delicate
measurement will require however reconstruction of the Higgs boson rest-frame.
Then, questions of the combined detector-theoretical effects may be critical to
establish reliability of the method. Appropriate Monte Carlo program is
essential.
  In the present paper we extend the standard universal interface, of the
TAUOLA tau-lepton decay library, to include the complete spin effects for tau
leptons originating from the spin zero particle. As usual, the interface is
expected to work with any Monte Carlo generator providing Higgs boson
production, and subsequent decay into pair of tau leptons.

approach, replacing the simple matrix integrals by the four dimensional matrix
path integrals of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, and the Kazakov
critical points by the Argyres-Douglas critical points. In the present paper,
we study qualitatively similar toy path integrals corresponding to the two

at large n, we can study non-BPS observables and give full proofs that double
scaling limits exist and correspond to universal continuum limits. A complete
characterization of the double scaled theories is given. We find evidence for

theories. We also identify en passant some non-BPS particles that become

to present a new related integrable Neumann-like Hamiltonian flow from the view
point of inverse recursion operator and constraint method. The whole MKdV
hierarchy both positive and negative is generated by the kernel elements of
Lenard's operators pair and recursion operator. Through solving a key operator
equation, the whole MKdV hierarchy is shown to have the Lax representation. In
particular, some new integrable equation together with the Liouville equations,
the sine-Gordon equation, and the sinh-Gordon equation are derived from the
negative order MKdV hierarchy. It is very interesting that the restricted flow,
corresponding to the negative order MKdV hierarchy, is just a new kind of
Neumann-like system. This new Neumann-like system is obtained through
restricting the MKdV spectral problem onto a symplectic submanifold and is
proven to be completely integrable under the Dirac-Poisson bracket, which we
define on the symplectic submanifold. Finally, with the help of the constraint
between the Neumann-like system and the negative order MKdV hierarchy, all
equations in the hierarchy are proven to have the parametric representations of
solutions. In particular, we obtain the parametric solutions of the sine-Gordon
equation and the sinh-Gordon equation.

associated with the spectral problem and provides an approach for constructing
their algebraic structure and $r$-matrix. First we introduce the category of
NLEEs, which composes of various positive order and negative order hierarchies
of NLEEs both integrable and non-integrable. The whole category of NLEEs
possesses a generalized Lax representation. Next, we present two different Lie
algebraic structures of the Lax operator, one of them is universal in the
category,i.e. independent of the hierarchy, while the other one is nonuniversal
in the hierarchy, i.e. dependent on the underlying hierarchy. Moreover, we find
that two kinds of adjoint maps are $r$-matrices under the algebraic structures.
In particular, the Virasoro algebraic structures without central extension of
isospectral and non-isospectral Lax operators can be viewed as reductions of
our algebraic structure. Finally, we give several concrete examples to
illustrate our methods. Particularly, the Burgers category is linearized when
the generator, which generates the category, is chosen to be independent of the
potential function. Furthermore, an isospectral negative order hierarchy in the
Burger's category is solved with its general solution. Additionally, in the KdV
category we find an interesting fact: the Harry-Dym hierarchy is contained in
this category as well as the well-known Harry-Dym equation is included in a
positive order KdV hierarchy.

from transitional to well-deformed region. It is found that the g-factor ratio
of the 2^+ state in ground bands to that of gamma-bands, r=g(2^+,
gamma-vib)/g(2^+, ground), varies along an isotopic chain. With the
gamma-deformations, which best reproduce the energy levels for both bands, we
obtain a qualitative agreement with the experimental data. This result thus
suggests that study of the ratio may provide an important information on the
triaxial deformation of a nuclear system. The angular-momentum dependence of
the ground band g-factor on the triaxial deformation is also investigated.

  Optical and Quantum Electronics",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Lasers essentially consist of single-mode optical cavities containing
two-level atoms with a supply of energy called the pump and a sink of energy,
perhaps an optical detector. The latter converts the light energy into a
sequence of electrical pulses corresponding to photo-detection events. It was
predicted in 1984 on the basis of Quantum Optics and verified experimentally
shortly thereafter that when the pump is non-fluctuating the emitted light does
not fluctuate much. Precisely, this means that the variance of the number of
photo-detection events observed over a sufficiently long period of time is much
smaller than the average number of events. Light having that property is said
to be ``sub-Poissonian''. The theory presented rests on the concept introduced
by Einstein around 1905, asserting that matter may exchange energy with a wave
at angular frequency $\omega$ only by multiples of $\hbar\omega$. The optical
field energy may only vary by integral multiples of $\hbar\omega$ as a result
of matter quantization and conservation of energy. A number of important
results relating to isolated optical cavities containing two-level atoms are
first established on the basis of the laws of Statistical Mechanics. Next, the
laser system with a pump and an absorber of radiation is treated. The
expression of the photo-current spectral density found in that manner coincides
with the Quantum Optics result. The concepts employed in this paper are
intuitive and the algebra is elementary. The paper supplements a previous OQE

few-photon pulse on a single atom. The photon wave packet is assumed to
propagate in a transversely strongly confined geometry, which ensures strong
atom-light coupling and allows a quasi 1D treatment. The amplitude and phase of
the transmitted, reflected and transversely scattered part of the wave packet
strongly depend on the pulse length (bandwidth) and energy. For a transverse
mode size of the order of $\lambda^2$, we find nonlinear behavior for a few
photons already, or even for a single photon. In a second step we study the
collision of two such wave packets at the atomic site and find striking
differences between Fock state and coherent state wave packets of the same
photon number.

are known to give rise to a long-range attractive force between metal plates
(Casimir effect). For ferromagnetic layers separated by vacuum, it is shown
that the interplay of the Casimir effect and of the magneto-optical Kerr effect
gives rise to a long-range magnetic interaction. The Casimir magnetic force is
found to decay as $D^{-1}$ in the limit of short distances, and as $D^{-5}$ in
the limit of long distances. Explicit expressions for realistic systems are
given in the large and small distance limits. An experimental test of the
Casimir magnetic interaction is proposed.

correcting codes, based on graphs, has been presented. These graph codes are
directly related to cluster states which have been introduced by Briegel and
Raussendorf. We show that the preparation of a cluster state as well as the
coding operation for a graph code, can be implemented by a logical network.
Concerning the qubit case each vertex corresponds to an Hadamard gate and each
edge corresponds to a controlled not gate.

\cite{Svetlichny} is discussed. Svetlichny's inequality which can distinguish
between genuine three-particle non-locality and two-particle non-locality is
analyzed by reinterpreting it as a frustrated network of correlations. Its
quantum mechanical maximum violation is derived and a situation is presented
that produces the maximum violation. It is shown that the measurements
performed in recent experiments to demonstrate GHZ entanglement
\cite{Bouwmeester}, \cite{Pan} do not allow this inequality to be violated, and
hence can not be taken as confirmation of genuine three-particle non-locality.
Modifications to the experiments that would make such a confirmation possible
are discussed.

the periodicity of a given periodic function has been exhibited by using
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. Two separate sets of experiments
were performed. In a full QFT, the periodicity were validated with state
tomography and fidelity measurements. For a simplified QFT, the three-qubit
pseudo-pure state was created by introducting an additional observer spin, and
the spectra recorded on the observer spin showed intuitively the power of QFT\
to find the periodicity. Experimentally realizing the QFT provides a critical
step to implement the renowned Shor's quantum factoring algorithm and many
other algorithms. Moveover, it can be applied to the study of quantum chaos and
other quantum information processing.
