low-luminosity object transits in the Galactic disk stars commencing the third
phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment -- OGLE-III. Photometric
observations of three fields in the direction of the Galactic center (800
epochs per field) were collected on 32 nights during time interval of 45 days.
Out of the total of 5 million stars monitored, about 52~000 Galactic disk stars
with photometry better than 1.5% were analyzed for flat-bottomed eclipses with
the depth smaller than 0.08 mag.
  Altogether 46 stars with transiting low-luminosity objects were detected. For
42 of them multiple transits were observed, a total of 185, allowing orbital
period determination. Transits in two objects: OGLE-TR-40 and OGLE-TR-10, with
the radii ratio of about 0.14 and estimate of the radius of the companion
1.0-1.5R_Jup, resemble the well known planetary transit in HD 209458. The
sample was selected by the presence of apparent transits only, with no
knowledge on any other properties. Hence, it is very well suited for general
study of low-luminosity objects. The transiting objects may be Jupiters, brown
dwarfs, or M dwarfs. Future determination of the amplitude of radial velocity
changes will establish their masses, and will confirm or refute the reality of
the so called ``brown dwarf desert''. The low-mass stellar companions will
provide new data needed for the poorly known mass-radius relation for the lower
main sequence. All photometric data are available to the astronomical community
from the OGLE Internet archive.

emission from highly relativistic electrons. We find, in agreement with Sazonov
(1970), that strong effects are possible also in the absence of a
non-relativistic plasma component, due to the relativistic electrons (and
protons) themselves. In contrast with Sazonov, who infers strong effects only
in cases where the ratio of plasma frequency to cyclotron frequency is much
larger than the square of the characteristic electron Lorentz factor, nu_p/nu_B
>> gamma^2, we find strong effects also for 1 << nu_p/nu_B << gamma^2. The
modification of the spectrum is prominent at frequencies nu < nu_{R*} = nu_p
min[gamma, (nu_p/nu_B)^(1/2)], where nu_{R*} generalizes the Razin-Tsytovich
frequency, nu_R = gamma nu_p, to the regime nu_p/nu_B << gamma^2. Applying our
results to gamma-ray burst (GRB) plasmas, we predict a strong modification of
the radio spectrum on minute time scale following the GRB, at the onset of
fireball interaction with its surrounding medium, in cases where the ratio of
the energy carried by the relativistic electrons to the energy carried by the
magnetic field exceeds ~ 10^5. Plausible electron distribution functions may
lead to negative synchrotron reabsorption, i.e to coherent radio emission,
which is characterized by a low degree of circular polarization. Detection of
these effects would constrain the fraction of energy in the magnetic field,
which is currently poorly determined by observations, and, moreover, would
provide a novel handle on the properties of the environment into which the
fireball expands.

surface brightness profile of the lens galaxy D in the system MG2016+112

mass distribution. We find that: (i) dark matter accounts for >50% of the total
mass within the Einstein radius (99% CL), excluding at the 8-sigma level that
mass follows light inside the Einstein radius with a constant mass-to-light
ratio (M/L). (ii) the total mass distribution inside the Einstein radius is
well-described by a density profile ~r^-gamma' with an effective slope
gamma'=2.0+-0.1+-0.1, including random and systematic uncertainties. (iii) The
offset of galaxy D from the local Fundamental Plane independently constrains
the stellar M/L, and matches the range derived from our models, leading to a
more stringent lower limit of >60% on the fraction of dark matter within the
Einstein radius (99%CL).
  Under the assumption of adiabatic contraction, the inner slope of the dark
matter halo before the baryons collapsed is gamma_i<1.4 (68 CL), marginally
consistent with the highest-resolution cold dark matter simulations that
indicate gamma_i~1.5. This might indicate that either adiabatic contraction is
a poor description of E/S0 formation or that additional processes play a role
as well. Indeed, the apparently isothermal density distribution inside the
Einstein radius, is not a natural outcome of adiabatic contraction models,
where it appears to be a mere coincidence. By contrast, we argue that
isothermality might be the result of a stronger coupling between luminous and
dark-matter, possibly the result of (incomplete) violent relaxation processes.
Hence, we conclude that galaxy D appears already relaxed 8 Gyr ago.

weakening of relativistic reverse shocks by mass loading in PWNs is responsible
for the low radiative efficiencies of the majority of the PWNs. Mass loading
may also result in a shock transition near the fast magnetosonic point; this is
unlikely to happen in majority of PWNs. The evolution of magnetized mass loaded
flows beyond the reverse shock is complicated: after initial deceleration to
the minimal velocity required to transport the magnetic flux, the mass loaded
flows have to {\it accelerate}. In order to be able to expand to infinity,
magnetized flows should either become time dependent or destroy the toroidal
magnetic flux by developing internal instabilities. Destruction of the magnetic
flux initiated by mass loading may allow for the flow to slow down to
sub-relativistic velocities and resolve the $\sigma$ paradox of the pulsar wind
nebula.

the (induced) brane metric contributes to the brane action. The scalar
curvature term arises generically on account of one-loop effects induced by
matter fields residing on the brane. Spatially flat braneworld models can enter
into a regime of accelerated expansion at late times. This is true even if the
brane tension and the bulk cosmological constant are tuned to satisfy the
Randall--Sundrum constraint on the brane. Braneworld models admit a wider range
of possibilities for dark energy than standard LCDM. In these models the
luminosity distance can be both smaller and larger than the luminosity distance
in LCDM. Whereas models with $d_L \leq d_L(\rm LCDM)$ imply $w = p/\rho \geq
-1$ and have frequently been discussed in the literature, models with $d_L >
d_L(\rm LCDM)$ have traditionally been ignored, perhaps because within the
general-relativistic framework, the luminosity distance has this property {\em
only if} the equation of state of matter is strongly negative ($w < -1$).
Matter with $w < -1$ is beset with a host of undesirable properties, which
makes this model of dark energy unattractive within the conventional framework.
Braneworld models, on the other hand, have the capacity to endow dark energy
with exciting new possibilities without suffering from the problems faced by
models with $w < -1$. For a subclass of parameter values, braneworld dark
energy and the acceleration of the universe are {\em transient} phenomena. In
these models, the universe, after the current period of acceleration, re-enters
the matter dominated regime so that the deceleration parameter $q(t) \to 0.5$
when $t \gg t_0$, where $t_0$ is the present epoch. Such models could help
reconcile an accelerating universe with the requirements of string/M-theory.

particularly those of glassforming systems, have focused on the ""energy
landscape"" as a means of dealing with the collective variables problem [1]. The
""basins of attraction"" that constitute the landscape features in configuration
space represent a distinct class of microstates of the system. So far only the
microstates that are related to structural relaxation and viscosity have been
considered in this paradigm. But most of the complex systems of importance in
nature and industry are solutions, particularly solutions that are highly
non-ideal in character. In these, a distinct class of fluctuations exists, the
fluctuations in concentration. The mean square amplitudes of these fluctuations
relate to the chemical activity coefficients [2], and their rise and decay
times may be much longer than those of the density fluctuations - from which
they may be statistically independent. Here we provide data on the character of
chemical order fluctuations in viscous liquids and on their relation to the
enthalpy fluctuations that determine the structural relaxation time, and hence
the glass temperature Tg. Using a spectroscopically active chemical order
probe, we identify a ""chemical fictive temperature"", Tchm, by analogy with the
familiar ""fictive temperature"" Tf (the cooling Tg). Like Tf, Tchm must be the
same as the real temperature for the system to be in complete equilibrium. It
is possible for mobile multicomponent liquids to be permanently nonergodic,
insofar as Tchm > Tf = T, which must be accommodated within the landscape
paradigm. We note that, in appropriate systems, an increase in concentration of
slow chemically ordering units in liquids can produce a crossover to fast ion
conducting glass phenomenology.

algorithms that can be constructed only for a limited range of Hamiltonians
(where back-tracking can be avoided). The ""algorithmic discontinuities"" between
general and special points (or regions) in parameter space can hence be
eliminated. As a specific example, we consider the anisotropic S=1/2 Heisenberg
antiferromagnet in an external magnetic field. We show that directed loop
simulations are very efficient for the full range of magnetic fields (zero to
the saturation point) and anisotropies. In particular for weak fields and
anisotropies, the autocorrelations are significantly reduced relative to those
of previous approaches. The back-tracking probability vanishes continuously as
the isotropic Heisenberg point is approached. For the XY-model, we show that
back-tracking can be avoided for all fields extending up to the saturation
field. The method is hence particularly efficient in this case. We use directed
loop simulations to study the magnetization process in the 2D Heisenberg model
at very low temperatures. For LxL lattices with L up to 64, we utilize the
step-structure in the magnetization curve to extract gaps between different
spin sectors. Finite-size scaling of the gaps gives an accurate estimate of the

the quasiparticle spectrum in a magnetic field, where the imperfect nesting
plays the crucial role. We propose that below T* ~ 4K the new unconventional
SDW (USDW) appears modifying dramatically the quasiparticle spectrum. Unlike
conventional SDW the order parameter of USDW depends on the quasiparticle

models in the presence of a Gauss-Bonnet term. We analyze two string gravity
models-- dilaton-driven and modulus-driven cases-- in the Bianchi type-I
background without an axion field. In both scenarios singularities can be
classified in two ways- the determinant singularity where the main determinant
of the system vanishes and the ordinary singularity where at least one of the
anisotropic expansion rates of the Universe diverges. In the dilaton case,
either of these singularities inevitably appears during the evolution of the
system. In the modulus case, nonsingular cosmological solutions exist both in
asymptotic past and future with determinant $D=+\infty$ and D=2, respectively.
In both scenarios nonsingular trajectories in either future or past typically
meet the determinant singularity in past/future when the solutions are
singular, apart from the exceptional case where the sign of the time-derivative
of dilaton is negative. This implies that the determinant singularity may play
a crucial role to lead to singular solutions in an anisotropic background.

small. We then argue that the total probability of creating a horizon given by

  and Infinite Dimensional Analysis, Cottbus, March 15-20, 2001",,,,"math.FA math.PR",,"  Stationary quantum stochastic process j is introduced as a *-homomorphism
embedding an involutive graded algebra $\tilde K=\oplus_{i=1}^{\infty}K_i$ into
a ring of (abelian) cohomologies of the one-parameter group $\alpha$ consisting
of *-automorphisms of certain operator algebra in a Hilbert space such that
every x from $K_i$ is translated into an additive $i-\alpha$-cocycle j(x). It
is shown that (noncommutative) multiplicative markovian cocycle defines a
perturbation of the stationary quantum stochastic process in the sense of such
definition. The $E_0$-semigroup $\tilde \beta$ on the von Neumann algebra $\cal
N$ associated with the markovian perturbation of K-flow j posseses the
restriction $\tilde \beta |_{{\cal N}_0}, {\cal N}_0\subset {\cal N}$, which is
conjugate to the flow of Powers shifts $\beta$ associated with j. It yields for
$\tilde \beta$ an analogue of the Wold decomposition for classical stochastic
process on completely nondeterministic and deterministic parts. The examples of
quantum stationary stochastic processes on the algebras of canonical
commutation, anticommutation and square of white noise relations are
considered. In the model situation of the space $L^2(\mathbb R)$ all markovian
cocycles of the group of shifts are described up to unitary equivalence of
perturbations.

in the case of zero temperature, the angular momentum components larger than

potential at finite momentum. It is found that the particular treatment of the
medium effects has a strong influence on the behavior of the antikaon potential
with temperature. Our self-consistent model, in which antikaons and pions are
dressed in the medium, gives a moderately temperature dependent antikaon
potential which remains attractive at GSI temperatures, contrary to what one

nonlinear crystals, based on the Wigner representation of the radiation field.
Taking advantage of the fact that the Wigner function is always positive in
parametric down conversion experiments, we construct a local hidden variables
model where the amplitudes of the field modes are taken as random variables
whose probability distribution is the Wigner function. In order to achieve our
goal we give a model of detection which is fully local but departs from quantum
theory. In our model the zeropoint (vacuum) level of radiation lies below a
threshold of the detectors and only signals above the threshold are detectable.
The predictions of the model agree with those of quantum mechanics if the
signal intensities surpase some level and the efficiency is low. This is
consistent with the known fact that quantum mechanics is compatible with local
realism in that case (a fact called the ``efficiency loophole''). Our model
gives a number of constraints which do not follow from the quantum theory of
detection and are experimentally testable.
