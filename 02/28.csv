the properties of the diffuse ionized gas (DIG), in particular, the origin of
the observed spatial variations in the line intensity ratios. We have derived
electron temperatures, ionization fractions and abundances along the slit. Our
data include both slit positions parallel and perpendicular to the galactic
disks. This allowed us to examine variations in the line intensity ratios with
height above the midplane as well as distance from the galactic centers. The
observed increase in the [OII]/Halpha line ratio towards the halo seems to
require an increase in electron temperature caused by a non-ionizing heating
mechanism. We conclude that gradients in the electron temperature can play a
significant role in the observed variations in the optical emission line ratios
from extraplanar DIG.

of the inner radio lobes and intermediate radio ridges, respectively. We
speculate that these discontinuities may be spherical pulses or ""fronts"" driven

are found in recent numerical simulations. All these results provide good
evidence that the nuclear activity affects the intra-cluster medium. We present
a temperature map of the intra-cluster medium, and obtain the temperature,
pressure and cooling time as a function of nuclear distance for the arcs and
the ambient intra-cluster medium. We show that the gas in the arcs is cooler
than, and probably over-pressured with respect to, the ambient intra-cluster
medium. The metal abundances of the cooler gas in the arc are somewhat enhanced
relative to the ambient intra-cluster medium, favoring a ``buoyant plume''
origin for the X-ray arc, in which ambient gas near the nucleus is entrained by
buoyant radio plasma and carried to larger nuclear distances. (Abstract

High densities result in optically thick lines for which line strengths are
only dependent on the emitting surface. Low density gas produces optically thin

recombination lines, while disks are dominated by optically thick lines. Disks

in those objects with detected Fe lines, a skewed broad component, typically

observations of SN 1986J, 16 yr after its explosion. We obtained a

the shell is $\sim4.7 {\rm mas}$, corresponding to a linear size of $\sim6.8
\times 10^{17} {\rm cm}$ for a distance of 9.6 Mpc to NGC 891. The average
speed of the shell has decreased from $\sim$7400 \kms in 1988.74 down to about
$6300 {\rm km s^{-1}}$ in 1999.14, indicative of a mild deceleration in the
expansion of SN 1986J. Assuming a standard density profile for the progenitor
wind ($\rho_{\rm cs} \propto r^{-s}, s=2$), the swept-up mass by the shock
front is $\sim$2.2\Ms. This large swept-up mass, coupled with the mild
deceleration suffered by the supernova, suggests that the mass of the
hydrogen-rich envelope ejected at explosion was $\ga12$ \Ms. Thus, the
supernova progenitor must have kept intact most of its hydrogen-rich envelope
by the time of explosion, which favours a single, massive star progenitor
scenario. We find a flux density for SN 1986J of $\sim$7.2 mJy at the observing
frequency of 5 GHz, which results in a radio luminosity of $\sim1.4 \times
10^{37} {\rm erg s^{-1}}$ for the frequency range $10^7$--$10^{10}$ Hz ($\alpha
=-0.69; S_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha})$. We detect four bright knots that
delineate the shell structure, and an absolute minimum of emission, which we
tentatively identify with the centre of the supernova explosion. If this is the
case, SN 1986J has then suffered an asymmetric expansion. We suggest that this
asymmetry is due to the collision of the supernova ejecta with an anisotropic,
clumpy (or filamentary) medium.

spectral index alpha_L = 2.37 +- 0.21. In the same multipole range the angular
power spectra of the E and B components of the polarised signal are
significantly flatter, with fitted spectral indices respectively of alpha_E =
1.57 +- 0.12 and alpha_B = 1.45 +- 0.12. Temperature fluctuations in the E and
B components are mostly determined by variations in polarisation angle. We have
combined these results with other data from available radio surveys in order to
produce a full-sky toy model of Galactic synchrotron intensity and linear
polarisation at high frequencies (> 10 GHz). This can be used to study the
feasibility of measuring the Cosmic Microwave Background polarisation with

R ~ 26.7 mag/arcsec^2 (at more than 3-sigma level), so there is no direct
evidence up to this limiting magnitude of a relation between the peculiar
kinematical structure found in NGC 7331 and an ongoing or past interaction
between this galaxy and NGC 7320. The Halpha emission at high-velocity
(6000-7000 km/s) is distributed in a diffuse structure running NS between NGC
7319 and NGC 7318B and in some other more concentrated features. Some of these
are located in the tidal tails produced by the interaction between the galaxies
of the group. With the Halpha images we have made a two-dimensional velocity
map which helps to identify the origin of each structure detected. This map
does not show features at intermediate velocities between the high- and
low-redshift members of the group. This is in agreement with the standard
scenario in which the apparent proximity of NGC 7320 to the rest of the
galaxies of the Quintet is merely a projection effect. The only point which is
unclear in this interpretation, is an Halpha filament which is seen extending
throughout NGC 7320 with velocity at 6500 km/s instead of the 800 km/s expected

junctions slip with respect to their positions in the bulk medium with various
rates). The distribution of activation energies for sliding in active

adatom mobility, or increase the adatom chemical potential. In particular,
impurities acting as random barriers (without affecting the adatom binding)
cause step bunching, while for impurities acting as random traps the
combination of the two effects reduces to a modification of the attachment
boundary conditions at the steps. In this case attachment to descending steps,
and thus step bunching, is favored if the impurities bind adatoms more weakly

interactions (nu_a nu_b * ff) with strength eps_ab*G_F, where (a,b) are flavor
indices. We revisit their effects on flavor oscillations of massive
(anti)neutrinos in supernovae, in order to achieve, in the region above the
protoneutron star, an analytical treatment valid for generic values of the
neutrino mixing angles (omega,phi,psi)=(theta_12,theta_13,theta_23). Assuming
that eps_ab<<1, we find that the leading effects on the flavor transitions
occurring at high (H) and low (L) density along the supernova matter profile
can be simply embedded through the replacements phi-->phi+eps_H and
omega-->omega+eps_L, respectively, where eps_H and eps_L are specific linear
combinations of the eps_ab's. Similar replacements hold for eventual
oscillations in the Earth matter. From a phenomenological point of view, the
most relevant consequence is a possible uncontrolled bias (phi-->phi+eps_H) in
the value of the mixing angle phi inferred by inversion of supernova neutrino
data. Such a drawback, however, does not preclude the discrimination of the
neutrino mass spectrum hierarchy (direct or inverse) through supernova neutrino
oscillations.

$F_{\alpha\beta}, \bar{F}_{\dot\alpha\dot\beta}$, an auxiliary bispinor field
$V_{\alpha\beta}, \bar{V}_{\dot\alpha\dot\beta}$ is introduced. The gauge field
strength appears only in bilinear terms of the full Lagrangian, while the
interaction Lagrangian $E$ depends on the auxiliary fields, $E = E(V^2, \bar
V^2)$. The generic nonlinear Lagrangian depending on $F,\bar{F}$ emerges as a
result of eliminating the auxiliary fields. Two types of self-duality inherent
in the nonlinear electrodynamics models admit a simple characterization in
terms of the function $E$. The continuous SO(2) duality symmetry between
nonlinear equations of motion and Bianchi identities amounts to requiring $E$
to be a function of the SO(2) invariant quartic combination $V^2\bar V^2$,
which explicitly solves the well-known self-duality condition for nonlinear
Lagrangians. The discrete self-duality (or self-duality under Legendre
transformation) amounts to a weaker condition $E(V^2, \bar{V}^2) = E(-V^2,
-\bar{V}^2)$. We show how to generalize this approach to a system of $n$

Lagrangian should be U(n) invariant function of $n$ bispinor auxiliary fields.

There is an abundance of numerical work on them, and their stochastic structure

structure of these problems is largely unstudied. Our philosophy now is that
such valuation problems should be considered as an extension of the theory of
special functions: they lead to new problems about new classes of special
functions which should be studied in terms of and using of the methods of
special functions and their theory. This is exemplified by deriving integral
representations for the Black-Scholes prices based on Yor's Laplace transform
ansatz to their valuation. They are obtained by analytic Laplace inversion
using complex analytic methods. The analysis ultimately rests on the gamma
function which in this sense is found to be at the base of Asian options. The
results improve on those of Yor and have served us a as starting point for
deriving first time benchmark prices for these options.

statistical multifragmentation model (SMM). A single set of SMM parameters
directly determined by the data and the semi-empiricalmass formula are used
after the adjustable inverse level density parameter, $\epsilon_{o}$ is
determined by the fragment distributions. The results from SMM for second stage
multiplicity, size of the biggest fragment and the intermediate mass fragments
are in excellent agreement with the data. Multifragmentation thresholds have
been obtained for all three systems using SMM prior to secondary decay. The
data indicate that both thermal excitation energy $E_{th}^{*}$ and the isotope
ratio temperature $T_{He-DT}$ decrease with increase in system size at the
critical point. The breakup temperature obtained from SMM also shows the same
trend as seen in the data. The SMM model is used to study the nature of the MF
phase transition. The caloric curve for Kr exhibits back-bending (finite latent
heat) while the caloric curves for Au and La are consistent with a continuous
phase transition (nearly zero latent heat) and the values of the critical
exponents $\tau$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, both from data and SMM, are close to
those for a 'liquid-gas' system for Au and La. We conclude that the larger
Coulomb expansion energy in Au and La reduces the latent heat required for MF
and changes the nature of the phase transition. Thus the Coulomb energy plays a
major role in nuclear MF.

bending. This is a pure phenomenological observation which is found for several
DNA sequences with a few exception. Therefore, this length scale has been used
as an approximate measure to exclude the bending regions from the slope
analyses. The asymmetries in the nucleotide contents or the patchy structure as
a possible origin of the long range correlations has also been investigated.

transverse pattern formation instability in intra-cavity second-harmonic
generation. The Q representation of a quasi-probability distribution is
implemented in terms of nonlinear stochastic Langevin equations. We study these
equations through extensive numerical simulations and analytically in the
linearized limit. Our study, made below and above the threshold of pattern
formation, is guided by a microscopic scheme of photon interaction underlying
pattern formation in second-harmonic generation. Close to the threshold for
pattern formation, beams with opposite direction of the off-axis critical wave
numbers are shown to be highly correlated. This is observed for the fundamental
field, for the second harmonic field and also for the cross-correlation between
the two fields. Nonlinear correlations involving the homogeneous transverse
wave number, which are not identified in a linearized analysis, are also
described. The intensity differences between opposite points of the far fields
are shown to exhibit sub-Poissonian statistics, revealing the quantum nature of
the correlations. We observe twin beam correlations in both the fundamental and
second-harmonic fields, and also nonclassical correlations between them.

  in detail elsewhere. Submitted to J. Phys. A",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We study a simplified Heisenberg spin model in order to clarify the idea of
decoherence in closed quantum systems. For this purpose, we define a new
concept: the decoherence function \Xi(t), which describes the dynamics of
decoherence in the whole system, and which is linked with the total (von
Neumann) entropy of all particles. As expected, decoherence is understood both
as a statistical process that is caused by the dynamics of the system, and also
as a matter of entropy. Moreover, the concept of decoherence time is applicable
in closed systems and we have solved its behaviour in the Heisenberg model with
respect to particle number N, density \rho and spatial dimension D in a 1/r
-type of potential. We have also studied the Poincare recurrences occurring in
these types of systems: in an N=1000 particle system the recurrence time is
close to the order of the age of the universe. This encourages us to conclude
that decoherence is the solution for quantum-classical problems not only in
practice, but also in principle.

$\ket f^{\otimes N}$, $\ket{g_1}^{\otimes K}$, and $\ket{g_2}^{\otimes K}$, and
we want to decide which \textit{template} state $\ket{g_1}$ or $\ket{g_2}$,
each representing the feature of the pattern class ${\cal C}_1$ or ${\cal
C}_2$, respectively, is closest to the input \textit{feature} state $\ket f$.
This is an extension of the pattern matching problem into the quantum domain.
Assuming that these states are known a priori to belong to a certain parametric
family of pure qubit systems, we derive two kinds of matching strategies. The
first is a semiclassical strategy which is obtained by the natural extension of
conventional matching strategies and consists of a two-stage procedure:
identification (estimation) of the unknown template states to design the
classifier (\textit{learning} process to train the classifier) and
classification of the input system into the appropriate pattern class based on
the estimated results. The other is a fully quantum strategy without any
intermediate measurement which we might call as the {\it universal quantum
matching machine}. We present the Bayes optimal solutions for both strategies
in the case of K=1, showing that there certainly exists a fully quantum
matching procedure which is strictly superior to the straightforward
semiclassical extension of the conventional matching strategy based on the
learning process.

theorem. The system is forced to evolve in a set of orthogonal subspaces of the
total Hilbert space and a dynamical superselection rule arises. The dynamical
properties of this evolution are investigated and several examples are
