of the neutral interstellar gas, and, as a consequence, it determines whether
the thermal balance of the neutral gas results in cold ($T\sim 50 - 100 K$)
clouds (CNM), warm ($T \sim 10^4 K$) clouds (WNM), or a combination of the two.
High FUV fields convert the neutral gas to WNM, while low fields result in CNM.
The sources of FUV radiation are the short-lived massive stars that generally
originate in associations that form in Giant Molecular Clouds present in the
galactic disk. Using McKee & Williams' (1997) distribution of birthrates for OB
associations in the Galaxy, we determine the expected behavior of the
time-dependent FUV field for random positions in the local ISM. The FUV field
is calculated in two bands (912-1100 \AA and 912-2070 \AA) and at the
wavelength 1400 \AA. Our median value for the [912-2070 \AA] band is $G_0=1.6$
times Habing's (1968) value for the radiation field at the solar circle in this
band, and quite close to Draine's (1976) value, $G_0=1.7$. Due to attenuation
by dust, only associations within about 500 pc contribute significantly to the
energy density at a given point. The FUV field is asymmetric at a given point,
and the asymmetry grows for higher fields. The FUV field fluctuates with a
variety of amplitudes, the larger ones being less frequent. The mean field is
about twice the median field because of these fluctuations, or spikes, in the
radiation field. These spikes, which last $\sim 30$ Myr, are caused by the
infrequent birth of nearby associations. We also model shorter duration spikes
caused by runaway OB stars. The presence of a fluctuating heating rate created
by the fluctuating FUV field converts CNM to WNM and vice versa.

solely on the analysis of SN spectra to determine their type. However,
spectroscopy may not be possible or practical when SNe are faint, numerous, or
discovered in archival studies. We present a classification method for SNe
based on the comparison of their observed colors with synthetic ones,
calculated from a large database of multi-epoch optical spectra of nearby
events. We discuss the capabilities and limitations of this method. For
example, type Ia SNe at redshifts z < 0.1 can be distinguished from most other
SN types during the first few weeks of their evolution, based on V-R vs. R-I
colors. Type II-P SNe have distinct (very red) colors at late (t > 100 days)
stages. Broadband photometry through standard Johnson-Cousins $UBVRI$ filters
can be useful to classify SNe out to z ~ 0.6. The use of Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) ugriz filters allows the extension of our classification method
to even higher redshifts (z = 0.75), and the use of infrared bands, to z = 2.5.
We demonstrate the application of this method to a recently discovered SN from
the SDSS. Finally, we outline the observational data required to further
improve the sensitivity of the method, and discuss prospects for its use on
future SN samples. Community access to the tools developed is provided by a

model with all the three bare masses and eight cubic couplings. The critical
role n may play is also emphasized. To make perturbative calculations feasible,
a new representation of the cubic interaction is introduced. To illustrate the

with relativistic sources is studied in the static case yielding a revision of
the equivalence principle (intrinsically relativistic sources generate twice
stronger gravitational fields and hyperrelativistic sources, e.g., the stiff
matter, generate four times stronger fields than non-relativistic sources). It
is shown that analogues of electromagnetic field, strictly speaking, exist only
in even-dimensional spacetimes. In (2+1)-dimensional spacetime, the field
traditionally interpreted as ""magnetic"" turns out to be in fact a perfect
fluid, and ""electric"", a perverse fluid (this latter concept arises inevitably
in the r-form description of fluids for any D, and we consider here perverse
fluids in (3+1)-dimensional spacetime too). New exact solutions of
(2+1)-dimensional Einstein's equations with perfect and perverse fluids are
obtained, and it is shown that in this case there exists a vast family of
static solutions for non-coherent dust, in a sharp contrast to the
(3+1)-dimensional case. New general interpretation of the cosmological term in
D-dimensional Einstein's equations is given via the (D-1)-form field, and it is
shown that this field is as well responsible (as this is the case in 3+1

numbers $\Qp$ and solenoids $\Tp$ into the complex plane $\sC$ and the space
\~$\Rs ^{3}$, respectively. Accordingly, this family includes the mappings for
which the Cantor set and the Sierpinski triangle are images of the unit balls
in $\Qn{2}$ and $\Qn{3}$. In each of the families, the subset of the embeddings
is found. For these embeddings, the Hausdorff dimensions are calculated and it
is shown that the fractal measure on the image of $\Qp$ coincides with the Haar
measure on $\Qp$. It is proved that under certain conditions, the image of the
$p$-adic solenoid is an invariant set of fractional dimension for a dynamic
system. Computer drawings of some fractal images are presented.

(development of magnetic fields with large spatial scales), due to
helically-driven magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, are reported. The apparent
effect of the dc magnetic field is to suppress the dynamo action, above a
relatively low threshold. However, the possibility that the suppression results
from an improper combination of rectangular triply spatially-periodic boundary
conditions and a uniform dc magnetic field is addressed: heretofore a common
and convenient computational convention in turbulence investigations. Physical
reasons for the observed suppression are suggested. Other geometries and
boundary conditions are offered for which the dynamo action is expected not to
be suppressed by the presence of a dc magnetic field component.

the fluid's statistics can be set up as a space-time path integral. Fluid
space-time configuration sampling techniques naturally suggest a useful way,
using an arbitrary initial statistics functional, to calculate averages.
