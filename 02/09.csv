the field) of very short period, massive double-white-dwarf stars and of
giant-white dwarf binaries. These results are based on N-body simulations
performed with the new GRAPE-6 special purpose hardware and are important in
identifying and characterizing the progenitors of type Ia supernovae. The high
incidence of very close double-white-dwarf systems is the result of dynamical
encounters between (mostly) primordial binaries and other cluster stars.
Orbital hardening rapidly drives these degenerate binaries to periods under ~10
hours. Gravitational radiation emission and mergers producing
supra-Chandrasekhar objects follow in less than a Hubble time. If most stars
are born in clusters then estimates of the double white dwarf merger rates in
galaxies (due to cluster dynamical interaction) must be increased more than
tenfold. A majority of the Roche lobe overflow giant-white dwarf binaries are
not primordial; they are produced in exchange reactions. Most cases resulted in
a common-envelope and formation of a double-white-dwarf binary rather than
Supersoft X-ray sources leading possibly to a type Ia supernova.

the dark halo population and on the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD), which
specifies the way that galaxies populate the halos. SPH simulations and
semi-analytic models make similar predictions for the probability P(N|M) that a
halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies of a specified type: a non-linear
mean occupation N_avg(M), sub-Poisson fluctuations about the mean in low mass
halos, and strong dependence of N_avg(M) on stellar population age. The
complementary sensitivity of different clustering statistics should make it
possible to determine the HOD empirically given an assumed cosmological model.
Furthermore, changes to the cosmological model change the halo population in
ways that would be difficult to mask by changing the HOD. Ultimately, we can
hope to have our cake and eat it too, obtaining strong guidance to the physics
of galaxy formation by deriving the HOD of different classes of galaxies, while
simultaneously carrying out precision tests of cosmological models.

gaseous merging of the proto-galactic fragments leads to a significant
age-spread amongst the metal-rich GCs, which increases for lower-luminosity
galaxies. We find the total GC populations scale with host galaxy luminosity as
L^1.25, due to the systematic increase in the mass-to-light ratios (with mass)
of the galaxy haloes in the model. A comparison between the luminosity growth
of the model ellipticals and their GC formation indicates that mergers do not
significantly effect S_N at z < 2. We conclude that gaseous merging, the bulk
of which occurs at 1 < z < 4 in the Lambda-CDM model, leads to the formation of
the metal-rich peak of the GC systems of elliptical galaxies. We suggest that
the formation and subsequent truncation of the metal-poor GCs is closely

quasiparticles in the Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) regime. For fractional
filling factors nu=1/3 and 2/5 of the first Landau level, fractional charges
q=e/3 and e/5, respectively, were measured. We investigate here the interaction
of e/3 quasiparticles with a strong backscatterer and find unexpected results.
When a weak backscatterer is introduced in the path of an otherwise noiseless
current of quasiparticles, stochastic partitioning of the quasiparticles takes
place and shot noise proportional to their charge appears. Specifically, at
nu=1/3, noise corresponding to q=e/3 appears. However, the measured charge
increases monotonically as backscattering becomes stronger, approaching
asymptotically q=e. In other words, only electrons, or alternatively, three
bunched quasiparticles, tunnel through high potential barriers when impinged by
a noiseless current of quasiparticles. Here we show that such bunching of
quasiparticles by a strong backscatterer depends on the average occupation
(dilution) of the impinging quasiparticle current. For a very dilute impinging
current, bunching ceases altogether and the transferred charge approaches
q=e/3. These surprising results prove that a sparse beam of quasiparticles,
each with charge e/3, tunnel through high potential barriers, originally
thought to be opaque for them.

framework for the formulation of physical theories and is a promising approach
for physics beyond the standard model. The book begins with a brief review of
relativity, relativistic quantum mechanics and classical gauge theories, with
the emphasis on the basic physical concepts and the mathematical foundations.
The external field problem and Klein's paradox are discussed and then resolved
by introducing the so-called fermionic projector, a global object in space-time
which generalizes the notion of the Dirac sea. The mathematical core of the
book is to give a precise definition of the fermionic projector and to employ
methods of hyperbolic differential equations for its detailed analysis. The
fermionic projector makes it possible to formulate a new type of variational
principles in space-time. The mathematical tools for the analysis of the
corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are developed. A particular variational
principle is proposed which gives rise to an effective interaction showing many
similarities to the interactions of the standard model.
  The main chapters of the book are easily accessible for beginning graduate
students in mathematics or physics. Several appendices provide supplementary
material which will be useful to the experienced researcher.

generalization, a Banach space X is uniformly convex if and only if its
identity map I_X is. Pisier showed that uniformly convex Banach spaces have
martingale type p for some p>1. We show that this fact is in general not true
for linear operators. To remedy the situation, we introduce the new concept of
martingale subtype and show, that it is equivalent, also in the operator case,
to the existence of an equivalent uniformly convex norm on X. In the case of
identity maps it is also equivalent to having martingale type p for some p>1.
  Our main method is to use sequences of ideal norms defined on the class of
all linear operators and to study the factorization of the finite summation
operators. There is a certain analogy with the theory of Rademacher type.

to be completely integrable and possess peakon solutions by Degasperis, Holm
and Hone (DHH[2002]). The isospectral eigenvalue problem associated with the

The absence of evidence for baryonic hybrids is particularly interesting. We
propose to use better symbols for the baryon resonances which do not conflict
with the simple quark structure of QCD. We shall comment also on fine tuning
the Star System for the hadronic states. The importance of greater support for
the construction and operation of secondary beams of $\pi$, $K$, $\bar p$,

densities. The Thomas-Fermi approximation is used to describe the non-uniform
matter, which is composed of a lattice of heavy nuclei. The phase transition
from uniform matter to non-uniform matter occurs around $0.06 \rm{fm^{-3}}$,
and the free neutrons drip out of nuclei at about $2.4 \times 10^{-4}\
\rm{fm^{-3}}$. We apply the resulting EOS to investigate the neutron star
properties such as maximum mass and composition of neutron stars.

from the r-process path to the neutron drip line within the framework of the
Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) theory. By introducing the quartic
self-coupling of $\omega$ meson in the RHB theory in addition to the non-linear
scalar coupling of $\sigma$ meson, we reproduce the available data on the shell
effects about the waiting-point nucleus $^{80}$Zn. With this approach, it is
shown that the shell effects at N=82 in the inaccessible region of the
r-process path become milder as compared to the Lagrangian with the scalar
self-coupling only. However, the shell effects remain stronger as compared to
the quenching exhibited by the HFB+SkP approach. It is also shown that in
reaching out to the extreme point at the neutron drip line, a terminal
situation arises where the shell structure at the magic number is washed out
significantly.

for the understanding of multi-enzyme networks. At the core of this approach is
the flux summation theorem. This theorem implies that there is an invariant
relationship between the control coefficients of enzymes in a pathway. One of
the main conclusions that has been derived from the summation theorem is that
phenotypic robustness to mutation (e.g. dominance) is an inherent property of
metabolic systems and hence does not require an evolutionary explanation
(Kacser & Burns (1981). Genetics. 97, 639-666; Porteous (1996). J. theor. Biol.
182, 223-232). Here we show that for mutations involving discrete changes (of
any magnitude) in enzyme concentration the flux summation theorem does not
hold. The scenarios we examine are two-enzyme pathways with a diffusion
barrier, two enzyme pathways that allow for enzyme saturation and two enzyme
pathways that have both saturable enzymes and a diffusion barrier. Our results
are extendable to sequential pathways with any number of enzymes. The fact that
the flux summation theorem cannot hold in sequential pathways casts serious
doubts on the claim that robustness with respect to mutations is an inherent
property of metabolic systems.
