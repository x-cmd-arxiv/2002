dwarfs should have relic planetary systems. While planets closer than $\sim$
5~AU will most likely not survive the post-main sequence lifetime of its parent
star, any planet with semimajor axis $>$ 5~AU will survive, and its semimajor
axis will increase as the central star loses mass. Since the stability of
adjacent orbits to mutual planet-planet perturbations depends on the ratio of
the planet mass to the central star's mass, some planets in previously stable
orbits around a star undergoing mass loss will become unstable. We show that
when mass loss is slow, systems of two planets that are marginally stable can
become unstable to close encounters, while for three planets the timescale for
close approaches decreases significantly with increasing mass ratio. These
processes could explain the presence of anomalous IR excesses around white
dwarfs that cannot be explained by close companions, such as G29-38, and may
also be an important factor in explaining the existence of DAZ white dwarfs.
The onset of instability through changing mass-ratios will also be a
significant effect for planetary embryos gaining mass in protoplanetary disks.

so-called radio mini-halos in some cooling flow clusters can be explained by
reacceleration of relativistic electrons, the necessary energetics being
supplied by the cooling flows themselves. In particular, the reacceleration due
to MHD turbulence has the correct radial dependence on the parameters to
naturally balance the radiative losses. As an application we show that the main
properties of the radio mini-halo in the Perseus cluster (brightness profile,
total radio spectrum and radial spectral steepening) can be accounted for by
the synchrotron radiation from relic relativistic electrons in the cluster,
which are efficiently reaccelerated by MHD turbulence via Fermi-like processes
due to the compression of the cluster magnetic field in the cooling flow
region. Since the presence of an observable radio mini-halo in a cooling flow
region critically depends on the combination of several physical parameters, we
suggest that the rarity of radio mini-halos found in cooling flow clusters is
due to the fact that the physical conditions of the ICM are intermediate
between those which lead to the formation of extended radio halos and those
holding in cooling flows without radio halos. The basic results of our model
remain unchanged even if the cooling flow is stopped somewhere in the innermost
region of the cluster.

have been amplified to their present values by the turbulent dynamo inductive
action in the protogalactic and galactic medium. Up to now, in calculation of
the turbulent dynamo, it has been customary to assume that there is no back
reaction of the magnetic field on the turbulence, as long as the magnetic
energy is less than the turbulent kinetic energy. This assumption leads to the
kinematic dynamo theory. However, the applicability of this theory to
protogalaxies is rather limited. The reason is that in protogalaxies the
temperature is very high, and the viscosity is dominated by magnetized ions. As
the magnetic field strength grows in time, the ion cyclotron time becomes
shorter than the ion collision time, and the plasma becomes strongly
magnetized. As a result, the ion viscosity becomes the Braginskii viscosity.
Thus, in protogalaxies the back reaction sets in much earlier, at field
strengths much lower than those which correspond to field-turbulence energy
equipartition, and the turbulent dynamo becomes what we call the magnetized
turbulent dynamo. In this paper we lay the theoretical groundwork for the
magnetized turbulent dynamo. In particular, we predict that the magnetic energy
growth rate in the magnetized dynamo theory is up to ten time larger than that
in the kinematic dynamo theory. We also briefly discuss how the Braginskii
viscosity can aid the development of the inverse cascade of magnetic energy
after the energy equipartition is reached.

evolution of disk galaxies whose star formation is truncated, and to determine
the dependence of this evolution on the previous star formation history and the
truncation epoch. Truncated spirals show red colors $\sim 1$ Gyr after
truncation, and evolve spectrally from an e(b) type, down through the e(a),
a+k, and k+a classes, to finally become a k type. The exact behavior in this
phase depends on the truncation epoch and the star formation history prior to
truncation. For example, earlier type disks show redder colors and do not show
a+k-type spectra after truncation of star formation. We also discuss a possible
evolutionary link between the k-type galaxies with spiral morphology found in
distant clusters, and present-day S0s, by investigating whether truncated
spirals reproduce the infrared color-magnitude relation of Coma galaxies. We
suggest that only less luminous, later-type disk galaxies whose star formation

disc instabilities, cold and dense material is clumped into deep sheets or
rings. Surrounding these density enhancements is hot, tenuous gas where coronal
dissipation processes occur. We expect this situation to be most relevant when
the accretion rate is close to Eddington and the disc is radiation-pressure
dominated, and so may apply to Narrow-Line Seyfert~1 (NLS1) galaxies. In this
scenario, the hard X-ray source is obscured for most observers, and so the
detected X-ray emission would be dominated by reflection off the walls of the
sheets. A simple Comptonization calculation shows that the large photon-indices
characteristic of NLS1s would be a natural outcome of two reprocessors closely
surrounding the hard X-ray source. We test this model by fitting the XMM-Newton
spectrum of the NLS1 1H 0707-495 between 0.5 and 11 keV with reflection
dominated ionized disc models. A very good fit is found with three different
reflectors each subject to the same \Gamma=2.35 power-law. An iron
overabundance is still required to fit the sharp drop in the spectrum at around
7 keV. We note that even a small corrugation of the accretion disc may result
in \Gamma > 2 and a strong reflection component in the observed spectrum.
Therefore, this model may also explain the strength and the variability
characteristics of the MCG-6-30-15 Fe K line. The idea needs to be tested with
further broadband XMM-Newton observations of NLS1s.

orbital plane of the outer object, a secular Kozai resonance, first
investigated in the context of asteroids in the Solar System, can increase the
eccentricity of the inner body significantly. We show that in a substantial
fraction of cases the eccentricity is driven to a high enough value that the
inner binary will merge by gravitational radiation, without a strong
accompanying kick. Thus the merged object remains in the cluster; depending on
the binary fraction of black holes and the inclination distribution of
newly-formed hierarchical triples, this mechanism may allow massive black holes
to accumulate through successive mergers in the cores of globular clusters. It
may also increase the likelihood that stellar-mass black holes in globular
clusters will be detectable by their gravitational radiation.

magnetoconvection in the context of stellar dynamos. The simulation domain
represents a rectangular section from the lower part of a stellar convection
zone plus the underlying stably stratified layer, with a total depth of up to
five pressure scale heights. Once convection has attained a statistically
stationary state, a magnetic field is introduced. The magnetic field is
subsequently modified by the convective motions, and the resulting pumping
effects are isolated by calculating various coefficients of the expansion of
the electromotive force, uxb, in terms of components of the mean magnetic
field. The dependence of the pumping effects on rotation, latitude and other
parameters is studied. First numerical evidence is found for the existence of
pumping effects in the horizontal directions, unless the rotation axis
coincides with the vertical axis, as is the case on the poles. Evidence is
found that the pumping effects act differently on different components of the
mean magnetic field. Latitudinal pumping is mainly equatorward for toroidal
field, and can be poleward for poloidal field. Longitudinal pumping is mainly
retrograde for the radial field but prograde for the latitudinal field. The
pumping effect in the vertical direction is found to be dominated by the
diamagnetic effect, equivalent to a predominating downward advection with a
maximum speed in the turbulent case of about 10 percent of the rms convective
velocity. Where possible, an attempt is made to identify the physical origin of
the effect. Finally, some consequences of the results for stellar dynamos are
discussed.

three step process is used to obtain metal abundances for these galaxies. We
first calculate accurate nebular abundances for 12 galaxies whose spectra cover
the full optical region from [OII]3726,29 to beyond [SII]6717,31 and include
detection of [OIII]4363. Using secondary metallicity indicators R_23 and p_3,
we calculate metallicities for an additional 59 galaxies with spectra that
cover a similar wavelength range but lack [OIII]4363. The results are used to
calibrate relations between metallicity and two readily observed emission-line

total. The uncertainty in these latter abundance estimates is 0.16 dex. From
the large, homogeneously observed sample of star-forming galaxies we identify
low metallicity candidates for future study and investigate the
metallicity-luminosity relation. We find a linear metallicity-luminosity
relation of the following form: 12 + log(O/H) = 4.059 - 0.240 M_B, with an RMS

vary. It is shown that when the number of fields is conserved MOFT reduces to
the standard field theory but interaction constants undergo an additional
renormalization and acquire a dependence on spatial scales. In particular, the
renormalization of the gravitational constant leads to the deviation of the law
of gravity from the Newton's law in some range of scales $r_{\min}<r<r_{\max
}$, in which the gravitational potential shows essentially logarithmic $\sim
\ln r$ (instead of $1/r$) behavior. In this range, the renormalized value of
the gravitational constant $G$ increases and at scales $r > r_{\max}$ acquires
a new constant value $G^{\prime}\sim Gr_{\max}/r_{\min}$. From the dynamical
standpoint this looks as if every point source is surrounded with a halo of
dark matter. It is also shown that if the maximal scale $r_{\max}$ is absent,
the homogeneity of the dark matter in the Universe is consistent with a fractal

interaction, the Jahn-Teller (JT) level-splitting and spin-orbital
superexchange interactions. Near the antiferromagnetic (AFM)-to-ferromagnetic
(FM) phase boundary, A-type AFM [AFM(A)] and FM states accompanied by a certain
type of orbital ordering are lowered in energy at large JT distortion, which is
in agreement with the previous strong coupling study. With increasing the
GdFeO3-type distortion, their phase transition occurs. Through this magnetic
phase transition, the orbital state hardly changes, which induces nearly
continuous change in the spin coupling along the c-axis from negative to
positive. The resultant strong two-dimensionality in the spin coupling near the
phase boundary is attributed to the strong suppression of T_N and T_C, which is
experimentally observed. On the other hand, at small GdFeO3-type without JT
distortions, which correspond to LaTiO3, the most stable solution is not G-type
AFM [AFM(G)] but FM. Although the spin-orbit interaction has been considered to
be relevant at the small or no JT distortion of LaTiO3 in the literature, our
analysis indicates that the spin-orbit interaction is irrelevant to the AFM(G)
state in LaTiO3 and superexchange-type interaction dominates. On the basis of
further investigations on the nature of this FM state and other solutions, this
discrepancy is discussed in detail.

100) Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons to coherent spike-train inputs applied with
independent Poisson spike-train (ST) noise and Gaussian white noise. Three
interrelated issues have been investigated: (1) the difference and the
similarity between the effects of the two noises, (2) the size effect of a
neuron ensemble on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and (3) the compatibility
of a large firing variability with fairly good information transmission. (1)
The property of stochastic resonance (SR) for ST noise is shown to be rather
different from that for white noise. When SNR for sub-threshold inputs obtained
in our simulation is analyzed by the expression given by $SNR=10 {\rm log_{10}}
[(A/X^{\alpha}) {\rm exp}(-B/X)]$ where $X$ expresses the noise intensity and
$A$ and $B$ are constants, the index $\alpha$ is $\alpha=3$ for the ST noise
and $\alpha=2$ for the white noise: the former is different from the
conventional value of $\alpha=2$ realized in many non-linear systems. ST noise
works less effectively for SR than white noise. (2) The transmission fidelity
evaluated by SNR is much improved by increasing $N$, the size of ensemble
neurons. In a large-scale neuron ensemble, SNR for supra-threshold inputs is
shown to be not significantly degraded by weak noises responsible to SR for
sub-threshold inputs. (3) Interspike intervals (ISIs) of output spikes for
sub-threshold inputs have a large variability ($c_{v} \siml 0.8$), which is
comparable to the data observed in cortical neurons. Despite variable firings
of individual neurons, output signals summed over an ensemble may carry
information with a fairly good SNR by the aid of SR and a pooling effect.

the optimal allocation in (multi-unit) combinatorial auctions. They remarked
that Linear Programming could provide a good upper-bound to the optimal
allocation, but they went on using lighter and less tight upper-bound
heuristics, on the ground that LP was too time-consuming to be used
repetitively to solve large combinatorial auctions. We present the results of
extensive experiments solving large (multi-unit) combinatorial auctions
generated according to distributions proposed by different researchers. Our
surprising conclusion is that Linear Programming is worth using. Investing
almost all of one's computing time in using LP to bound from above the value of
the optimal solution in order to prune aggressively pays off. We present a way
to save on the number of calls to the LP routine and experimental results
comparing different heuristics for choosing the bid to be considered next.
Those results show that the ordering based on the square root of the size of
the bids that was shown to be theoretically optimal in a previous paper by the
authors performs surprisingly better than others in practice. Choosing to deal
first with the bid with largest coefficient (typically 1) in the optimal
solution of the relaxed LP problem, is also a good choice. The gap between the
lower bound provided by greedy heuristics and the upper bound provided by LP is
typically small and pruning is therefore extensive. For most distributions,
auctions of a few hundred goods among a few thousand bids can be solved in
practice. All experiments were run on a PC under Matlab.

mechanisms - in particular, their truth revelation properties - assumes that
the optimization problems are solved precisely. In reality, these optimization
problems can usually be solved only in an approximate fashion. We investigate
the impact on such mechanisms of replacing exact solutions by approximate ones.
Specifically, we look at a particular greedy optimization method. We show that
the GVA payment scheme does not provide for a truth revealing mechanism. We
introduce another scheme that does guarantee truthfulness for a restricted
class of players. We demonstrate the latter property by identifying natural
properties for combinatorial auctions and showing that, for our restricted
class of players, they imply that truthful strategies are dominant. Those
properties have applicability beyond the specific auction studied.

on a set of natural properties of choice functions. This semantics is here
shown to be equivalent to a semantics based on comparing the relative
""importance"" of sets of models, by what amounts to a qualitative probability
measure. The consequence operations defined by the equivalent semantics are
then characterized by a weakening of Tarski's properties in which the
monotonicity requirement is replaced by three weaker conditions. Classical
propositional connectives are characterized by natural introduction-elimination
rules in a nonmonotonic setting. Even in the nonmonotonic setting, one obtains
classical propositional logic, thus showing that monotonicity is not required
to justify classical propositional connectives.

automatically satisfied in LF-quantized QCD in the LC gauge for the free
massless gauge field. In the GWS model, with the spontaneous symmetry breaking
present, we find that the 't Hooft condition accompanies the LC gauge condition
corresponding to the massive vector boson. The two transverse polarization
vectors for the massive vector boson may be chosen to be the same as found in
QCD. The non-transverse and linearly independent third polarization vector is
found to be parallel to the gauge direction. The corresponding sum over
polarizations in the Standard model, indicated by $K_{\mu\nu}(k),$ has several
simplifying properties similar to the polarization sum $D_{\mu\nu}(k)$ in QCD.
The framework is ghost-free, and the interaction Hamiltonian of electroweak
theory can be expressed in a form resembling that of covariant theory, except
for few additional instantaneous interactions which can be treated
systematically. The LF formulation also provides a transparent discussion of
the Goldstone Boson (or Electroweak) Equivalence Theorem, as the illustrations

The expected ubiquitous vacuum polarization characteristic of QFT is confined
to the lightray (longitudinal) direction, whereas operators whose localization
is transversely separated are completely free of vacuum correlations. This
unexpected ''transverse return to QM'' combined with the rather universal
nature of the strongly longitudinal correlated vacuum correlations (which turn
out to be described by rather kinematical chiral theories) leads to a d-2
dimensional area structure of the d-1 dimensional lightfront theory. An
additive transcription in terms of an appropriately defined entropy related to
the vacuum restricted to the horizon is proposed and its model independent
universality aspects which permit its interpretation as a quantum candidate for
Bekenstein's area law are discussed. The transverse tensor product foliation

technique. This regularization completely eliminates divergent expressions in
the course of calculations and gives rise to a finite expression for the energy
density in question without any subtractions. Employment of the Hertz
potentials for constructing the general solution to the Maxwell equations
results in a considerable simplification of the calculations. Transition to the
global zeta function is carried out by introducing a cutoff nearby the cusp at
the origin. Proceeding from this the heat kernel coefficients are calculated
and the high temperature asymptotics of the Helmholtz free energy and of the
torque of the Casimir forces are found. The wedge singularity gives rise to a
specific high temperature behaviour $\sim T^2$ of the quantities under
consideration. The obtained results are directly applicable to the free energy
of a scalar massless field and electromagnetic field on the background of a

the perturbative instabilities. We show that they have additional special
features which allow them to evade contradiction with the second law. We
identify one mechanism which applies for most orientifold planes in string
theory, and distinct mechanisms for the O8-plane and the AdS soliton.

metric on S with cone-type singularities. We present the following surprising
phenomenon: having found a geodesic segment (saddle connection) joining a pair
of conical points one can find with a nonzero probability another saddle
connection on S having the same direction and the same length as the initial
one. The similar phenomenon is valid for the families of parallel closed
geodesics.
  We give a complete description of all possible configurations of parallel
saddle connections (and of families of parallel closed geodesics) which might
be found on a generic flat surface S. We count the number of saddle connections
of length less than L on a generic flat surface S; we also count the number of
admissible configurations of pairs (triples,...) of saddle connections; we
count the analogous numbers of configurations of families of closed geodesics.
By the previous result of A.Eskin and H.Masur these numbers have quadratic
asymptotics with respect to L. Here we explicitly compute the constant in this
quqadratic asymptotics for a configuration of every type. The constant is found
from a Siegel--Veech formula.
  To perform this computation we elaborate the detailed description of the
principal part of the boundary of the moduli space of holomorphic 1-forms and
we find the numerical value of the normalized volume of the tubular
neighborhood of the boundary. We use this for evaluation of integrals over the
moduli space.

single large j-shell and to interact via a pairing plus quadrupole interaction.
A single-particle term that splits the shell into degenerate doublets is
included so as to accommodate the physics of a Fermi surface in the problem. We
apply the p-h DMRG method to this test problem for two $j$ values, one for
which the shell model can be solved exactly and one for which the size of the
hamiltonian is much too large for exact treatment. In the former case, the
method is able to reproduce the exact results for the ground state energy, the
energies of low-lying excited states, and other observables with extreme
precision. In the latter case, the results exhibit rapid exponential
convergence, suggesting the great promise of this new methodology even for more
realistic nuclear systems. We also compare the results of the test calculation

  principles of quantum theory",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  The model of the physical system with discrete interactions is based on the
postulates that
  (i) parameters of the physical system are defined in process of its
interaction;
  (ii) the process of interaction is discrete.
  Consequently ordering of the events in the system is not automatically
implied based on the values of time, but must be specified explicitly. This
suggests the specific logic of events as well as complex character of the
function, which describes stochastic behavior of the system, hence the
parameters of the system are defined by Hermitian operators in the Hilbert
space of functions.
  The model gives an essential way to introduce the basic notions and obtain
the results of the quantum theory, to derive the meaning of the main physical
parameters, such as momentum or electric charge. Based on the proposed
postulates, Schrodinger equation for the particle is deduced in a way similar
to inferring of Smoluchowski equation in the classical statistical mechanics.
  Similarly, the equations of motion of linear fields are established by
considering Smoluchowski-type equations for amplitudes of harmonics.
  The concept of discrete interaction gives a way to de-couple the object of
experiment and a testing device (the traditional source of controversy in
quantum theory), though at expense of limitation of the principle of locality.

applied to description of motion of the relativistic particle. Applying the
concept of non-local behavior both to position in space and to time, the
apparently covariant equation of motion of the particle (Klein-Gordon) is
defined. Based on the assumption that the form of the equation has to be
invariant in inertial reference frames, the principle of constancy of the speed
of light can be deduced. Consequently the basic statements of special
relativity can be established in relation to the principles of discrete
interaction.
  The condition that Klein-Gordon equation was established without explicit use
of the principle of correspondence gives a way to specify the area of
applicability of the statement about the speed of light as the maximal speed of
propagation of information. This would permit interpretation of superluminal
phenomena with no contradictions to special relativity.
  The conventional interpretation of time as a category which specifies
succession and coexistence of events leads to interpreting of the Klein-Gordon
and related equations (such as Maxwell or Dirac) as equations of the fields.
This would justify the procedure of second quantization, so that the states of
the field are identified with the sets of particles.

distribution from the perspective of Bohmian mechanics. A detection probability
for detectors sensitive to quite arbitrary spacetime domains is formulated.
Basic positivity and monotonicity properties are established. We show that our
detection probability improves and generalises earlier proposals by Leavens and
McKinnon. The difference between the two notions is illustrated through
application to a free wave packet.

from measurements of unknown states. The construction of the optimal
discrimination device and estimation of unknown states is performed
simultaneously. A communication through a noisy quantum channel is formulated
in terms of the proposed discrimination protocol.

stochastic gravitational waves. We evaluate the `direct' gravitational effect
registered by the phase of the matter waves as well as the `indirect' effect
registered by the light waves used as beam-splitters and mirrors for the matter
waves. Considering as an example the space project HYPER, we show that both
effects are negligible for the presently studied interferometers.
