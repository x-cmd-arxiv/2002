that even quite fast jets (gamma~10) can be significantly influenced by
impinging on an oblique density gradient, exhibiting a rotation of the Mach
disk in the jet's head. The flow is bent via a potentially strong, oblique
internal shock that arises due to asymmetric perturbation of the flow by its
cocoon. In extreme cases this cocoon can form a marginally relativistic flow
orthogonal to the jet, leading to large scale dynamics quite unlike that
normally associated with astrophysical jets. Exploration of a gamma=5 flow
subject to a large amplitude precession (semi-angle 11.25dg) shows that it
retains its integrity, with modest reduction in Lorentz factor and momentum
flux, for almost 50 jet-radii, but thereafter, the collimated flow is
disrupted. The flow is approximately ballistic, with velocity vectors not
aligned with the local jet `wall'. We consider simple estimators of the flow
emissivity in each case and conclude that a) while the oblique internal shocks
which mediate a small change in the direction of the deflected flows have
little impact on the global dynamics, significantly enhanced flow emission (by
a factor of 2-3) may be associated with such regions; and b) the convolution of
rest frame emissivity and Doppler boost in the case of the precessed jet
invariably leads to a core-jet-like structure, but that intensity fluctuations
in the jet cannot be uniquely associated with either change in internal
conditions or Doppler boost alone, but in general are a combination of both
factors.

is estimated by assuming a narrow luminosity function and a model-derived
bolometric correction. The characteristic AGB star luminosity, L_AGB, is
determined from the condition that the highest number density must coincide
with the Galactic bulge. Assuming a bulge distance of 8 kpc, we determine L_AGB
\~ 3,500 Lo, in close agreement with values obtained for nearby AGB stars using
the HIPPARCOS data. We find that there are no statistically significant
differences in the Galactic distribution of AGB stars with different IRAS
colors, implying a universal density distribution. The direct determination of
this distribution shows that it is separable in the radial, R, and vertical, z,
directions. Perpendicular to the Galactic plane, the number density of AGB
stars is well described by an exponential function with a vertical scale height
of 300 pc. In the radial direction the number density of AGB stars is constant
up to R ~ 5 kpc, and then it decreases exponentially with a scale length of
\~1.6 kpc. This fall-off extends to at least 12 kpc, where the sample becomes
too small. The overall normalization implies that there are about 200,000 AGB
stars in the Galaxy. We estimate the [25]-[12] color distribution of AGB stars
for an unbiased volume-limited sample. By using a model-dependent
transformation between the color and mass-loss rate, Mdot, we constrain the
time dependence of Mdot. The results suggest that for 10^-6 Mo/yr < Mdot <
10^-5 Mo/yr the mass-loss rate increases exponentially with time. We find only
marginal evidence that the mass-loss rate increases with stellar mass.

fraction of quasars with broad-band optical colors indistinguishable from those
of stars. The distribution of quasars in the radio flux -- optical flux plane
supports the existence of the ""quasar radio-dichotomy""; 8% of all quasars with
i<18.5 are radio-loud and this fraction seems independent of redshift and
optical luminosity. The radio-loud quasars have a redder median color by 0.08
mag, and a 3 times larger fraction of objects with red colors. FIRST galaxies
represent 5% of all SDSS galaxies with r<17.5, and 1% for r<20, and are
dominated by red galaxies. Magnitude and redshift limited samples show that
radio galaxies have a different optical luminosity distribution than non-radio
galaxies selected by the same criteria; when galaxies are further separated by
their colors, this result remains valid for both blue and red galaxies. The
distributions of radio-to-optical flux ratio are similar for blue and red
galaxies in redshift-limited samples; this similarity implies that the
difference in their luminosity functions, and resulting selection effects, are
the dominant cause for the preponderance of red radio galaxies in flux-limited
samples. We confirm that the AGN-to-starburst galaxy number ratio increases
with radio flux, and find that radio emission from AGNs is more concentrated

dense environs with the gas density about 10 to 100 cm^-3 . For given spectrum
of the electron population, the ratio of the bremsstrahlung X- and gamma-ray
fluxes depends on the position of the ``Coulomb break'' in the electron
spectrum. The bulk of gamma-rays detected by EGRET would come from the
radio-bright and X-ray dim cloud at southeast, where very dense gas and strong
magnetic field would illuminate the cloud in the radio and gamma-ray bands, but
suppress the bremsstrahlung X-ray emission due to the shift of the ``Coulomb
break'' in the electron spectrum towards higher energies.

standing shock formation for accreting MHD plasma in a rotating, stationary and
axisymmetric black hole magnetosphere. All the postshock physical quantities
are expressed in terms of the relativistic compression ratio, which can be
obtained in terms of preshock quantities. Then, the downstream state of a
shocked plasma is determined by the upstream state of the accreting plasma. In
this paper sample solutions are presented for slow magnetosonic shocks for
accreting flows in the equatorial plane. We find that some properties of the
slow magnetosonic shock for the rotating magnetosphere can behave like a fast
magnetosonic shock. In fact, it is confirmed that in the limit of weak gravity
for the upstream non-rotating accretion plasma where the magnetic field lines
are leading and rotating, our results are very similar to the fast magnetosonic
shock solution by Appl and Camenzind (1988). However, we find that the
situation becomes far more complicated due to the effects of strong gravity and
rotation, such as the frame dragging-effects. We show the tendency that the
large spin of the black hole makes the slow magnetosonic shock strong for the
accretion solutions with the same energy-flux.

out the typical Z-shaped pattern. The study of the power spectral properties
showed that when the source moved on the Horizontal Branch towards the Normal
Branch the fractional rms amplitudes and timescales of all variability
decreased, while their FWHMs increased. The frequency separation of the two kHz
QPO peaks decreased from 344+-12 Hz to 232+-13 Hz. At low frequencies, besides
the horizontal branch oscillation (HBO) and its second harmonic, two additional
broad Lorentzian components were needed to obtain acceptable fits. These broad
Lorentzians have Q-values of ~1-2 and have frequencies 0.5 and 1.5 times the
HBO frequency. When interpreted as being related to the HBO, they seem to favor
disc models for the HBO over the magnetic beat-frequency model. We compare the

back hole candidate XTE J1550-564 and the atoll source 4U 1608-52. The CDs are
strikingly similar when a colour scheme is used that is commonly employed in

more complicated when colours common in neutron star studies are employed.

a hundred years ago, and their origin is still uncertain. Their main
constituents are the normal nuclei as in the standard cosmic abundances of
matter, with some enhancements for the heavier elements; there are also
electrons, positrons and anti-protons, but no anti-nuclei. Today we also have
information on isotopic abundances, which show some anomalies, as compared with
the interstellar medium. The known spectrum extends over energies from a few
hundred MeV to 3*10^{20} eV and shows few clear spectral signatures: There is a
small spectral break near 5*10^{15} eV, the ""knee"", where the spectrum turns
down; there is another spectral break near 3*10^{18} eV, the ""ankle"", where the
spectrum turns up again. Up to the ankle the cosmic rays are usually
interpreted as originating from Galactic supernova explosions; however, we do
not know what the origin of the knee is. The particles beyond the ankle have to
be extragalactic, it is usually assumed, because the Larmor radii in the
Galactic magnetic field are too large; this argument could be overcome if those
particles were very heavy nuclei as Fe, an idea which appears to be
inconsistent, however, with the airshower data immediately above the energy of
the ankle. Due to interaction with the cosmic microwave background there is a
strong cut-off expected near 5*10^{19} eV, which is, however, not seen; The
high energy cosmic rays beyond this ""GZK-cutoff"" (after its discoverers
Greisen, Zatsepin and Kuzmin) are the challenge to interpret. We will describe

constant is investigated further. For reasonable squashing of the three-sphere,
all three infilling solutions have real-valued actions which possess a ``cusp

even for larger deformations of the three-sphere, as long as a certain
inequality between $a$ and $b$ holds. The action of this solution is
proportional to $-a^{3}$ for large $a (\sim b)$ and hence larger radii are
favoured. The same boundary-value problem with more complicated interior

  Adapted from a chapter of the forthcoming book: QCD as a Theory of Hadrons:
  from partons to to confinement, Monograph series in Physics, Cambridge Univ.
  Press (to appear in 2002)",,,"PM 02/06","hep-ph hep-ex hep-lat nucl-th",,"  We review the present status for the determinations of the light and heavy
quark masses, the light quark chiral condensate and the decay constants of
light and heavy-light (pseudo)scalar mesons from QCD spectral sum rules (QSSR).
Bounds on the light quark running masses at 2 GeV are found to be: 6
MeV<(m_d+m_u)(2)<11 MeV and 71 MeV<m_s(2)<148 MeV. The agreement of the ratio
m_s/(m_u+m_d)=24.2 from pseudoscalar sum rules with the one (24.4\pm 1.5) from
ChPT indicates the consistency of the pseudoscalar sum rule approach. QSSR
predictions from different channels for the light quark running masses leads:
m_s(2)=(117.4\pm 23.4) MeV, (m_d+m_u)(2)=(10.1\pm 1.8) MeV,
(m_d-m_u)(2)=(2.8\pm 0.6) MeV with the corresponding values of the RG invariant
masses. The different QSSR predictions for the heavy quark masses lead to the
running masss values: m_c(m_c)=(1.23\pm 0.05) GeV and m_b(m_b)=(4.24\pm 0.06)
GeV, from which one can extract the scale independent ratio m_b/m_s=48.8\pm
9.8. Runned until M_Z, the b-quark mass becomes: m_b(M_Z)=(2.83\pm 0.04) GeV in
good agreement with the average of direct measurements (2.82\pm 0.63) GeV from
three-jet heavy quark production at LEP, and then supports the QCD running
predictions based on the renormalization group equation. As a result, we have
updated our old predictions of the weak decay constants f_{\pi'(1.3)},
f_{K'(1.46)}, f_{a_0(0.98)}, f_{K^*_0(1.43)}. We obtain from a global fit of
the light (pseudo)scalar and B_s mesons, the flavour breakings of the normal
ordered chiral condensate ratio: <ss>/<uu>=0.66\pm 0.10. The last section is
dedicated to the QSSR determinations of f_{D_{(s)}} and f_{B_{(s)}}.

phase transitions. One is the destabilized-stabilized phase transition of the
flat direction, which is in general induced by the Hubble parameter. The other
is the phase transition related to the A-term, which induces the misalignment
of the relative phase of the flat direction. In the conventional Affleck-Dine
baryogenesis they are supposed to start almost simultaneously. Of course these
phase transitions can take place separately, but the latter must not be later
than the former because the phase transition of the A-term can not produce any
baryon number when there is no condensate of the relative charge.
  In this paper we try to construct models where the original idea of
Affleck-Dine baryogenesis is realized in a different way. We show examples in
which the local domain of the false vacuum with the required condensate is
formed after inflation and collapses in a safe way so that the domain wall
problem is avoided. We also show examples where the phase transition of the
A-term starts before the decay of the condensate. As in the conventional
Affleck-Dine mechanism, the phase transition of the A-term produces baryon
number in the local domain of the condensate. We construct scenarios where our
mechanism produces sufficient baryon asymmetry of the Universe.

The critical size is estimated for a {\em strong clustering} (with a finite

using non-invasive instruments. For matching measurements, very few such
instruments are available. One candidate is a quadrupole pick-up. Therefore, a
new type of quadrupole pick-up has been developed for the 26 GeV Proton
Synchrotron (PS) at CERN, and a measurement system consisting of two such
pick-ups is now installed in this accelerator. Using the information from these
pick-ups, it is possible to determine both injection matching and emittance in
the horizontal and vertical planes, for each bunch separately. This paper
presents the measurement method and some of the results from the first year of
use, as well as comparisons with other measurement methods.

two bodies attract each other with a force proportional to the product of their
masses and the inverse square of the distance. The constant of proportionality,
G, is one of the fundamental constants of nature. As the precision of
measurements increased the disparity between the values of G, gathered by
different groups, surprisingly increased. This unique situation was reflected
by the 1998 CODATA decision to increase the relative G uncertainty from 0.013%
to 0.15 %. Our repetitive measurements of the gravitational constant (G) show
that G varies significantly with the orientation of the test masses relative to
the system of fixed stars, as was predicted by the Attractive Universe Theory.
The distances between the test masses were in the decimeter range. We have
observed that G changes with the orientation by at least 0.054%.

reflection from an evanescent wave mirror using velocity selective Raman
transitions. We have observed a double structure in the velocity distribution
after reflection: a peak consistent with specular reflection and a diffuse
reflection pedestal, whose contribution decreases rapidly with increasing
detuning. The diffuse reflection is due to two distinct effects: spontaneous
emission in the evanescent wave and a roughness in the evanescent wave
potential whose amplitude is smaller than the de Broglie wavelength of the
reflected atoms.

clarify and quantify how entanglement behaves when part of an entangled state
is sent through a quantum channel. Of central importance in the description of
a quantum channel or completely positive map (CP-map) is the dual state
associated to it. The present paper is a collection of well-known, less known
and new results on quantum channels, presented in a unified way. We will show
how this dual state induces nice characterizations of the extremal maps of the
convex set of CP-maps, and how normal forms for states defined on a Hilbert
space with a tensor product structure lead to interesting parameterizations of
quantum channels.

(with the effective number of degrees of freedom of order 10), initially in a
microcanonical state, will typically cause decoherence almost indistinguishable
from that by a macroscopic, thermal environment, except possibly at
singularities of the environment's specific heat (critical points). In the
latter case, the precise magnitude of the difference between the canonical and
