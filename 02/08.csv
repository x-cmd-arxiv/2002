J1747.0-2853 performed on 18 July 2001. We detected a bright source at the
position of R.A = 17^h 47^m 02.60^s and Dec. = -28 52' 58.9'' (J2000.0; with a
1 sigma error of ~0.7 arcseconds), consistent with the BeppoSAX and ASCA
positions of SAX J1747.0-2853 and with the Ariel V position of the transient GX
+0.2,-0.2, which was active during the 1970's. The 0.5-10 keV luminosity of the
source during our observations was ~3 x 10^{35} erg/s (assuming a distance of 9
kpc) demonstrating that the source was in a low-level accretion state. We also
report on the long-term light curve of the source as observed with the all sky
monitor aboard the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. After the initial 1998
outburst, two more outbursts (in 2000 and 2001) were detected with peak
luminosities about two orders of magnitude larger than our Chandra luminosity.
Our Chandra observation falls in-between those two outbursts, making the
outburst history for SAX J1747.0-2853 complex. Those bright 2000 and 2001
outbursts combined with the likely extended period of low level activity
in-between those outbursts strongly suggest that the classification of SAX
J1747.0-2853 as a faint X-ray transient was premature. It might be possible
that the other faint X-ray transients also can exhibit bright, extended
outbursts which would eliminate the need for a separate sub-class of X-ray
transients. We discuss our results also in the context of the behavior of X-ray
binaries accreting at low levels with luminosities around 10^{35} erg/s, a
poorly studied accretion rate regime.

generated by a torque due to external forces. This takes into account that the
warp is produced as a reorientation of the different rings which constitute the
disc in order to compensate the differential precession generated by the
external force, yielding a uniform asymptotic precession for all rings.
  Application of this method to gravitational tidal forces in the Milky Way due
to the Magellanic Clouds leads to a very low amplitude of the warp. If the
force were due to an extragalactic magnetic field, its intensity would have to
be very high, to generate the observed warps. An alternative hypothesis is
explored: the accretion of the intergalactic medium over the disk. A cup-shaped
distortion is expected, due to the transmission of the linear momentum; but,
this effect is small and the predominant effect turns out to be the
transmission of angular momentum, i.e. a torque giving an integral-sign shape
warp. The torque produced by a flow of velocity ~100 km/s and baryon density
\~10^{-25} kg/m^3 is enough to generate the observed warps and this mechanism
offers quite a plausible explanation. First, because this order of accretion
rate is inferred from other processes observed in the Galaxy, notably its
chemical evolution. The inferred rate of infall of matter, ~1 solar-mass/yr, to
the Galactic disc that this theory predicts agrees with the quantitative
predictions of this chemical evolution resolving key issues, notably the
G-dwarf problem. Second, because the required density of the intergalactic
medium is within the range of values compatible with observation. By this
mechanism, we can explain the warp phenomenon in terms of intergalactic
accretion flows onto the disk of the galaxy.

efficient at transforming the gas into stars is also found. We detect that
systems which do not experience early gas inflows have well-formed stellar
bulges and more concentrated potential wells, which seem to be responsible for
preventing further gas inward transport triggered by tidal forces. Our results
constitute the first proof that bulges can form as the product of collapse,

consistent with a rejuvenation of the stellar population in bulges at

galactic nuclei. They variously contain emission features associated with star
forming regions and absorptions by circumnuclear silicate dust plus ices in
cold molecular cloud material. Here we report the detection of 6-8um water ice
absorption in 18 galaxies observed by ISO. While the mid-IR spectra of some of
these galaxies show a strong resemblance to the heavily absorbed spectrum of
NGC 4418, other galaxies in this sample also show weak to strong PAH emission.
The 18 ice galaxies are part of a sample of 103 galaxies with good S/N mid-IR
ISO spectra. Based on our sample we find that ice is present in most of the
ULIRGs, whereas it is weak or absent in the large majority of Seyferts and
starburst galaxies. This result is consistent with the presence of larger
quantities of molecular material in ULIRGs as opposed to other galaxy types.
Like NGC 4418, several of our ice galaxy spectra show a maximum near 8um that
is not or only partly due to PAH emission. While this affects only a small part
of the galaxy population studied by ISO, it stresses the need for high S/N data
and refined diagnostic methods, to properly discriminate spectra dominated by
PAH emission and spectra dominated by heavy obscuration. The spectral variation
from PAH emission to absorbed continuum emission near 8um shows strong
similarities with Galactic star forming clouds. This leads us to believe that
our classification of ice galaxy spectra might reflect an evolutionary sequence
from strongly obscured beginnings of star formation (and AGN activity) to a
less enshrouded stage of advanced star formation (and AGN activity), as the
PAHs get stronger and the broad 8um feature weakens.

clusters, we show that any population synthesis model being based on stellar
libraries of the Milky Way is intrinsically biased towards super-solar alpha/Fe
ratios at metallicities below solar. We correct for this bias, so that the
models presented here reflect constant alpha/Fe ratios at all metallicities.
The use of such unbiased models is essential for studies of stellar systems
with sub-solar metallicities like (extragalactic) globular clusters or dwarf
galaxies.
  For the galaxy sample investigated here, we find a clear correlation between
alpha/Fe and velocity dispersion. Zero-point, slope, and scatter of this
correlation turn out to be independent of the environment. Additionally, the
alpha/Fe ratios and mean ages of elliptical galaxies are well correlated, i.e.
galaxies with high alpha/Fe ratios have also high average ages. This strongly
reinforces the view that the alpha/Fe element enhancement in ellipticals is
produced by short star formation timescales rather than by a flattening of the
initial mass function. The more massive the galaxy, the shorter is its star
formation timescale, and the higher is the redshift of the bulk of star
formation, independent of the environmental density. We show that this finding
is incompatible with the predictions from hierarchical galaxy formation models,
in which star formation is tightly linked to the assembly history of dark

a good description of the ~20 keV - 1 MeV gamma-ray emission of GRBs. We show
that this model provides excellent fits to the data and naturally explains the
observed global correlations between spectral parameters. In particular, we
show there exists a negative correlation between between the peak of the nu-Fnu
spectrum, Ep, and the low energy photon index \alpha for bursts with -2/3 <
\alpha < 0, and suggest that this correlation is due to the mechanism
responsible for producing \alpha's above the value of -2/3 - namely, a
decreasing mean pitch angle of the electrons. We then discuss the physical
origin of the increasing number of GRBs that are observed to peak in the X-ray
energy band (~5-40 keV). Although either a cosmological (i.e. high redshift) or
intrinsic interpretation for the low values of Ep is viable at this point, the
data appear to suggest that intrinsic effects are playing the dominant role.

low mass cloud cores already mapped in the NH3(1,1) inversion transition line.
The survey has been carried out at the FCRAO antenna with an angular resolution
about 1.5 times finer than the previous ammonia observations. Cores with stars
typically have map sizes about a factor of two smaller for N2H+ than for NH3,
indicating the presence of denser and more centrally concentrated gas compared
to starless cores. Significant correlations are found between NH3 and N2H+
column densities and excitation temperatures in starless cores, but not in
cores with stars, suggesting a different chemical evolution of the two species.
Velocity gradients range between 0.5 and 6 km/s/pc, similar to what has been
found with NH3 data. ``Local'' velocity gradients show significant variation in
both magnitude and direction, suggesting the presence of complexmotions not
interpretable as simple solid body rotation. Integrated intensity profiles of
starless cores present a ``central flattening'' and are consistent with a
spherically symmetric density law n ~ r^{-1.2} for r < ~0.03 pc and n ~ r^{-2}
at larger r. Cores with stars are better modelled with single density power
laws with n ~ r^{-2}. Line widths change across the core but we did not find a
general trend. The deviation in line width correlates with the mean line width,
suggesting that the line of sight contains ~ 10 coherence lengths. The
corresponding value of the coherence length, ~ 0.01 pc, is similar to the
expected cutoff wavelength for MHD waves. This similarity may account for the
increased ``coherence'' of line widths on small scales. Despite of the finer
angular resolution, the majority of N2H+ and NH3 maps show a similar ``simple''
structure, with single peaks and no elongation.

Anglo-Australian Telescope provides multiple object spectroscopy over a 2
degree field of view. Up to 400 target fibres can be independently positioned
by a complex robot. Two spectrographs provide spectra with resolutions of
between 500 and 2000, over wavelength ranges of 440nm and 110nm respectively.
The 2dF facility began routine observations in 1997.
  2dF was designed primarily for galaxy redshift surveys and has a number of
innovative features. The large corrector lens incorporates an atmospheric
dispersion compensator, essential for wide wavelength coverage with small
diameter fibres. The instrument has two full sets of fibres on separate field
plates, so that re-configuring can be done in parallel with observing. The
robot positioner places one fibre every 6 seconds, to a precision of 0.3 arcsec
(20micron) over the full field. All components of 2dF, including the
spectrographs, are mounted on a 5-m diameter telescope top-end ring for ease of
handling and to keep the optical fibres short in order to maximise UV
throughput . There is a pipeline data reduction system which allows each data
set to be fully analysed while the next field is being observed.
  In this paper we provide the historical background to the 2dF facility, the
design philosophy, a full technical description and a summary of the
performance of the instrument. We also briefly review its scientific
applications and possible future developments.

solitons in polyacetylene and other charge density wave systems, domain lines

we find a shape instability which lead, via phase transitions, to tilted
phases. Depending on the regime, elastic or confinement, the order of the
zero-temperature transition changes. Thermal fluctuations lead to a pure
Coulomb roughening of the string, in addition to the usual one, and to the
presence of angular kinks. We suggest that such instabilities might explain the
tilting of stripes in cuprate oxides. The 3D problem of the charged wall is
also analyzed. The latter experiences instabilities towards various tilted
phases separated by a tricritical point in the elastic regime. In the
confinement regime, the increase of dimensionality favors either the melting of
the wall into a Wigner crystal of its constituent charges or a strongly
inclined wall which might have been observed in nickelate oxides.

research tool among physicists, especially when applied to a dynamical system
fitting the conditions of validity of the Pesin theorem. The study of time
series that are a manifestation of system dynamics whose rules are either
unknown or too complex for a mathematical treatment, is still a challenge since
the KS entropy is not computable, in general, in that case. Here we present a
plan of action based on the joint action of two procedures, both related to the
KS entropy, but compatible with computer implementation through fast and
efficient programs. The former procedure, called Compression Algorithm
Sensitive To Regularity (CASToRe), establishes the amount of order by the
numerical evaluation of algorithmic compressibility. The latter, called Complex
Analysis of Sequences via Scaling AND Randomness Assessment (CASSANDRA),
establishes the complexity degree through the numerical evaluation of the
strength of an anomalous effect. This is the departure, of the diffusion
process generated by the observed fluctuations, from ordinary Brownian motion.
The CASSANDRA algorithm shares with CASToRe a connection with the Kolmogorov
complexity. This makes both algorithms especially suitable to study the
transition from dynamics to thermodynamics, and the case of non-stationary time
series as well. The benefit of the joint action of these two methods is proven
by the analysis of artificial sequences with the same main properties as the
real time series to which the joint use of these two methods will be applied in
future research work.

discretization of the CP^{N-1} model. We show that at N = \infty the order of
the transition is governed by lattice connectivity. At finite values of N, the
transition goes away in one or less dimension but survives on many lattices in
two dimensions and higher, for sufficiently large N. The latter conclusion
contradicts a recent conjecture of Sokal and Starinets, yet is consistent with
the known finite temperature behavior of the SU(2) case. We also report closely

contrary, in an inelastic light scattering study, we report a negative boron
isotope effect on the energy $\Omega$ of the gap-like feature in B$_{2g}$
symmetry, e.g., $\Omega(^{10}B)< \Omega(^{11}B)$. The origin of the effect is
discussed in terms of selective probing of a non-conventional electron-phonon
interaction on part of the Fermi surface, probably near the X point in the
Brillouin zone.

impurities substituted for Cu give rise to inhomogeneous charge and spin
distribution it is interesting to understand the interplay of Zn impurities and
stripes. To understand these points we have used Zn-doping and some of the
results obtained are as follows: The spectra show a strong dependence with
respect to the polarization angle, $\theta$, as is evident at any temperature
by comparing the spectra where the electric field vector is parallel with
ab-plane to the one where it is parallel to the c-axis. By using the XANES
[temperature] difference spectra we have determined T* [experimentally we find,
T* $\approx$ 160-170 K] for this sample. The XANES difference spectra shows
that the changes in XANES features are larger in the ab-plane than the c-axis,
this trend is expected since zinc is doped in the ab-plane at the copper site.
Our study also complements the results in literature namely that zinc doping
does not affect the c-axis transport.

networks has received much attention. Previous work suggests caching index
entries at intermediate nodes that lie on the paths taken by search queries,
but until now there has been little focus on how to maintain these intermediate
caches. This paper proposes CUP, a new comprehensive architecture for
Controlled Update Propagation in peer-to-peer networks. CUP asynchronously
builds caches of index entries while answering search queries. It then
propagates updates of index entries to maintain these caches. Under unfavorable
conditions, when compared with standard caching based on expiration times, CUP
reduces the average miss latency by as much as a factor of three. Under
favorable conditions, CUP can reduce the average miss latency by more than a
factor of ten.
  CUP refreshes intermediate caches, reduces query latency, and reduces network
load by coalescing bursts of queries for the same item. CUP controls and
confines propagation to updates whose cost is likely to be recovered by
subsequent queries. CUP gives peer-to-peer nodes the flexibility to use their
own incentive-based policies to determine when to receive and when to propagate
updates. Finally, the small propagation overhead incurred by CUP is more than
compensated for by its savings in cache misses.

looking at the theme in terms of ADG (: abstract differential geometry). Thus,

arguments, while still employing fundamental differential-geometric notions
such as connections, curvature, metric and the like, retaining also the form of
standard important relations of the classical theory (e.g. Einstein and/or
Yang-Mills equations, in vacuum), even within that generalized context of ADG.
To wind up, we can extend (in point of fact, {calculate) over singularities
classical differential-geometric relations/equations, without altering their
forms and/or changing the standard arguments; the change concerns thus only the
way, we employ the usual differential geometry of smooth manifolds, so that the
base ``space'' acquires now quite a secondary role, not contributing at all (!)
to the differential-geometric technique/mechanism that we apply. Thus, the
latter by definition refers directly to the objects being involved--the objects
that ``live on that space'', which by themselves are not, of course, ipso facto
``singular''!

framework allows one to truncate the translational equations of motion at any
well-defined order. Here, the post-Newtonian (PN) equations valid in the scalar
theory are truncated beyond the order eta^3. The PN approximation scheme used
is the asymptotic scheme, that expands all fields. To get the explicit form of

"math-ph/0202013","Fabio Martinelli","T. Bodineau and F. Martinelli","Some New Results on the Kinetic Ising Model in a Pure Phase",,,,,"math-ph math.MP math.PR",,"  We consider a general class of Glauber dynamics reversible with respect to
the standard Ising model in $\bbZ^d$ with zero external field and inverse
temperature $\gb$ strictly larger than the critical value $\gb_c$ in dimension
2 or the so called ``slab threshold'' $\hat \b_c$ in dimension $d \geq 3$. We
first prove that the inverse spectral gap in a large cube of side $N$ with plus
boundary conditions is, apart from logarithmic corrections, larger than $N$ in
$d=2$ while the logarithmic Sobolev constant is instead larger than $N^2$ in
any dimension. Such a result substantially improves over all the previous
existing bounds and agrees with a similar computations obtained in the
framework of a one dimensional toy model based on mean curvature motion. The
proof, based on a suggestion made by H.T. Yau some years ago, explicitly
constructs a subtle test function which forces a large droplet of the minus
phase inside the plus phase. The relevant bounds for general $d\ge 2$ are then
obtained via a careful use of the recent $\bbL^1$--approach to the Wulff
construction. Finally we prove that in $d=2$ the probability that two
independent initial configurations, distributed according to the infinite
volume plus phase and evolving under any coupling, agree at the origin at time
$t$ is bounded from below by a stretched exponential $\exp(-\sqrt{t})$, again
apart from logarithmic corrections. Such a result should be considered as a
first step toward a rigorous proof that, as conjectured by Fisher and Huse some
years ago, the equilibrium time auto-correlation of the spin at the origin
decays as a stretched exponential in $d=2$.

Kraichnan--Leith--Batchelor paradigm, based on the simultaneous conservation of

requires that the domain be unbounded in both directions. For two-dimensional
turbulence either in a doubly periodic domain or in an unbounded channel with a
periodic boundary condition in the across-channel direction, a direct enstrophy
cascade is not possible. In the usual case where the forcing wavenumber is no
greater than the geometric mean of the integral and dissipation wavenumbers,
constant spectral slopes must satisfy $\beta>5$ and $\alpha+\beta\ge8$, where
$-\alpha$ ($-\beta$) is the asymptotic slope of the range of wavenumbers lower

information processing. Here, we describe several optical interferometers that
signal the presence of a single photon in a particular input state without
destroying it. We discuss both entanglement-assisted and
non-entanglement-assisted interferometers, with ideal and realistic detectors.
We found that existing detectors with 88% quantum efficiency and single-photon
resolution can yield output fidelities of up to 89%, depending on the input
state. Furthermore, we construct expanded protocols to perform QND detections
of single photons that leave the polarization invariant. For detectors with 88%
efficiency we found polarization-preserving output fidelities of up to 98.5%.

in terms of two linear equations depending on an arbitrary function G. When $G$
and the potential are polynomials, the solutions of these two equations are
entire functions (L and K) and the zeroes of K are identical to those of the
wave function. Requiring such a zero at a large but finite value of the
argument yields the low energy eigenstates with exponentially small errors.
Judicious choice of G can improve dramatically the numerical treatment. The
method yields many significant digits with modest computer means.

particles, such that the transformation associated with each link of the
lattice is determined by the quantum state of the two particles joined by that
link. We focus particularly on a one-dimensional lattice--a ring--of entangled
rebits, which are binary quantum objects confined to a real state space. We
consider states of the ring that maximize the correlation between nearest
neighbors, and show that some correlation must be sacrificed in order to have
non-trivial parallel transport around the ring. An analogy is made with lattice
gauge theory, in which non-trivial parallel transport around closed loops is
associated with a reduction in the probability of the field configuration. We
discuss the possibility of extending our result to qubits and to higher
dimensional lattices.

quantum teleportation, and quantum cryptography. The ability to quantify this
resource correctly has thus become of great interest to those working in the
field of quantum information theory. In this paper, we show that all existing
entanglement measures but one fail important tests of fitness when applied to n
particle, m site states of indistinguishable particles, where n,m>=2. The
accepted method of measuring the entanglement of a bipartite system of
distinguishable particles is to use the von Neumann entropy of the reduced
density matrix of one half of the system. We show that expressing the full
density matrix using a site-spin occupation number basis, and reducing with
respect to that basis, gives an entanglement which meets all currently known
fitness criteria for systems composed of either distinguishable or
indistinguishable particles.
  We consider an output state from a previously published thought experiment, a
state which is entangled in both spin and spatial degrees of freedom, and show
that the site entropy measure gives the correct total entanglement. We also
show how the spin-space entanglement transfer occurring within the apparatus
can be understood in terms of the transfer of probability from single-occupancy
to double-occupancy sectors of the density matrix.
