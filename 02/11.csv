by previous generations of low resolution X-ray observatories. In the cores of
clusters, bright, irregular X-ray emission is now routinely seen within central
dominant galaxies (CDGs) harboring powerful radio sources. The radio sources
are interacting with and are often displacing the hot gas leaving cavities in
their wakes. The cavities rise buoyantly, transporting up to 10E61 ergs of
energy to the intracluster medium over the life of a cluster. The dynamically
important magnetic fields observed in cooling flows may have originated from
these cavities. The cooling rates found by Chandra and XMM-Newton are much
smaller than previously reported, and they are more in line with the levels of
cold gas and star formation seen in other bandpasses. I discuss the emerging
correlation between extended H-alpha emission, star formation, and bright X-ray
emission at locations where the cooling time of the keV gas approaches a few
hundred million years. Data from a variety of disciplines suggest repeated,
short duration bursts of cooling and star formation are occurring, possibly
induced and regulated in some instances by the central radio source. Finally, I
discuss the interesting possibility that radio sources quench cooling flows,
while emphasizing the difficulties with some proposed scenarios.

Submitted to ApJ","Astrophys.J. 575 (2002) 378-383","10.1086/341144",,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  It has been proposed recently that Galactic microquasars may be prodigious
emitters of TeV neutrinos that can be detected by upcoming km^2 neutrino
telescopes. In this paper we consider a sample of identified microquasars and
microquasar candiates, for which available data enables rough determination of
the jet parameters. By employing the parameters inferred from radio
observations of various jet ejection events, we determine the neutrino fluxes
that should have been produced during these events by photopion production in
the jet. Despite the large uncertainties in our analysis, we demonstrate that
in several of the sources considered, the neutrino flux at Earth, produced in
events similar to those observed, would exceed the detection threshold of a
km^2 neutrino detector. The class of microquasars may contain also sources with
bulk Lorentz factors larger than those characteristic of the sample considered
here, directed along our line of sight. Such sources, which may be very
difficult to resolve at radio wavelengths and hence may be difficult to
identify as microqusar candidates, may emit neutrinos with fluxes significantly
larger than typically obtained in the present analysis. These sources may
eventually be identified through their neutrino and gamma-ray emission.

mechanical energy in the outflows that is imparted to the surrounding medium as
a function of the density and temperature of this gas. We finally calculate the
total amount of non-gravitational heating from such outflows as a function of
the cluster potential and formation epoch. We show that outflows from broad
absorption line (BAL) and radio loud quasars can provide the required amount of
heating of the intracluster gas. We find that in this scenario most of the
heating takes place at $z \sim 1\hbox{--}4$, and that this ``preheating'' epoch

z=4.86(+/-0.03) which are photometrically selected by a combination of two
broad bands (R and i') and one narrow band (NB711; 7126A FWHM=73A). We derive
the luminosity functions (LFs) of the LAEs at Lya luminosity and at
UV-continuum (1700A) luminosity. The LFs show little evolution between z=3.4
and z=4.86 either in Lya or UV-continuum emission. The amplitude of the LAE LF
tends to decline at the bright magnitudes more rapidly than that of the LBG LF
at similar redshifts. We calculate the angular correlation function of our LAEs
up to ~15 arcmin separations. The angular correlation w(theta) is found to
increase with decreasing angular separations, showing a clear signal of
clustering. It is also found that the distribution of LAEs shows a large
density gradient with a scale of >~15 arcmin, which would indicate the
existence of a large-scale structure of LAEs on >~20h^(-1) Mpc scales.We fit
the observed correlation function by Aw theta^(-0.8) to find Aw=29arcsec^(0.8).
The estimated correlation length is r0=3.5(+/-0.3)h^(-1)Mpc in comoving units

correlation amplitude than the Lya faint sub-sample, while no significant

Galactic microquasar GRS 1915+105, observed on April 2000, during a
multi-wavelength campaign.
  During the three observations, a strong, variable low frequency (2-9 Hz)
quasi periodic oscillation (hereafter QPO), often referred to as the ubiquitous
QPO, is detected together with its first harmonic. We study the spectral
properties of both features, and show that : 1) their frequency variations are
better correlated with the soft X-ray flux (2-5 keV), favoring thus the
location of the QPO in the accretion disk; 2) the QPO affects more the hard
X-rays, usually taken as the signature of an inverse compton scattering of the
soft photons in a corona; 3) the fundamental and its harmonic do not behave in
the same manner: the fundamental sees its power increase with the energy up to
40 keV, whereas the harmonic increases up to $\sim 10$ keV. The results
presented here could find an explanation in the context of the
Accretion-Ejection Instability, which could appear as a rotating spiral or hot
point located in the disk, between its innermost edge and the corotation
radius. The presence of the harmonic could then be a signature of the
non-linear behavior of the instability. The high-energy (>40 keV) decrease of
the fundamental would favor an interpretation where most or all of the
quasi-periodic modulation at high energies comes, not from the comptonized
corona as usually assumed, but from a hot point in the optically thick disk

alternative. Moreover, a recent 500 kilosecond deep observation of the hard
X-ray continuum by BeppoSAX has revealed the positive detection of the 44Sc
nuclear decay lines at 67.9 and 78.4 keV. Appropriate modelling of the hard
X-ray continuum leads to an estimate of the initial 44Ti mass of (0.8-2.5)E-4
solar masses. We also present ionisation age, temperature, abundances maps. The
observed elemental abundance ratio patterns can be reconciled best with a type
Ib SNe, arising from a 60 solar mass progenitor (ZAMS) with high-mass-loss. The

Set-constraint techniques are used for formulating and checking verification
conditions for (parametric) polymorphic type specifications. The specifications
are expressed in a parametric extension of the formalism of term grammars. The
soundness of the method is proved and the prototype debugging tool supporting

approach to black hole quantization requires the horizon area eigenvalues to be
equally spaced. As stressed long ago by by Mukhanov, such eigenvalues must be
exponentially degenerate with respect to the area quantum number if one is to
understand black hole entropy as reflecting degeneracy of the observable
states. Here we construct the black hole states by means of a pair of ""creation
operators"" subject to a particular simple algebra, a slight generalization of
that for the harmonic oscillator. We then prove rigorously that the n-th area
eigenvalue is exactly 2 raised to the n-fold degenerate. Thus black hole
entropy qua logarithm of the number of states for fixed horizon area comes out
proportional to that area.

theory, going beyond the foundational work of the 1980s. This paper is a
tutorial and colloquial introduction to the explicit classification of Fano
3-folds (Q-Fano 3-folds), a subject that we hope is nearing completion. With
the intention of remaining accessible to beginners in algebraic geometry, we
include examples of elementary calculations of graded rings over curves and K3
surfaces. For us, K3 surfaces have at worst Du Val singularities and are
polarised by an ample Weil divisor; they occur as the general elephant of a
Fano 3-fold. A second section of the paper runs briefly through the classical
theory of nonsingular Fano 3-folds and Mukai's extension to indecomposable
Gorenstein Fano 3-folds. Ideas sketched out by Takagi at the Singapore
conference reduce the study of Q-Fano 3-folds with g>=2 to indecomposable
Gorenstein Fano 3-folds together with unprojection data.
  Much of the information about the anticanonical ring of a Fano 3-fold or K3
surface is contained in its Hilbert series. The Hilbert function is given by
orbifold Riemann--Roch (see Reid's Young Person's Guide); using this, we can
treat the Hilbert series as a simple collation of the genus and a basket of
cyclic quotient singularities. Many hundreds of families of K3s and Fano
3-folds are known, among them a large number with g<=0, and Takagi's methods do
not apply to these. However, in many cases, the Hilbert series already gives
firm indications of how to construct the variety by biregular or birational
methods. A final section of the paper introduces the K3 database in Magma, that
manipulates these huge lists without effort.

eigenvalue of D^{1/3}. This geometric situation can be used for constructing
Riemannian manifolds which are Ricci flat and admit a parallel spinor with

surface cell decompositions with quadrilateral faces, is given. The notion of
integrability laid in the basis of the classification is the three-dimensional
consistency. This property yields, among other features, the existence of the
discrete zero curvature with a spectral parameter. For all integrable systems
of the obtained exhaustive list, the so called three-leg forms are found. This
establishes Lagrangian and symplectic structures for these systems, and the
connection to discrete systems of the Toda type on arbitrary graphs.
Generalizations of these ideas to the three-dimensional integrable systems and
to the quantum context are also discussed.

from a phi^4 Lagrangian with minimal coupling to fermions. Decomposing the
scalar field into a mean-field part and fluctuations we obtain spontaneous pair
creation driven by a self-interacting strong background field. The produced
fermion and boson pairs are self-consistently coupled. Consequently back
reactions arise from fermion and boson currents determining the time dependent
self-interacting background mean-field. We explore the numerical solution in
flux tube geometry for the time evolution of the mean-field as well as for the
number- and energy densities for fermions and bosons. We find that after a
characteristic time all energy is converted from the background mean-field to
particle creation. Applying this general approach to the production of
``quarks'' and ``gluons'' a typical time scale for the collapse of the flux
tube is 1.5 fm/c.

the ground state energy and configuration for model metallic clusters. The
global minimum for a given N-atom cluster is found by following the damped
dynamics of the N particle system on an evolving potential energy surface. In
this application, the time dependent interatomic potential interpolates
adiabatically between the Lennard-Jones (LJ) and the Sutton-Chen (SC) forms.
Starting with an ensemble of initial conditions corresponding to the ground
state configuration of the Lennard-Jones cluster, the system asymptotically
reaches the ground state of the Sutton-Chen cluster. We describe the method and
present results for specific cluster size N=15, when the ground state symmetry
of LJ$_N$ and SC$_N$ differ.

thermodynamics to include quantum error correction. There is a standard
mechanism for describing errors that may occur during the transmission,
storage, and manipulation of quantum information. One can formulate a criterion
of necessary and sufficient conditions for the errors to be detectable and
correctable. We show that this criterion has a thermodynamical interpretation.

coordinatizing objects in the Quantum world, by picking Boolean figures and
subsequently opening Boolean windows for the perception of the latter,
interpreted as local measurement charts. A mathematical scheme for the
implementation of this thesis is being proposed based on Category theoretical
methods. The scheme leads to a manifold representation of Quantum structure in
terms of topos-theoretical Boolean reference frames. The coordinatizing objects
give rise to structure preserving maps with the modeling objects as their
domains, effecting finally an isomorphism between quantum event algebra objects
and Boolean localization systems for the masurement of observables.

whether the global clocking mechanism necessarily envolves irreversible
processes. However, one can show that it is not possible to extract any timing
information from a micro-physical clock without disturbing it. Applying recent
results of quantum information theory we can show a hardware-independent lower
bound on the timing information that is necessarily destroyed if one tries to
copy the signal. The bound becomes tighter for low energy signals, i.e., the
timing information gets more and more quantum.
