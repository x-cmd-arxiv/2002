means of a (3+1) hydrodynamical simulation in a post-Newtonian (PN) approxi-
mation of general relativity. This problem is particularly challenging because
of the vast dynamical range in space which must be covered in the course of
col- lapse. We evolve a uniformly rotating SMS from the onset of radial
instability at R_{p}/M=411, where R_{p} is the proper polar radius of the star
and M is the total mass-energy, to the point at which the PN approximation
breaks down. We introduce a scale factor and a ""comoving"" coordinate to handle
the large varia- tion in radius during the collapse and focus on the central
core. Since T/W, the ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the
gravitational binding energy, is nearly proportional to 1/R_{p} throughout the
collapse, the imploding star may ultimately exceed the critical value of T/W
for dynamical instability to bar-mode formation. However, for stars rotating
uniformly at the onset of col- lapse, we do not find any unstable growth of
bars prior to the termination of our simulation. We do find that the collapse
is likely to form a supermassive black hole (BH) coherently, with almost all of
the matter falling into the hole, leaving very little ejected matter to form a
disk. In the absence of nonaxi- symmetric bar formation, the collapse of a
uniformly rotating SMS does not lead to appreciable quasi-periodic
gravitational wave (GW) emission by the time our integrations terminate.
However, the coherent nature of the implosion suggests that rotating SMS
collapse will be a promising source of GW bursts. We also expect that,
following BH formation, long wavelength quasi-periodic waves will result from
quasi-normal ringing. These waves may be detectable by LISA.

stellar evolutionary models: in particular, it can be used to discriminate
among classical stellar models, in which the extension of the convective
regions is fixed by the classical Schwarzschild criterion, from models with
overshooting, in which an ``extra-mixing'' is considered to take place beyond
the classical limit of the convective zone. Addressing this subject in a recent
work, Testa et al. (1999) reached the conclusion that the classical scheme for
the treatment of convection represents a good and sufficient approximation for
convective interiors. Using their own data, we repeat here the analysis. First
we revise the procedure followed by Testa et al. (1999) to correct the data for
completeness, second we calculate new stellar models with updated physical
input for both evolutionary schemes, finally we present many simulations of the
colour-magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions of the cluster using the
ratio of the integrated luminosity function of main sequence stars to the
number of giants as the normalization factor of the simulations. We also take
into account several possible physical agents that could alter the
color-magnitude diagram and the luminosity function: they are unresolved binary
stars, dispersion in the age, stochastic effects in the initial mass function.
Their effect is analyzed separately, with the conclusion that binary stars have
the largest impact. The main result of this study is that the convective
overshoot hypothesis (together with a suitable percentage of unresolved
binaries) is really needed to fully match the whole pattern of data. The main
drawback of the classical models is that they cannot reproduce the correct
ratio of main sequence to post-main sequence stars.

the cosmic background radiation (CBR) at wavelengths >100 microns. At shorter
wavelengths, however, the 60-micron CBR intensity reported by Finkbeiner et al.
is less easily accounted for. Lagache et al. have proposed that this excess CBR
emission is a warm Galactic component, and the detection of the highest-energy
gamma-rays from blazars limits the CBR intensity at these wavelengths, but here
we investigate sources of this excess CBR emission, assuming that it has a
genuine extragalactic origin. We propose and test three explanations, each
involving additional populations not readily detected in existing submm-wave
surveys. First, dust-enshrouded galaxies with hot dust temperatures, perhaps
dust-enshrouded, Compton-thick AGN as suggested by recent deep Chandra surveys.
Secondly, a population of relatively low-redshift dusty galaxies with SEDs more
typical of the existing submm-selected galaxies, which could plausibly be
associated with the assembly of groups and clusters of galaxies. Thirdly, a
population of low-luminosity, cool, quiescent spiral galaxies. Hot AGN and the
assembly of groups can account for the excess 60-micron background. There are
significant problems with the cluster assembly scenario, in which too many
bright IRAS sources are predicted. Spiral galaxies have the wrong SEDs to
account for the excess. Future wide-field far-IR surveys using SIRTF and

investigate which elemental ratios could possibly be used as tracers of either
dust depletion or nucleosynthesis effects. We applied a component-by-component
analysis and show that the standard method which uses column densities
integrated over the whole absorption profiles could substantially underestimate
the abundance of rare elements relative to Fe. The apparent correlation we
found between [Mn/Fe] and [Zn/Fe] cannot be accounted for by any dust depletion
sequence: it implies either variations of the intrinsic Mn abundance relative
to Fe from -0.3 to +0.1 dex and/or a relation between depletion level and
metallicity. The correlation between [Mn/Fe] and metallicity strengthens the
assumption of intrinsic variations of [Mn/Fe] although some marginal
correlation between [Zn or Si/Fe] and [Zn/H] is present as well. The variations
of [Ti/Fe] vs. [Zn/Fe] cannot be fitted by a single dust depletion sequence
either. At high metallicity, [Fe/H]dc>~-0.5, the intrinsic (dust-corrected)
abundance pattern of Si, Ti, Cr and Mn in DLA absorbers closely follows the
trends observed in Galactic stars and these absorbers should thus have a
chemical evolution similar to that of our Galaxy. At lower metallicity, some
absorbers do follow the trends present in Galactic stars but a substantial
fraction of them have elemental ratios (in particular [Si/Fe]dc and [Mn/Fe]dc)
closer to the solar values than Galactic stars. This could be explained by a
larger contribution of type Ia supernovae to the chemical enrichment of these

poor seeing (between one and three arcseconds) negates much of the sensitivity
improvements that the Antarctic atmosphere offers, compared to mid-latitude
sites such as Mauna Kea or Cerro Paranal. The seeing at mid-latitude sites,
though smaller in amplitude, is dominated by turbulence at altitudes of 10 to
20 km. Over the Antarctic plateau, virtually no high altitude turbulence is
present in the winter. The mean square error for an astrometric measurement
with a dual-beam, differential astrometric interferometer in the very narrow
angle regime is proportional to the integral of $h^2 C_N^2(h)$. Therefore,
sites at which the turbulence occurs only at low altitudes offer large gains in
astrometric precision. We show that a modest interferometer at the South Pole

fractional circular polarization: the average spectrum is inverted with a
spectral index ~0.5 +/- 0.2; the degree of variability is roughly constant on
timescales of days to years; and, the degree of variability increases with
frequency. We also observed that the largest increase in fractional circular

sub-pixel repositioning of individual X-ray events. The resulting
subarcsecond-resolution images reveal that the soft (E < 0.7 keV) X-ray
emission from BD+30 is more uniform than the harder emission, which is largely
confined to the eastern rim of the optical nebula. In contrast, soft X-rays
from NGC 7027 are highly localized and this PN is more axially symmetric in
harder emission. The broad-band X-ray morphologies of BD+30 and NGC 7027 are
highly anticorrelated with their distributions of visual extinction, as
determined from high-resolution, space- and ground-based optical and infrared
imaging. Hence, it is likely that the observed X-ray asymmetries of these
nebulae are due in large part to the effects of nonuniform intranebular
extinction. However, the energy-dependent X-ray structures in both nebulae and
in NGC 6543 -- which is by far the least dusty and molecule-rich of the three
PNs, and displays very uniform intranebular extinction -- suggests that other
mechanisms, such as the action of collimated outflows and heat conduction, are
also important in determining the detailed X-ray morphologies of young
planetary nebulae.

  We assess ionization corrections for the observed column densities through
photoionization models derived from the CLOUDY software package. In the neutral

partially ionized gas, element abundance ratios differ from the ionic ratios by
0.1-0.3 dex for (SiII, SII, NiII, AlII)/FeII ratios and more for (NI,
ArI)/FeII. Independent of the shape of the photoionizing spectrum and
assumptions on the number of ionization phases, these ionization corrections
have minimal impact (<0.1dex) on the total metallicity inferred for this damped

effects of nucleosynthesis and dust depletion.
  We caution the reader that this damped system is unusual for a number of

types derived for our target sample are found to be in the range K6-M8.5, which
corresponds to a mass interval of roughly 1.2-0.02 Msun on the basis of
state-of-the-art evolutionary models. Radial velocities (except for one object)
are found to be consistent with membership in the Orion complex. All cluster
members show considerable Halpha emission and LiI in absorption, which is
typical of very young ages. We find that our pseudo-equivalent widths appear
rather dispersed (and intense in the case of Halpha) for objects cooler than
M3.5 spectral class, occurring at the approximate mass where low mass stars are
expected to become fully convective. The least massive brown dwarf in our
sample, SOri 45 (M8.5, ~0.02 Msun), displays variable Halpha emission and a
radial velocity that differs from the cluster mean velocity. Tentative
detection of forbidden lines in emission indicates that this brown dwarf may be
accreting mass from a surrounding disk. We also present recent computations of
LiI curves of growth for low gravities and for the temperature interval (about
4000-2600 K) of our sample. The comparison of our observations to these
computations allows us to infer that no lithium depletion has yet taken place
in sigma Orionis, and that the observed pseudo-equivalent widths are consistent
with a cluster initial lithium abundance close to the cosmic value. Hence, the
upper limit to the sigma Orionis cluster age can be set at 8 Myr, with a most
likely value around 2-4 Myr.

be important in determining the ionization state and metallicity of the
innermost regions of active galaxies. Calculations of reflection from a
constant-density disc with an ionization parameter between 250 and 1000 erg
cm/s show that emission from O VIII Ly\alpha will dominate the soft X-ray
emission spectrum. There is also significant emission from C VI, N VII, O VII,
as well as Fe XVII--XIX. As the ionization parameter is increased these lines
become weaker and are broadened by Compton scattering. Significantly increasing
the O abundance primarily strengthens the O VII line, making it as large or
larger than the O VIII line. The nitrogen and carbon lines are quite weak with
equivalent widths (EWs) <30 eV, even with an increase in the N abundance. A
hydrostatic ionized disc model has a more realistic density structure and shows
a similar spectrum, but with the lines weaker and broader. This is a result of
the hot ionized skin at the surface of the disc. We apply these results to the
controversial claim of soft X-ray relativistic lines in the XMM-Newton spectrum
of MCG--6-30-15. We are unable to find a situation where O VIII has the
required EW without substantial emission from O VII. Furthermore, Compton
scattering results in the blue wing of the O VIII line to be much broader than
the << 10 eV drop observed in the data. We conclude that soft X-ray accretion
disc lines will, in general, be weak and broad features and are unlikely to
produce sharp edges in the data.

of observations ever performed for this source, covering the wide energy band
in radio (13.3-0.3 cm), near-infrared (J-H-K), X-rays and Gamma-rays (from 1
keV to 10 MeV). During the campaign GRS 1915+105 was predominantly in the
""plateau"" (or low/hard) state but sometimes showed soft X-ray oscillations:
before April 20.3, rapid, quasi-periodic (~= 45 min) flare-dip cycles were
observed. The radio flares observed on April 17 shows frequency- dependent peak
delay, consistent with an expansion of synchrotron-emitting region starting at
the transition from the hard-dip to the soft-flare states in X-rays. On the
other hand, infrared flares on April 20 appear to follow (or precede) the
beginning of X-ray oscillations with an inconstant time delay of ~= 5-30 min.
This implies that the infrared emitting region is located far from the black
hole by >~ 10E13 cm, while its size is <~ 10E12 cm constrained from the time
variability. We find a good correlation between the quasi-steady flux level in
the near-infrared band and in the X-ray band. From this we estimate that the
reprocessing of X-rays, probably occurring in the outer parts of the accretion
disk, accounts for about 20-30% of the observed K magnitude in the plateau
state. The OSSE spectrum in the 0.05-10 MeV band is represented by a single
power law with a photon index of 3.1 extending to ~1 MeV with no cutoff. The
power-law slope above ~30 keV is found to be very similar between different
states in spite of large flux variations in soft X-rays, implying that the
electron energy distribution is not affected by the change of the state in the
accretion disk.

We study the dynamics of the kinematically decoupled core (KDC) in IC1459 and
we find it consists of stars that are well-separated from the rest of the
galaxy in phase space. The stars in the KDC counterrotate in a disk on orbits
that are close to circular. We estimate that the KDC mass is ~0.5% of the total
galaxy mass or ~3*10^9 Msun. We estimate the central black hole mass M_BH of
IC1459 independently from both its stellar and its gaseous kinematics. Some
complications probably explain why we find rather discrepant BH masses with the
different methods. The stellar kinematics suggest that M_BH = (2.6 +/-
1.1)*10^9 Msun (3 sigma error). The gas kinematics suggests that M_BH ~
3.5*10^8 Msun if the gas is assumed to rotate at the circular velocity in a
thin disk. If the observed velocity dispersion of the gas is assumed to be
gravitational, then M_BH could be as high as ~1.0*10^9 Msun. These different
estimates bracket the value M_BH = (1.1 +/- 0.3)*10^9 Msun predicted by the
M_BH-sigma relation. It will be an important goal for future studies to assess
the reliability of black hole mass determinations with either technique. This
is essential if one wants to interpret the correlation between the BH mass and

this deviation is small in the case of weak momentum dependence of the vertex,

Diffusion Search (SDS), a distributed agent-based system for best-fit pattern
matching. SDS operates by allocating simple agents into different regions of

the pattern in the search space and its potential distortion. Assuming a
compositional structure of hypotheses about pattern matching agents perform an
inference on the basis of partial evidence from the hypothesised solution.
Agents posing mutually consistent hypotheses about the pattern support each
other and inhibit agents with inconsistent hypotheses. This results in the
emergence of a stable agent population identifying the desired solution.
Positive feedback via diffusion of information between the agents significantly
contributes to the speed with which the solution population is formed. The
formulation of the SDS model in terms of interacting Markov Chains enables its
characterisation in terms of the allocation of agents, or computational
resources. The analysis characterises the stationary probability distribution
of the activity of agents, which leads to the characterisation of the solution

invariance are found to be physically irrelevant as they can be removed from
the lagrangian using an appropriate redefinition of the spinor field
components. It is shown that conserved currents may be defined using a modified
action of the complex extension of the Lorentz group on the redefined spinors.
This implies a natural correspondence between the apparently Lorentz-violating
theory and conventional QED. Redefinitions involving derivatives are shown to
relate certain terms in the QED extension to lagrangians involving nonlocal
interactions or skewed coordinate systems. The redundant parameters in the QED
extension are identified and the lagrangian is rewritten in terms of physically
relevant coupling constants. The resulting lagrangian contains only physically

provides a new method of breaking some continuous symmetries. A global
$G_{\text{cts}} \otimes G_{\text{discrete}}$ symmetry is spontaneously broken
to $H_{\text{cts}} \otimes H_{\text{discrete}}$, where the continuous subgroup
$H_{\text{cts}}$ can be embedded in several different ways in the parent group
$G_{\text{cts}}$, and $H_{\text{discrete}} < G_{\text{discrete}}$. A certain
class of topological domain wall solutions connect two vacua that are invariant
under {\it differently embedded} $H_{\text{cts}}$ subgroups. There is then
enhanced symmetry breakdown to the intersection of these two subgroups on the
domain wall. This is the ``clash''. In the brane limit, we obtain a
configuration with $H_{\text{cts}}$ symmetries in the bulk but the smaller
intersection symmetry on the brane itself. We illustrate this idea using a
permutation symmetric three-Higgs-triplet toy model exploiting the distinct

of the vacuum manifold can be treated symmetrically through the construction of
a three-fold planar domain wall junction configuration, with our universe at

high genus have the ratio \delta of the degree to the genus close to
half-integer values, usually \delta \approx 0, \delta \approx 1/2, or \delta
\approx 1; the numeric properties are very different in these three cases. This
leads to three different theories for curves of infinite genus.
  For analytic curves of infinite genus, to get a theory parallel to algebraic
geometry one needs to restrict attention to holomorphic sections satisfying
some ``conditions on growth at infinity''. Each such condition effectively
attaches an ``ideal point'' to the curve; this process is similar to
compactification.
  The theory of holomorphic functions on curves with such ``ideal points'' is
developed (the variant presented in the first part of the series is tuned to
the case \delta \approx 0). Conditions on the ``lengths of handles'' of the
curve are found which ensure the geometry to be parallel to algebraic geometry.
  It turns out that these conditions give no restriction on the density of
ideal points on the curve. In particular, such curves may have a dense set of
ideal points; these curves have no smooth points at all, and have a purely
fractal nature. (Such ``foam'' curves live near the ``periphery'' of the
corresponding g = \infty moduli space; one needs to study these curves too,
since they may be included in the support of natural measures arising on the
moduli spaces.)

forms of arbitrary symmetry, are treated in a broad sense. Five alternative
constructions of QCAs are exhibited. Grade free Hopf gebraic product formulas
are derived for meet and join of Grassmann-Cayley algebras including co-meet
and co-join for Grassmann-Cayley co-gebras which are very efficient and may be
used in Robotics, left and right contractions, left and right co-contractions,
Clifford and co-Clifford products, etc. The Chevalley deformation, using a
Clifford map, arises as a special case. We discuss Hopf algebra versus Hopf
gebra, the latter emerging naturally from a bi-convolution. Antipode and
crossing are consequences of the product and co-product structure tensors and
not subjectable to a choice. A frequently used Kuperberg lemma is revisited
necessitating the definition of non-local products and interacting Hopf gebras
which are generically non-perturbative. A `spinorial' generalization of the
antipode is given. The non-existence of non-trivial integrals in
low-dimensional Clifford co-gebras is shown. Generalized cliffordization is
discussed which is based on non-exponentially generated bilinear forms in
general resulting in non unital, non-associative products. Reasonable
assumptions lead to bilinear forms based on 2-cocycles. Cliffordization is used
to derive time- and normal-ordered generating functionals for the
Schwinger-Dyson hierarchies of non-linear spinor field theory and spinor
electrodynamics. The relation between the vacuum structure, the operator
ordering, and the Hopf gebraic counit is discussed. QCAs are proposed as the
natural language for (fermionic) quantum field theory.

SIS up to collider energies is presented. A statistical model assuming chemical
equilibrium and local strangeness conservation (i.e. strangeness conservation
per collision) explains most of the observed features.
  Emphasis is put onto the study of $K^+$ and $K^-$ emission at low incident
energies. In the framework of this statistical model it is shown that the
experimentally observed equality of $K^+$ and $K^-$ rates at
``threshold-corrected'' energies $\sqrt{s} - \sqrt{s_{th}}$ is due to a
crossing of two excitation functions. Furthermore, the independence of the
$K^+/K^-$ ratio on the number of participating nucleons observed between SIS
and RHIC is consistent with this model.
  It is demonstrated that the $K^-$ production at SIS energies occurs
predominantly via strangeness exchange and that this channel is approaching
chemical equilibrium. The observed maximum in the $K^+/\pi^+$ excitation
function is also seen in the ratio of strange to non-strange particle
production. The appearance of this maximum around 30 $A\cdot$GeV is due to the
energy dependence of the chemical freeze-out parameters $T$ and $\mu_B$.

contribution of vertex dressings to the two-body bound state mass for scalar
QED are cancelled by the self-energy and wavefunction normalization. This
proves, for the first time, that the mass of a two-body bound state given by
the full theory can in a very good approximation be obtained by summing only
ladder and crossed ladder diagrams using a bare vertex and a constant dressed
mass. We also discuss the implications of the remarkable cancellation between
rainbow and crossed rainbow diagrams that is a feature of one-body
calculations.

scattering angle as those obtained by Aharonov and Bohm (AB) in the string
limit and by Landau and Lifshitz (LL) for the non relativistic case. We show
that taking pr_0 sin(theta/2) << 1 in our expression of the differential cross
section it reduces to that one reported by AB, and if additionally we assume
theta << 1 our result becomes the one obtained by LL. However, these limits are
explicitly singular in hbar as opposed to our initial result. We analyse the
singular behavior in hbar and show that the perturbative Planck limit (hbar ->
