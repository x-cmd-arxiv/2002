other nearby edge-on galaxies. Our Galactic center survey provides an
unprecedented high-resolution, broad-band X-ray panorama of a 0.8x2 square
degree swath along the Galactic plane. Our preliminary analysis has led a
detection of about 1000 discrete sources. We find that the diffuse X-ray
emission dominates over the contribution from faint discrete sources and is
globally associated with distinct interstellar structures observed at radio and
mid-infrared wavelengths. We study how high-energy activities in the center
region affect the immediate vicinity and may influence other aspects of the
Galaxy. We have further observed nearby edge-on late-type disk galaxies in
fields of low foreground Galactic extinction to gain external perspectives of
the global disk/halo interaction. We have detected a giant diffuse
X-ray-emitting corona around the galactic disk of NGC 4631. Extraplanar diffuse
X-ray emission is also detected around NGC 3556. These X-ray-emitting coronae
morphologically resemble the radio halos of these galaxies, indicating a close
connection between outflows of hot gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic field from
the galactic disks. There is only marginal evidence for extraplanar diffuse
X-ray emission in NGC 4244 -- a galaxy with an extremely low star formation
rate. In general, the extraplanar diffuse X-ray emission is evidently related
to recent massive star forming activities in the galactic disks, especially in
their central regions.

collisionless shock waves, where electrons can accelerate to highly
relativistic energies. Such electrons can Compton scatter cosmic microwave
background photons up to gamma-ray energies. We study the radiation emitted in
this process using a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation of a LCDM universe.
This radiation, extending beyond TeV energies, has roughly constant energy flux
per decade in photon energy, in agreement with the predictions of Loeb & Waxman
(2000). Assuming that a fraction xi_e=0.05 of the shock thermal energy is
transferred to relativistic electrons, as inferred from collisionless
non-relativistic shocks in the interstellar medium, we find that the radiation
energy flux, e^2(dJ/de)~ 50-160 eV cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1, constitutes ~10% of the
extragalactic gamma-ray background. The associated point-sources are too faint
to account for the ~60 unidentified EGRET gamma-ray sources, but GLAST should
resolve several sources associated with large-scale IGM structures for
xi_e~0.03, and many more sources for larger xi_e. The intergalactic origin of
the radiation can be verified through a cross-correlation with, e.g., the
galaxy distribution that traces the same structure. Its shock-origin may be
tested by a cross-correlation with radio synchrotron radiation, emitted as the
same electrons gyrate in post-shock magnetic fields. We predict that GLAST and
Cherenkov telescopes such as MAGIC, VERITAS and HESS should resolve gamma-rays
from nearby (redshifts z < 0.01) rich galaxy clusters, perhaps in the form of a
\~5-10 Mpc diameter ring-like emission tracing the cluster accretion shock,
with luminous peaks at its intersections with galaxy filaments detectable even
at z~0.025.

including the X-ray properties of the nucleus, the radio hot spots, the cluster
of galaxies, the prolate cavity in the ICM inflated by the radio jets and
``bands'' of thermal gas which encircle the cavity in its equatorial plane. The
hard X-ray emission of the nucleus extends to 100 keV and originates from an
unresolved source absorbed by a large column density (N$_{\rm H}$ $\simeq$ 2
$\times$ 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) of gas. The soft ($<$ 2 keV) nuclear emission
exhibits a bi-polar structure which extends $\simeq$ 2 kpc from the nucleus and
is strongly correlated with both optical continuum and emission-line
morphologies. It is suggested that this nebulosity is photoionized by the
nucleus and that the extended X-rays are electron-scattered nuclear radiation.
All four radio hot spots are detected in X-rays, with the emission resulting
from synchrotron self-Compton radiation in an approximately equipartition
field. The temperature of the X-ray emitting intracluster gas drops from
$\simeq 8$ keV more than 100 kpc from the center to $\simeq 5$ keV some 80 kpc
from the center, with the coolest gas immediately adjacent to the radio galaxy.
There is a metallicity gradient in the X-ray emitting gas, with the highest
metallicities ($\sim$ solar) found close to the center, decreasing to $\sim
0.3$ solar in the outer parts. (Abstract truncated).

difficult to establish the pre-merger mass of the colliding system. We provide
tentative evidence that the subcluster is in fact the remnant core of a
moderately massive cluster, stripped by the collision with 1E0657-56. The main
cluster dynamics does not seem to have suffered from this collision. On the

distributions (SED). Thermal dust emission at two temperatures (one cold at
15-30K and one warm at 50-70K) can fit the 60-200 micron SED, with a dust
emissivity law proportional to the inverse square of the wavelength. Seyfert
1's and Seyfert 2's are indistinguishable longward of 100 micron, while, as
already seen by IRAS, the former have flatter SEDs shortward of 60 micron. A
mild anti-correlation is found between the [200 - 100] color and the ""60 micron

starburst component, and thus a strong 60 micron flux, have a steeper
far-infrared turnover. In non-Seyfert galaxies, increasing the luminosity
corresponds to increasing the star formation rate, that enhances the 25 and 60
micron emission. This shifts the peak emission from around 150 micron in the
most quiescent spirals to shorter than 60 micron in the strongest starburst

the 3d elements. We also find that Cr and Mn in MgB_{2} have a relatively large
local magnetic moment of 2.43 \mu_{B} and 2.87 \mu_{B}, respectively. We have
used the unpolarized, self-consistent potentials of Mg_{0.97}TM_{0.03}B_{2}
alloys, obtained within the coherent- potential approximation, to calculate the
electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda using the Gaspari-Georffy formalism
and the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} using the Allen-Dynes
equation. We find that the calculated T_{c} is the lowest for
Mg_{0.97}Cr_{0.03}B_{2} and the highest for Mg_{0.97}Zn_{0.03}B_{2}, in
qualitative agreement with experiment. The calculated trend in variation of
T_{c} from Mn to Zn is also similar to the available experimental data. Our
analysis of the variation in T_{c}, in terms of the DOS and the spectral
function along \Gamma to A direction, shows the variation to be an interplay
between the total DOS at the Fermi energy and the creation/removal of states
along \Gamma to A direction [P. P. Singh, cond-mat/0201093].

infinite time towards a distribution P(y). In this paper, we revisit this

result of Golosov by computing explicitly the joint asymptotic distribution of
relative position y=x(t)-m(t) and relative energy u=U(x(t))-U(m(t)) for the

function C(l) representing the disorder-averaged probability that two particles
of the thermal packet are at a distance l from each other. We moreover prove

relations. The numerical values of the avalanche exponents are close to the
conventional KPZ values, but differ sufficiently to warrant a detailed study of
whether avalanche correlated Monte Carlo sampling changes the scaling exponents
of KPZ interfaces. We demonstrate that the exponents remain unchanged, but that
the traces left on the surface by previous avalanches give rise to unusually
strong finite-size corrections to scaling. This type of slow convergence seems
intrinsic to avalanche dynamics.

world generally behaves. We look for a plausible definition of the set of all

paper, S. Kraus and the authors defined and studied ""preferential"" consequence
relations. They noticed that not all preferential relations could be considered
as reasonable inference procedures. This paper studies a more restricted class
of consequence relations, ""rational"" relations. It is argued that any
reasonable nonmonotonic inference procedure should define a rational relation.
It is shown that the rational relations are exactly those that may be
represented by a ""ranked"" preferential model, or by a (non-standard)
probabilistic model. The rational closure of a conditional knowledge base is
defined and shown to provide an attractive answer to the question of the title.
Global properties of this closure operation are proved: it is a cumulative
operation. It is also computationally tractable. This paper assumes the

gauge symmetry is partially broken to SU(2). It is shown that the chiral flavor
anomaly provides a wee-gluon component for Goldstone bosons that combines with
interactions due to the U(1) anomaly to produce an infra-red transverse
momentum scaling divergence in scattering amplitudes. After the divergence is
factorized out, as a wee-gluon condensate in the infinite momentum pion, the
remaining physical amplitudes have confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. A
lowest-order contribution to the pion scattering amplitude is calculated in
detail. Although originating from very complicated diagrams, the amplitude has
a remarkable (semi-)perturbative simplicity. The momentum structure is that of
single gluon exchange but zero momentum quarks inject additional spin and color
structure via anomaly interactions.

tested on a Bethe-Salpeter (second order) formalism which was successfully
applied in previous papers to an overall evaluation of the spectrum in the
light-light, light-heavy and heavy-heavy sectors (the only serious discrepancy
with data being for the light pseudoscalar meson masses). In this paper only
the {\rm c} \bar{\rm c}, {\rm b} \bar{\rm b} and {\rm q} \bar{\rm q} (q = u or
d) cases are considered and fine structure is neglected. It is found that in
the {\rm b} \bar{\rm b} and {\rm c} \bar{\rm c} cases the results are little
sensitive to the specific choice. In the light-light case the Dokshitzer et al.
prescription is again essentially equivalent to the truncation prescription
used in the previous calculation and it is consistent with the same a priori
fixing of the quark light masses on the typical current values m_{\rm u} =
m_{\rm d} = 10 MeV (only the pion mass resulting completely out of scale of
about 500 MeV). With the Shirkov-Solovtsov prescription, on the contrary, a
reasonable agreement with the data is obtained only at the price of using a
phenomenological momentum dependent effective mass for the quark. The use of
such an effective mass should amount to a correction of the free quark
propagator. It is remarkable that this has also the effect of bringing the pion
mass in the correct range.

set of primes of K including all those dividing n and all real archimedean
places. We consider the cup product on the first Galois cohomology group of the
maximal S-ramified extension of K with coefficients in n-th roots of unity,
which yields a pairing on a subgroup of the multiplicative group of K
containing the S-units. In this general situation, we determine a formula for
the cup product of two elements which pair trivially at all local places.
  Our primary focus is the case that K is the cyclotomic field of p-th roots of
unity for n = p an odd prime and S consists of the unique prime above p in K.
We describe a formula for this cup product in the case that one element is a
p-th root of unity. We explain a conjectural calculation of the restriction of
the cup product to p-units for all p < 10,000 and conjecture its surjectivity
for all p satisfying Vandiver's conjecture. We prove this for the smallest
irregular prime p = 37, via a computation related to the Galois module
structure of p-units in the unramified extension of K of degree p.

structure of S-class groups in Kummer extensions of K, to relations in the
Galois group of the maximal pro-p extension of K unramified outside p, to
relations in the graded Z_p-Lie algebra associated to the representation of the

projective algebraic surfaces over a field of char 0. We develop a theoretical
framework to study them by using so-called higher normal functions and higher
infinitesimal invariants when the cycles are supported on normal crossing
divisors. Then we investigate their structure on hypersurfaces in projective
3-space. This leads to vanishing or decomposbility results. On the other hand
we find examples of these groups in degrees 4 and 5 where the result is a
highly indecomposably (hence big) abelian group. Part of the examples are due
to Alberto Collino.

subgroup of $A_S$ generated by $X$. When $A_S$ is of spherical type, we prove
that the normalizer and the commensurator of $A_X$ in $A_S$ are equal and are
the product of $A_X$ by the quasi-centralizer of $A_X$ in $A_S$. Looking to the
associated monoids $A_S^+$ and $A_X^+$, we describe the quasi-centralizer of
$A_X^+$ in $A_S^+$ thanks to results in Coxeter groups. These two results
generalize earlier results of Paris. Finaly, we compare, in the spherical case,
the normalizer of a parabolic subgroup in the Artin-Tits group and in the

property of Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes and the corresponding

formula for the Milnor-class of a local complete intersection in a smooth

Parusinski-Pragacz.

reinterpreted from the point of view of topological field theories in the
Batalin-Vilkovisky or BRST formalisms. Namely, topological action functionals
for gauge fields (generalizing Chern-Simons and BF theories) are considered
together with generalized Wilson loops. The latter generate a (Poisson or
Gerstenhaber) algebra of functionals with values in the $S^1$-equivariant
cohomology of the loop space of the manifold on which the theory is defined. It
is proved that, in the case of $GL_n$ with standard representation, the
(Poisson or BV) bracket of two generalized Wilson loops applied to two cycles
is the same as the generalized Wilson loop applied to the string bracket of the
cycles. Generalizations to other groups are briefly described.

which include the population dynamics of several interacting species. We focus
on the question of the stability of such webs. The third class are species
assembly models and evolutionary models, which build webs starting from a few
species by adding new species through a process of ""invasion"" (assembly models)
or ""speciation"" (evolutionary models). Evolutionary models are found to be
capable of building large stable webs.

renormalization of the bare diffusion coefficient. Results have been obtained

temperature fluctuations, our data support the idea that the most relevant
statistical properties can be captured solely in terms of two scaling
exponents, characterizing the entire mixed layer. Such exponents control
asymptotic (i.e. core and tails) rescaling properties of the probability
density functions of equal-time temperature differences, $\Delta_r \theta$,
between points separated by a distance ${\bm r}$. A link between statistical
properties of large temperature fluctuations and geometrical properties of the
set hosting such fluctuations is also provided. Finally, a possible application
of our new findings to the problem of subgrid-scale parameterizations for the
temperature field in a convective boundary layer is discussed.

that this entropy takes a stationary value for the ground state, modulo a unit

the ratio of the position lattice spacing and the momentum lattice spacing. It
