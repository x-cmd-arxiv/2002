measurable interval, viz. the Planck time $t_P$, set by quantum fluctuations in
the vacuum metric tensor. By the Relativity Principle, the same limit must then
apply to the accuracy of all clocks which register time of events in their own
frames. Further, it implies that the ordinary meaning of distance also ceases
in the same manner beyond a scale l_P = c t_P. We demonstrate that quantum
space-time, if real, may be made manifest by observing very energetic
collisions, defined as interactions which occurred with the center-of-mass
frame $\Sigma'$ (of the participating bodies) moving at a high speed $v$
relative to our laboratory frame $\Sigma$. In such situations, the initial
conditions of the interaction are determined from direct measurements of the
ultra-energetic particles or photons by instruments aboard $\Sigma$: they
gather a raw dataset ${\cal S}$ which are subject to the limiting uncertainties
\~ (t_P, l_P). Yet a meaningful (i.e. experimentally verified) version of the
interaction is one where the interaction is viewed from frame $\Sigma'$. Since
no instruments aboard $\Sigma'$ have taken any data, the way we proceeded is by
a Lorentz transformation of ${\cal S}$ from $\Sigma$ to $\Sigma'$. Beware
however that the resulting ${\cal S'}$ no longer consists of raw data, i.e.
Lorentz distortions of probability distributions render the uncertainties
non-Planckian - in fact, it will be shown that as v -> c they are >> (t_P,
l_P), and are no longer negligible. Examples will given to indicate how a
proper interpretation of the most current high energy cosmic and gamma-ray data
necessitates incorporation of the said effect.

stars act as sources for the composition of the interstellar medium. Cosmic
rays are related to the latter and very probably due to acceleration of the
mixed interstellar medium by shock waves from supernova remnants. Thus, the
understanding of the abundance evolution in the interstellar medium and
especially the enrichment of heavy elements, as a function of space and time,
is essential. It reflects the history of star formation and the lifetimes of
the diverse contributing stellar objects. Therefore, the understanding of the
endpoints of stellar evolution is essential as well. These are mainly planetary
nebulae and type II/Ib/Ic supernovae as evolutionary endpoints of single stars,
but also events in binary systems can contribute, like e.g. supernovae of type
Ia, novae and possibly X-ray bursts and neutron star or neutron star - black
hole mergers. Despite many efforts, a full and self-consistent understanding of
supernovae (the main contributors to nucleosynthesis in galaxies) is not
existing, yet. Their fingerprints, however, seen either in spectra,
lightcurves, radioactivities/decay gamma-rays or in galactic evolution, can
help to constrain the composition of their ejecta and related model
uncertainties.

the disk from which it forms promote eccentricity growth. These interactions
are concentrated at discrete Lindblad and corotation resonances. Interactions
at principal Lindblad resonances cause the planet's orbit to migrate and open a
gap in the disk if the planet is sufficiently massive. Those at first order
Lindblad and corotation resonances change the planet's orbital eccentricity.
Eccentricity is excited by interactions at external Lindblad resonances which
are located on the opposite side of corotation from the planet, and damped by
co-orbital Lindblad resonances which overlap the planet's orbit. If the planet
clears a gap in the disk, the rate of eccentricity damping by co-orbital
Lindblad resonances is reduced. Density gradients associated with the gap
activate eccentricity damping by corotation resonances at a rate which
initially marginally exceeds that of eccentricity excitation by external
Lindblad resonances. But the corotation torque drives a mass flux which reduces
the density gradient near the resonance. Sufficient partial saturation of
corotation resonances can tip the balance in favor of eccentricity excitation.
A minimal initial eccentricity of a few percent is required to overcome viscous
diffusion which acts to unsaturate corotation resonances by reestablishing the
large scale density gradient. Thus eccentricity growth is a finite amplitude
instability. Formally, interactions at the apsidal resonance, which is a
special kind of co-orbital Lindblad resonance, appears to damp eccentricity
faster than external Lindblad resonances can excite it. However, apsidal waves
have such long wavelengths that they do not propagate in protoplanetary disks.
This reduces eccentricity damping by the apsidal resonance to a modest level.

contributes to the two-point correlation function, such as the angular power
spectrum of convergence or shear. At arcminute scales or above, the second
order contribution to the angular power spectrum of convergence due to source
clustering is below the level of a few percent. The background clustering of
sources also results in a non-Gaussian contribution to the power spectrum
covariance of weak lensing convergence through a four-point correlation
function or a trispectrum in Fourier space. The increase in variance is, at
most, a few percent relative to the Gaussian contribution while the band powers
are also correlated at the few percent level. The non-Gaussian contributions
due to background source clustering is at least an order of magnitude smaller

designed to study the origin of galaxy morphologies in a cold dark
matter-dominated universe. The simulations include star formation and feedback
and have numerical resolution sufficiently high to allow for a direct
investigation of the morphology of simulated galaxies. We find, in agreement
with previous theoretical work, that the presence of the main morphological
components of galaxies--disks, spheroids, bars--is regulated by the mode of gas
accretion and intimately linked to discrete accretion events. In the case we
present, disks arise from the smooth deposition of cooled gas at the center of
dark halos, spheroids result from the stirring of preexisting disks during
mergers, and bars are triggered by tides generated by satellites. This
demonstrates that morphology is a transient phenomenon within the lifetime of a
galaxy and that the Hubble sequence reflects the varied accretion histories of
galaxies in hierarchical formation scenarios. In particular, we demonstrate
directly that disk/bulge systems can be built and rebuilt by the smooth
accretion of gas onto the remnant of a major merger and that the present-day
remnants of late dissipative mergers between disks are spheroidal stellar
systems with structure resembling that of field ellipticals. The perplexing
variety of galaxy morphologies is thus highly suggestive of--and may actually
even demand--a universe where structures have evolved hierarchically.

demonstrate that the SDSS photometric pipeline recovers \about90% of the known
asteroids in the observed region. For the recovered asteroids we find a large
offset (\about 0.4 mag) between Johnson V magnitudes derived from SDSS
photometry and the predicted catalog-based visual magnitudes. This offset
varies with the asteroid color from 0.34 mag for blue asteroids to 0.44 mag for
red asteroids, and is probably caused by the use of unfiltered CCD observations

leads to an overestimate of the number of asteroids brighter than a given

on an astrophysical problem of critical interest to gravitational wave
observers we introduce a model for coalescence radiation from binary black hole
systems. We build our model using the ""Lazarus approach"", a technique that
bridges far and close limit approaches with full numerical relativity to solve
Einstein equations applied in the truly nonlinear dynamical regime. We
specifically study the post-orbital radiation from a system of equal-mass
non-spinning black holes, deriving waveforms which indicate strongly circularly
polarized radiation of roughly 3% of the system's total energy and 12% of its
total angular momentum in just a few cycles. Supporting this result we first
establish the reliability of the late-time part of our model, including the
numerical relativity and close-limit components, with a thorough study of
waveforms from a sequence of black hole configurations varying from previously
treated head-on collisions to representative target for ``ISCO'' data
corresponding to the end of the inspiral period. We then complete our model
with a simple treatment for the early part of the spacetime based on a standard
family of initial data for binary black holes in circular orbit. A detailed
analysis shows strong robustness in the results as the initial separation of
the black holes is increased from 5.0 to 7.8M supporting our waveforms as a
suitable basic description of the astrophysical radiation from this system.
Finally, a simple fitting of the plunge waveforms is introduced as a first
attempt to facilitate the task of analyzing data from gravitational wave
detectors.

ultra-low mass ratio systems such as ER UMa stars and WZ Sge stars, the
superoutburst ends while the disc is still eccentric, as proposed by Hellier
(2001). However, since the disc shrinks rapidly once a cooling wave has
started, the eccentricity should stop shortly after the end of a superoutburst.
This result disagrees with the suggestion by Hellier that decoupling the
thermal and tidal instability in the TTI model can account for late superhumps
and echo outbursts in ultra-low mass ratio systems. We propose instead that ER
UMa short supercycles can be explained either by the alternation of narrow and
wide outbursts similar to those occurring in SS Cyg, or by the effects of
irradiation (Hameury et al. 2000). In both cases, we predict that superhumps
should be permanent, which is suggested by observations (Gao et al. 1999). We
can also reproduce light curves similar to those of EG Cnc, varying the mass
transfer rate in a TTI model including both irradiation and the presence of an
inner hole in the disc.

are no strong deviations from solar abundances. The narrow emission lines from
the O VII and Ne IX forbidden and intercombination lines probably originate
from much larger distances to the black hole. We find evidence for weak
relativistically broadened oxygen and nitrogen emission lines from the inner
parts of the accretion disk, but at a much smaller flux level than those

treatment of the mode coupling, it is found that multimode pulsation with
constant amplitudes is a highly probable solution. An observable consequence of
the m=0 mode excitation is randomness of pulsation amplitude. The case of an
l=1 mode is the most important because of a small averaging effect and a large
excitation probability. A significant amplitude and phase modulation is
predicted in the case of excitation of an l=1,m=+/-1 pair. This may explain
Blazhko-type modulation in RR Lyrae stars. If this model is correct, the

center-filled image in X-ray band, contrasting with the shell-like appearance
in radio and optical bands. The overall X-ray emission is thermal, not from a
synchrotron nebula. ASCA observed IC 443 three times, covering the whole
remnant. From the image analysis, we found that the softness-ratio map reveals
a shell-like structure. At the same time, its spectra require two (1.0 keV and
0.2 keV) plasma components; the emission of the 0.2 keV plasma is stronger in
the region near the shell than the center. These results can be explained by a
simple model that IC 443 has a hot (1.0 keV) interior surrounded by a cool (0.2
keV) outer shell. From the emission measures, we infer that the 0.2 keV plasma
is denser than the 1.0 keV plasma, suggesting pressure equilibrium between the
two. In addition, we found that the ionization temperature of sulfur, obtained
from H-like K$\alpha$ to He-like K$\alpha$ intensity ratio, is 1.5 keV,
significantly higher than the gas temperature of 1.0 keV suggested from the
continuum spectrum. The same can be concluded for silicon. Neither an
additional, hotter plasma component nor a multi-temperature plasma successfully
accounts for this ratio, and we conclude that the 1.0 keV plasma is
overionized. This is the first time that overionized gas has been detected in a
SNR. For the gas to become overionized in the absence of a photoionizing flux,
it must cool faster than the ions recombine. Thermal conduction from the 1.0
keV plasma to the 0.2 keV one could cause the 1.0 keV plasma to become
overionized, which is plausible within an old (3$\times10^4$ yr) SNR.

the dark matter component of the SPH simulation, which allows us to compare the
evolution of galaxies on an object-by-object basis in the two treatments. We
use a ``stripped-down'' version of the semi-analytic model described by Helly
et al. which includes only shock heating and radiative cooling of gas and which
is adjusted to mimic the resolution and other parameters of a comparison SPH
simulation as closely as possible. We compare the total mass of gas that cools
in halos of different mass as a function of redshift as well as the masses and
spatial distribution of individual ``galaxies.'' At redshift z=0, the cooled
gas mass in well-resolved halos agrees remarkably well (to better than ~20%) in
the SPH simulation and stripped-down semi-analytic model. At high redshift,
resolution effects in the simulation become increasingly important and, as a
result, more gas tends to cool in low mass halos in the SPH simulation than in
the semi-analytic model. The cold gas mass function of individual galaxies in
the two treatments at z=0 also agrees very well and, when the effects of
mergers are accounted for, the masses of individual galaxies and their 2-point
correlation functions are also in excellent agreement in the two treatments.
Thus, our comparison confirms and extends the earlier conclusion of Benson et
al. that SPH simulations and semi-analytic models give consistent results for
the evolution of cooling galactic gas.

$\epsilon=1-\gamma$, where $\gamma$ is an exponent characterizing the spectrum
of the bosonic bath--shows that competition between the two couplings can drive
the local-moment fluctuations critical. As a result, two distinct types of
quantum critical point emerge in the Kondo lattice, one being of the usual
spin-density-wave type, the other ``locally critical.'' Near the locally
critical point, the dynamical spin susceptibility exhibits $\omega/T$ scaling
with a fractional exponent. While the spin-density-wave critical point is
Gaussian, the locally critical point is an interacting fixed point at which
long-wavelength and spatially local critical modes coexist. A Ginzburg-Landau
description for the locally critical point is discussed. It is argued that
these results are robust, that local criticality provides a natural description
of the quantum critical behavior seen in a number of heavy-fermion metals, and
that this picture may also be relevant to other strongly correlated metals.

study the transverse (G_t) and longitudinal (G_l) Greens functions in phi^4

series. We have shown that the critical behavior of the Greens (correlation)
functions is consistent with a general scaling hypothesis, where the same
critical exponents, found within the GFD theory, are valid both at T<T_c and
T>T_c. The long-wave limit k->0 has been studied at T<T_c, showing that the
transverse and the longitudinal correlation functions diverge as 1/k in the
power of lambda_t and lambda_l, respectively, where d/2< lambda_t < 2 and
lambda_l = 2 lambda_t - d holds at the spatial dimensionality 2<d<4. It is the
physical solution of our equations, which coincides with the asymptotic
solution at T -> T_c as well as with a non-perturbative renormalization group
(RG) analysis provided in our paper. It is confirmed also by Monte Carlo
simulation. The exponents, as well as the ratio bM^2/a^2 (where M is
magnetization, a and b are the amplitudes of G_t and G_l at k->0) are
universal. The results of the perturbative RG method are reproduced by formally
setting lambda_t=2. Nevertheless, we disprove the conventional statement that
lambda_t=2 is the exact result.

temperature, Tc, in a t-J-U model of electrons moving on a square lattice in
which anisotropic electronic hopping is introduced. The inclusion of such
hopping mimics, in a approximate fashion, a potentially important
characteristic of materials possessing stripelike charge and spin correlations.
For this model we have calculated Tc for singlet pairing using the non
self-consistent Thouless criterion, and find a dramatic enhancement of Tc
induced by hopping anisotropies. Further, the maximum increase in Tc is
obtained when the system is pushed towards the extreme anisotropy limit, that
is, when the hopping of electrons is confined to occur in 1+0^+ dimensions. We
demonstrate that in this limit the increase in Tc, with respect to the
isotropic system, can be of the order of 1000. We have also determined that in
the extreme anisotropy limit the superconducting gap is an equal mixture of s
and d pairing symmetries (two choices of such a combination being s + d and s +
id) owing to the reduced (square to rectangular) symmetry of the system in the
presence of hopping anisotropies. Thus, the presence of d-wave superconducting

of stripes, is not unexpected.

particle in Kerr spacetime are the energy $E$, the axial component of the
angular momentum, $L_{z}$, and Carter's constant $Q$. These parameters are
obtained by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the dynamical problem of
geodesic motion. Employing the action-angle variable formalism, on the other
hand, yields a different set of constants of motion, namely, the fundamental
frequencies $\omega_{r}$, $\omega_{\theta}$ and $\omega_{\phi}$ associated with
the radial, polar and azimuthal components of orbital motion. These
frequencies, naturally, determine the time scales of orbital motion and,
furthermore, the instantaneous gravitational wave spectrum in the adiabatic
approximation. In this article, it is shown that the fundamental frequencies
are geometric invariants and explicit formulas in terms of quadratures are
derived. The numerical evaluation of these formulas in the case of a rapidly
rotating black hole illustrates the behaviour of the fundamental frequencies as
orbital parameters such as the semi-latus rectum $p$, the eccentricity $e$ or
the inclination parameter $\theta_{-}$ are varied. The limiting cases of
circular, equatorial and Keplerian motion are investigated as well and it is

offer the possibility to search for Earth-induced matter effects with very long

anti-neutrinos, depending on the sign of $\Delta m^2$. In a three-generation

neutrinos to muon/tau neutrino oscillations (the mixing angle $\Theta_{13}$).

theories. As a consequence of this coupling of the UV and IR sectors, the
configuration of fields at the zero momentum limit in these theories is a very
singular configuration. We show that the renormalization conditions set at a
particular momentum configuration with a fixed number of zero momenta,
renormalizes the Green's functions for any general momenta only when this
configuration has same set of zero momenta. Therefore only when renormalization
conditions are set at a point where all the external momenta are nonzero, the
quantum theory is renormalizable for all values of nonzero momentum. This
arises as a result of different scaling behaviors of Green's functions with
respect to the UV cutoff ($\Lambda$) for configurations containing different
set of zero momenta. We study this in the noncommutative $\phi^4$ theory and
analyse similar results for the Gross-Neveu model at one loop level. We next
show this general feature using Wilsonian RG of Polchinski in the globally O(N)
symmetric scalar theory and prove the renormalizability of the theory to all
orders with an infrared cutoff. In the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking
(SSB) in noncommutative scalar theory, it is essential to note the different
scaling behaviors of Green's functions with respect to $\Lambda$ for different
set of zero momenta configurations. We show that in the broken phase of the
theory the Ward identities are satisfied to all orders only when one keeps an
infrared regulator by shifting to a nonconstant vacuum.

that the relation between the acceleration rate and vacuum energy density flips
upside down compared to the conventional one. The acceleration rate decreases
with increasing the energy density. The experimentally acceptable rate is
obtained for the energy density larger than (1 TeV)$^4$. The results are stable
under quantum corrections because supersymmetry is broken only on the brane and
stays exact in the bulk of infinite volume extra space. Consistency of 4D
gravity and cosmology on the brane requires the quantum gravity scale to be

singular structure is reminiscent of gravitational collapse. Near the threshold
behavior is characterized by the rapidly increasing negative pressure, which
typically arises in the high density NBI matter. Another feature, shared both
the NBI and gravitating monopoles, is the existence of excited states, which
can be thought of as bound states of monopoles and sphalerons. These are
labeled by the number $N$ of nodes of the Yang-Mills function. Their masses are
greater than the mass of the ground state monopole, and they are expected to be
unstable. The sequence of masses $M_N$ rapidly converges to the mass of the
embedded Abelian solution with constant Higgs. The ratio of the sphaleron size
to that of the monopole grows with decreasing $\beta$, and, at the same time,
both fall down until the solutions cease to exist, again exhibiting collapse to

negative only in a transient regime before equilibration, in correspondence to

Bolzmann-Gibbs thermodynamics does not apply and the system shows non-Gaussian

Similar results have recently been found also in several other nonextensive

also to support the conjecture that a nonexstensive statistical formalism, like
the one proposed by Tsallis, should be applied in such cases. The theoretical
scenario is not completely clear yet, but there are already many strong
theoretical indications suggesting that, it can be wrong to consider the
observation of an experimental negative specific heat as an unique and

within Brueckner approach adopting the charge-dependent Argonne $V_{18}$
two-body force plus a microscopic three-body force based on a meson-exchange
model. The effects on the equation of state of the individual processes giving
rise to the three-body force are explored up to high baryonic density. It is
found that the major role is played by the competition between the strongly
repulsive $(\sigma, \omega)$ exchange term with virtual nucleon-antinucleon
excitation and the large attractive contribution due to $(\sigma, \omega)$
exchange with $N^*(1440)$ resonance excitation. The net result is a repulsive
term which shifts the saturation density corresponding to the only two-body
force much closer to the empirical value, while keeping constant the saturation
energy per particle. The contribution from $(\pi, \rho)$ exchange 3BF is shown
to be attractive and rather small. The analysis of the separate three-body
force contributions allows to make a comparison with the prediction of
Dirac-Brueckner approach which is supposed to incorporate via the {\it dressed}
Dirac spinors the same virtual nucleon-antinucleon excitations as in the
present three-body force. The numerical results suggest that the three-body
force components missing from the Dirac-Brueckner approach are not negligible,
especially at high density. The calculation of the nuclear mean field and the
effective mass shows that the three-body force affects to a limited extent such
properties.

extended to isospin asymmetric nuclear matter. The effects of the three-body
force on the equation of state and on the single-particle properties of nuclear
matter are discussed with a view to possible applications in nuclear physics
and astrophysics. It is shown that, even in the presence of the three-body
force, the empirical parabolic law of the energy per nucleon vs isospin
asymmetry $\beta=(N-Z)/A$ is fulfilled in the whole asymmetry range
$0\le\beta\le 1$ up to high densities. The three-body force provides a strong
enhancement of symmetry energy increasing with the density in good agreement
with relativistic approaches. The Lane's assumption that proton and neutron
mean fields linearly vary vs the isospin parameter is violated at high density
in the presence of the three-body force. Instead the momentum dependence of the
mean fields is rather insensitive to three body force which brings about a
linear isospin deviation of the neutron and proton effective masses. The
isospin effects on multifragmentation events and collective flows in heavy-ion
collisions are briefly discussed along with the conditions for direct URCA

other physicists, as together we've tried to learn some cryptography, but also
from conversations with a couple of classical cryptographers. The main thrust
of the paper is an attempt to explore the ramifications for cryptographic
security of incorporating physics into our thinking at every level. I begin by
discussing two fundamental cryptographic principles, namely that security must
not rely on secrecy of the protocol and that our local environment must be
secure, from a physical perspective. I go on to explain why by definition a
particular cryptographic task, oblivious transfer, is inconsistent with a
belief in the validity of quantum mechanics. More precisely, oblivious transfer
defines states and operations that do not exist in any (complex) Hilbert space.
I go on to argue the fallaciousness of a ""black box"" approach to quantum
cryptography, in which classical cryptographers just trust physicists to
provide them with secure quantum cryptographic sub-protocols, which they then
attempt to incorporate into larger cryptographic systems. Lest quantum
cryptographers begin to feel too smug, I discuss the fact that current
implementations of quantum key distribution are only technologically secure,
and not ""unconditionally"" secure as is sometimes claimed. I next examine the
concept of a secure lab from a physical perspective, and end by making some
observations about the cryptographic significance of the (often overlooked)
necessity for parties who wish to communicate having established physical
reference frames.

For particle energies close to this value, the tunneling rate is not small

After entering inside the barrier, the particle emits electromagnetic quanta
and exits the barrier with a lower energy. The signal amplitude can be much
less compared to the field of the static barrier. This phenomenon can be called
the Euclidean resonance since the under-barrier motion occurs in imaginary
time. The resonance may stimulate chemical and biochemical reactions in a
selective way by adapting the signal to a certain particular chemical bond. The
resonance may be used in search of the soft alpha-decay for which a
conventional observation is impossible due to an extremely small decay rate.

ancestor spin configuration only via a certain parameter related to the energy

  effect",,"PLA 291 (2001) 185-189",,,"quant-ph",,"  We analyze the influence of the finite duration of the measurement on the
quantum Zeno effect, using a simple model of the measurement. It is shown that
the influence of the finite duration of the measurement is uninportant when
this duration is small compared to the duration of the free evolution between
the measurements.

molecules. Such interferometers are particularly suitable for larger masses.
Using three free-standing gold gratings of one micrometer period and a
transversally incoherent but velocity-selected molecular beam, we achieve an
interference fringe visibility of 40 % with high count rate. Both the high
visibility and its velocity dependence are in good agreement with a quantum
simulation that takes into account the van der Waals interaction of the
molecules with the gratings and are in striking contrast to a classical moire
model.
