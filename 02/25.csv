distant Universe by artificially redshifting 101 B-band CCD images of local
spiral galaxies from the Ohio State University Bright Spiral Galaxy Survey. Our
artificially redshifted images correspond to Hubble Space Telescope I-band
observations of the local galaxy sample seen at z=0.7, with integration times
matching those of both the very deep Northern Hubble Deep Field data, and the
much shallower Flanking Field observations. The expected visibility of galactic
bars is probed in two ways: (1) using traditional visual classification, and
(2) by charting the changing shape of the galaxy distribution in ""Hubble
space"", a quantitative two-parameter description of galactic structure that
maps closely on to Hubble's original tuning fork. Both analyses suggest that
over 2/3 of strongly barred luminous local spirals i.e. objects classified as
SB in the Third Reference Catalog) would still be classified as strongly barred
at z=0.7 in the Hubble Deep Field data. Under the same conditions, most weakly
barred spirals (classified SAB in the Third Reference Catalog) would be
classified as regular spirals. The corresponding visibility of spiral structure
is assessed visually, by comparing luminosity classifications for the
artificially redshifted sample with the corresponding luminosity
classifications from the Revised Shapley Ames Catalog. We find that for
exposures times similar to that of the Hubble Deep Field spiral structure
should be detectable in most luminous low-inclination spiral galaxies at z=0.7

two-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations coupled with radiation transport.
The super-Eddington accretion flow with a small viscosity parameter,
  $\alpha = 10^{-3}$, results in a geometrically and optically thick disk with
a large opening angle of $\sim 60^{\circ}$ to the equatorial plane and a very
rarefied, hot, and optically thin high-velocity jets region around the disk.
  The thick accretion flow consists of two different zones: an inner
advection-dominated zone and an outer convection-dominated zone. The
high-velocity region around the disk is divided into two characteristic
regions, a very rarefied funnel region along the rotational axis and a
moderately rarefied high-velocity region outside of the disk. The temperatures
of $\sim 10^7$ K and the densities of $\sim 10^{-7}$ g cm$^{-3}$ in the upper
disk vary sharply to $\sim 10^8$ K and $10^{-8}$ g cm$^{-3}$, respectively,
across the disk boundary between the disk and the high-velocity region. The
X-ray emission of iron lines would be generated only in a confined region
between the funnel wall and the photospheric disk boundary, where flows are
accelerated to relativistic velocities of $\sim$ 0.2 $c$ due to the dominant
radiation-pressure force. The results are discussed regarding the collimation
angle of the jets, the large mass-outflow rate obserevd in SS 433, and the
ADAFs and the CDAFs models.

$\phi$ per plaquett, which may model the underdoped cuprates, with the emphasis
on the particle-hole and parity/chiral symmetries.This model is reduced to the
Dirac fermions in (2+1)D with a mass gap introduced by the antiferromagnetic
(AF) long range order and/or the stripe formation. Without the mass gap, the
Hall constant $R_H$ and the thermopower $S$ obey two-parameter scaling laws,
and show the strong temperature dependence due to the recovery of the
particle-hole symmetry at high temperature. The $x$-dependences of $\sigma_{xx}
(\propto \sqrt{x})$ and $\sigma_{xy}$ (independent of $x$) are in a sharp
contradiction with the experiments. (Here $x$ is the hole concentration.)
Therefore there is no signature of the particle-hole symmetry or the massless
Dirac fermions in the underdoped cuprates even above the Neel temperature
$T_N$. With the mass gap introduced by the AF order, there occurs the parity
anomaly for each of the Dirac fermions. However the contributions from
different valleys and spins cancel with each other to result in no spontaneous
Hall effect even if the time-reversal symmetry is broken with $\phi \ne \pi$.
The effects of the stripes are also studied. The diagonal and vertical
(horizontal) stripes have quite different influence on the transport
properties. The suppression of $R_H$ occurs at low temperature only when (i)
both the AF order and the vertical (horizontal) stripe coexist, and (ii) the
average over the in-plane direction is taken. Discussions on the recent

crosstalk noise to obey the Gaussian distribution. In order to examine our

thermodynamic limit, and quantum phase transition, translate into biological
concepts in mutation-selection models for sequence evolution and can be used
there. The article takes a biological point of view within a population
genetics framework, but contains an appendix for physicists, which makes this
correspondence clear. We analyze the equilibrium behavior of deterministic
haploid mutation-selection models. Both the forward and the time-reversed
evolution processes are considered. The stationary state of the latter is
called the ancestral distribution, which turns out as a key for the study of
mutation-selection balance. We find that it determines the sensitivity of the
equilibrium mean fitness to changes in the fitness values and discuss
implications for the evolution of mutational robustness. We further show that
the difference between the ancestral and the population mean fitness, termed
mutational loss, provides a measure for the sensitivity of the equilibrium mean
fitness to changes in the mutation rate. For a class of models in which the
number of mutations in an individual is taken as the trait value, and fitness
is a function of the trait, we use the ancestor formulation to derive a simple
maximum principle, from which the mean and variance of fitness and the trait
may be derived; the results are exact for a number of limiting cases, and
otherwise yield approximations which are accurate for a wide range of
parameters. These results are applied to (error) threshold phenomena caused by
the interplay of selection and mutation. They lead to a clarification of
concepts, as well as criteria for the existence of thresholds.

to this approximate conservation of pseudo-momentum, a certain fraction of the

emerges in the optical conductivity. We develop simple criteria to determine
under what conditions approximate pseudo-momentum conservation is relevant and
calculate within in Fermi liquid theory the weights of the corresponding

studies focused on removing the anisotropy. Here we introduce a new universal
set of quantum logic gates that takes advantage of the anisotropic
perturbation. The price is a constant but modest factor in additional pulses.
The gain is a scheme that is compatible with the naturally available
interactions in spin-based solid-state quantum computers.

"quant-ph/0202136","Dominic William Berry","Dominic Berry","Adaptive Phase Measurements","PhD thesis, 228 pages, 103 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In this thesis I consider the general problem of how to make the best
possible phase measurements using feedback. Both the optimum input state and
optimum feedback are considered for both single-mode dyne measurements and
two-mode interferometric measurements. I derive the optimum input states under
general dyne measurements when the mean photon number is fixed, both for
general states and squeezed states. I propose a new feedback scheme that
introduces far less phase uncertainty than mark II feedback, and is very close
to the theoretical limit. I also derive results for the phase variance when
there is a time delay in the feedback loop, showing that there is a lower limit
to the introduced phase variance, and this is approached quite accurately under
some conditions. I derive the optimum input states for interferometry, showing
that the phase uncertainty scales as 1/N for all the common measures of
uncertainty. This is contrasted with the |j0>_z state, which does not scale as
1/N for all measures of phase uncertainty. I introduce an adaptive feedback
scheme that is very close to optimum, and can give scaling very close to 1/N
for the uncertainty. Lastly I consider the case of continuous measurements, for
both the dyne and interferometric cases.

mechanics by investigating analytical examples where the creation or
annihilation of vortices occurs. In classical hydrodynamics of non-viscous
fluids the Helmholtz-Kelvin theorem ensures that the velocity field circulation
is conserved. We discuss applicability of the theorem in the hydrodynamical
formulation of quantum mechanics showing that the assumptions of the theorem
may be broken in quantum evolution of the wavefunction leading to a change of
the topological charge.
