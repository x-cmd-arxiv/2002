inflationary cosmology, focussing on the required accuracy of the initial power
spectra. Parametrizing the spectra, for example by power-laws, is well suited
to testing the inflationary paradigm but will only correctly estimate
cosmological parameters if the parametrization is sufficiently accurate, and we
investigate conditions under which this is achieved both for present data and
for upcoming satellite data. If inflation is favoured, reliable estimation of
its physical parameters requires an alternative approach adopting its detailed
predictions. For slow-roll inflation, we investigate the accuracy of the
predicted spectra at first and second order in the slow-roll expansion
(presenting the complete second-order corrections for the tensors for the first
time). We find that within the presently-allowed parameter space, there are
regions where it will be necessary to include second-order corrections to reach
the accuracy requirements of MAP and Planck satellite data. We end by proposing
a data analysis pipeline appropriate for testing inflation and for cosmological
parameter estimation from high-precision data.

The four sources with the highest redshifts are detected at 850 microns, with

most of their mass by accretion, accounting for the observed demography of

explaining the observed one, and we show that this deficit can be removed by
taking into account (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies (ULIGs/LIGs) with a

designed to fairly sample the variety of galaxy morphologies and environments

correlations between Tully-Fisher residuals and both B-R color and EW(Halpha).
The extremes of the correlations are populated by Sa galaxies, which show
consistently red colors, and spirals with morphological peculiarities, which
are often blue. If we apply an EW(Halpha)-dependent or B-R color-dependent
correction term to the Tully-Fisher relation, the scatter in the relation no
longer increases from R to B to U but instead drops to a nearly constant level
close to the scatter we expect from measurement errors. We argue that these
results probably reflect correlated offsets in luminosity and color as a
function of star formation history. Broadening the sample in morphology and
luminosity, we find that most non-spirals brighter than M_R^i=-18 follow the
same correlations as do spirals, albeit with greater scatter. However, the
color and EW(Halpha) correlations do not apply to galaxies fainter than
M_R^i=-18 or to emission-line S0 galaxies with anomalous gas kinematics. For
the dwarf galaxy population, the parameters controlling Tully-Fisher residuals
are instead related to the degree of recent disturbance: overluminous dwarfs
have higher rotation curve asymmetries, brighter U-band effective surface
brightnesses, and shorter gas consumption timescales than their underluminous
counterparts. As a result, sample selection strongly affects the measured
faint-end slope of the Tully-Fisher relation. Passively evolving, rotationally
supported galaxies display a break toward steeper slope at low luminosities.

passive methods that are applied on a single telescope to overcome atmospheric
image degradation such as speckle interferometry, and various other techniques.
These topics include differential speckle interferometry, speckle spectroscopy

phase-closure methods, dark speckle imaging, as well as the limitations imposed
by the detectors on the performance of speckle imaging. A brief account is
given of the technological innovation of adaptive-optics (AO) to compensate
such atmospheric effects on the image in real time. A major advancement
involves the transition from single-aperture to the dilute-aperture
interferometry using multiple telescopes. Therefore, the review deals with
recent developments involving ground-based, and space-based optical arrays.
Emphasis is placed on the problems specific to delay-lines, beam recombination,
polarization, dispersion, fringe-tracking, bootstrapping, coherencing and
cophasing, and recovery of the visibility functions. The role of AO in
enhancing visibilities is also discussed. The applications of interferometry,
such as imaging, astrometry, and nulling are described. The mathematical
intricacies of the various `post-detection' image-processing techniques are
examined critically. The review concludes with a discussion of the

Starting from an empty lattice the binding dynamics goes, quite generally,
through several stages. The first stage represents fast initial binding closely
resembling the physics of random sequential adsorption processes. Typically
this initial process leaves the system in a metastable locked state with many
small gaps between blocks of bound molecules. In a second stage the gaps
annihilate slowly as the ligands detach and reattach. This results in an
algebraic decay of the gap concentration and interesting scaling behavior. Upon
identifying the gaps with particles we show that the dynamics in this regime
can be explained by mapping it onto various reaction-diffusion models. The
final approach to equilibrium shows some interesting dynamic scaling
properties. We also discuss the effect of cooperativity on the equilibrium
stoichiometry, and their consequences for the interpretation of biochemical and
image reconstruction results.

ordering processes are obtained analytically in the large $N$ model through the

$\chi_{ag}(t,t_w)$ is found to obey a pattern of behavior, under variation of
dimensionality, qualitatively similar to the one observed in Ising systems.
There exists a critical dimensionality $(d=4)$ above which $\chi_{ag}(t,t_w)$
is proportional to the defect density $\rho_D(t)$, while for $d<4$ it vanishes
more slowly than $\rho_D(t)$ and at $d=2$ does not vanish. As in the Ising
case, this behavior can be understood in terms of the dependence on
dimensionality of the interplay between the defect density and the effective
response associated to a single defect.

of particular interest. Because bio-economic systems are intrinsically complex,
previous efforts in this field have relied on a variety of simplifying

Problems of tractability are surmounted by using the methodology of qualitative
differential equations (QDE). The theory of QDEs takes into account that
scientific knowledge about particular fisheries is usually limited, and
facilitates an analysis of the global dynamics of systems with more than two
ordinary differential equations. The model is able to trace the evolution of
capital and fish stock in good agreement with observed patterns, and shows that
over-capitalization is unavoidable in unregulated fisheries.

local observers in either metric spacetimes, while maintaining diffeomorphism
invariance. When the metric g_{\mu\nu} is chosen to be associated with comoving
coordinates, then the speed of light varies in the frame with the metric {\hat
g}_{\mu\nu}. Observers in this frame see the dimming of supernovae because of
the increase of the luminosity distance versus red shift, due to an increasing
speed of light in the early universe. Moreover, in this frame the scalar field
\phi describes a dark energy component in the Friedmann equation for the cosmic
scale without acceleration. If we choose {\hat g}_{\mu\nu} to be associated
with comoving coordinates, then an observer in the g_{\mu\nu} metric frame will
observe the universe to be accelerating and the supernovae will appear to be
farther away. The theory predicts that the gravitational constant G can vary in
spacetime, while the fine-structure constant \alpha=e^2/\hbar c does not vary.

problem of the emission of gravitational waves by isolated systems in the
context of general relativity. Part A of the article deals with general
post-Newtonian sources. The exterior field of the source is investigated by
means of a combination of analytic post-Minkowskian and multipolar
approximations. The physical observables in the far-zone of the source are
described by a specific set of radiative multipole moments. By matching the
exterior solution to the metric of the post-Newtonian source in the near-zone
we obtain the explicit expressions of the source multipole moments. The
relationships between the radiative and source moments involve many non-linear
multipole interactions, among them those associated with the tails (and
tails-of-tails) of gravitational waves. Part B of the article is devoted to the
application to compact binary systems. We present the equations of binary
motion, and the associated Lagrangian and Hamiltonian, at the third
post-Newtonian (3PN) order beyond the Newtonian acceleration. The
gravitational-wave energy flux, taking consistently into account the
relativistic corrections in the binary moments as well as the various tail
effects, is derived through 3.5PN order with respect to the quadrupole
formalism. The binary's orbital phase, whose prior knowledge is crucial for
searching and analyzing the signals from inspiralling compact binaries, is
deduced from an energy balance argument.

defects are formed, their number density is determined by the shortest unstable

amplify the inhomogeneities in the energy density, leading to local symmetry
restoration and faster thermalization. We believe this explains why tachyonic
preheating is so effective in transferring energy away from the inflaton zero
mode.

magnetic monopole confining and condensate phases in the Topological Quantum
Field Theory are identified with the extended (energy bands) and localized
(gaps) phases of the Bloch electron. The magnetic monopole condensate is
associated, at the nonrelativistic level, with gravitational white holes due to
deformed classical gauge fields. These gravitational solutions render the
existence of finite energy pure magnetic monopoles possible. This mechanism
constitutes a dynamical symmetry breaking which regularizes the solutions on
those localized phases allowing physical solutions of the Shr\""odinger equation
which are chains of electron filaments connecting several monopole-white
holes.To test these results would be necessary a strong external magnetic field
$B\sim 5 T$ at low temperature $T<1 K$. To be accomplished, it would test the

M.C.McCord introduced a construction that can be interpreted as a model for the
categorical tensor product of a based space and a topological abelian group.
This can be adapted to Segal's very special Gamma--spaces, and then to a more
modern situation: (K tensor R) where K is a based space and R is a unital,
augmented, commutative, associative S--algebra.
  The model comes with an easy-to-describe filtration. If one lets K = S^n, and
then stabilize with respect to n, one gets a filtered model for the Topological
Andre--Quillen Homology of R. When R = Omega^{infty} Sigma^{infty} X, one
arrives at a filtered model for the connective cover of a spectrum X,
constructed from its 0th space.
  Another example comes by letting K be a finite complex, and R the S--dual of
a finite complex Z. Dualizing again, one arrives at G.Arone's model for the
Goodwillie tower of the functor sending Z to the suspension spectrum of
Map(K,Z).
  Applying cohomology with field coefficients, one gets various spectral
sequences for deloopings with known E_1--terms. A few nontrivial examples are
given.
  In an appendix, we describe the construction for unital, commutative,
associative S--algebras not necessarily augmented.

as a simple model non-linear partial differential equation to show some
essential functions of its non-linear term and its consequences, which, we
believe, are shared with other non-linear partial differential equations. We
show that solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations above their
critical parameters may be linearly stable, but are nonlinearly unstable. No
stable solution exists above the critical parameter, contrary to the prediction
of the linear-stability analysis. This is because a linearly stable disturbance
can transfer energy simultaneously, not necessarily in cascade from small wave
numbers to large wave numbers. An initial disturbance can breed its entire
harmonics simultaneously. Second, I show that a long-time numerical chaotic

conservation contributes to the reaction plane resolution. Momentum
conservation mostly affects the first harmonic in azimuthal distributions,
i.e., directed flow. It also modifies higher harmonics, for instance elliptic
flow, when they are measured with respect to a first harmonic event plane such
as one determined with the standard transverse momentum method. Our method is
illustrated by application to NA49 data on pion directed flow.

10^{4} V/cm $ and of the CH$_{4}$ concentration $x$ up to $x \approx 10 % ,$ at
temperatures $T\approx 130 K,$ fairly close to the normal boiling point of Kr
$(T_{b}\approx 120 K)$(folegani). We present here new data which extend the
previous set in the region of low electric field. The experimental results are
interpreted in terms of a kinetic model previously proposed to explain the
concentration dependent behavior of $\mu$ in liquid Ar--Kr and Ar--Xe mixtures.
The main result is that CH$_{4}$ is more effective in enhancing
energy--transfer rather than momentum--transfer in comparison with mixtures of
liquified noble gases. The field dependence of $\mu$ is quite complicate. In
particular, at intermediate values of the field, there appears to be a
crossover between two different electric--field dependent behaviors of $\mu.$
The electric field strength at crossover is well correlated with the
concentration of CH$_{4}.$ This fact suggests that different excitations of the
molecular solute might be involved in the momentum-- and energy--transfer
processes for different values of the mean electron energy.
