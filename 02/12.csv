highest redshift quasars do not appear to be any different from their lower

for ""weak homology"", useful for the interpretation of the Fundamental Plane of

between the two populations in hard X-ray flux and near IR brightness. These

ellipticals, NGC 1399 has the strongest known ``UV upturn'' -- a sharp spectral
rise shortward of 2500 A. It is now well-established that this emission comes
from hot horizontal branch (HB) stars and their progeny; however, the chemical
composition of these stars has been the subject of a long-standing debate. For
the first time in observations of any elliptical galaxy, our spectra clearly
show photospheric metallic absorption lines within the UV upturn. The abundance
of N is at 45% solar, Si is at 13% solar, and C is at 2% solar. Such abundance
anomalies are a natural consequence of gravitational diffusion. These
photospheric abundances fall in the range observed for subdwarf B stars of the

  The star is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of
3.10575 d and an eccentricity of 0.352. Weak pulsational signals are found in
both the radial velocity and line-profile variations, allowing us to show that
the two highest-amplitude Gamma Doradus pulsation modes are consistent with l=1

light variations, one in the Delta Scuti regime and nine in the Gamma Doradus
domain. Five of the Gamma Doradus frequencies are exact integer multiples of
the orbital frequency. This observation leads us to suspect they are tidally
excited. Results of theoretical modeling (stability analysis, tidal excitation)
were consistent with the observations.

use our HI-selected sample to predict the properties of the absorption line
systems. We use measurements of the number density and HI cross-section of
galaxies to show that the total HI cross-section at column densities sufficient
to produce damped Lyman-alpha absorption is consistent with no evolution of the
absorber population. We also find that the dN/dz distribution is dominated by
galaxies with HI masses near 10^9 Msolar. However, because of the large
dispersion in the correlation between HI mass and stellar luminosity, we find
that the distribution of dN/dz as a function of L_J is fairly flat.
Additionally, we examine the line widths of the HI-selected galaxies and show
that there may be evolution in the kinematics of HI-rich galaxies, but it is
not necessary for the higher redshift population to contain a greater
proportion of high mass galaxies than we find locally.

cosmological variation of the fine structure constant as an effect of the
quantum vacuum, assuming a flat universe with cosmological constant $\Lambda$
in the cases ($\Omega_M, \Omega_\Lambda$) equal to (0.3,0.7) and (1,0). Because
of the fourth Heisenberg relation, the lifetime of the virtual pairs of the
zero-point radiation must depend on the gravitational potential, so that the
quantum vacuum changes its density and acquires a relative permittivity
different from one. Since the matter was more concentrated in the past, the
gravitational potential of all the universe was stronger and the optical
density of the vacuum higher, the electron charge being then more renormalized
and smaller than now. The model is based on a first order Newtonian
approximation that is valid for the range of the observations, but not for very
high redshift, its prediction being that $\Delta \alpha /\alpha$ is
proportional to $\Omega_M[a(t)^{-1}-1]-2\Omega_\Lambda [a(t)^2-1]$, $a(t)$

given to the impact of disordered threshold values on limit-cycle diversity and
limit-cycle complexity in RSANNs which have `normal' thresholds by default.
Surprisingly, RSANNs exhibit only a small repertoire of rather complex
limit-cycle patterns when all parameters are fixed. This repertoire of complex
patterns is also rather stable with respect to small parameter changes. These
two unexpected results may generalize to the study of other complex systems. In
order to reach beyond this seemingly-disabling `stable and small' aspect of the
limit-cycle repertoire of RSANNs, we have found that if an RSANN has threshold
disorder above a critical level, then there is a rapid increase of the size of
the repertoire of patterns. The repertoire size initially follows a power-law
function of the magnitude of the threshold disorder. As the disorder increases
further, the limit-cycle patterns themselves become simpler until at a second
critical level most of the limit cycles become simple fixed points.
Nonetheless, for moderate changes in the threshold parameters, RSANNs are found
to display specific features of behavior desired for rapidly-responding
processing systems: accessibility to a large set of complex patterns.

3-blocks. A 3-block is a graph that cannot be separated into disconnected
subgraphs by cutting the graph at 2 or fewer vertices. Clusters, blobs, and
3-blocks are special cases of $k$-blocks with $k=1$, 2, and 3, respectively. We
study bond percolation clusters at the percolation threshold on 2-dimensional
square lattices and 3-dimensional cubic lattices and, using Monte-Carlo
simulations, determine the distribution of the sizes of the 3-blocks into which
the blobs are decomposed. We find that the 3-blocks have fractal dimension
$d_3=1.2\pm 0.1$ in 2D and $1.15\pm 0.1$ in 3D. These fractal dimensions are
significantly smaller than the fractal dimensions of the blobs, making possible
more efficient calculation of percolation properties. Additionally, the
closeness of the estimated values for $d_3$ in 2D and 3D is consistent with the
possibility that $d_3$ is dimension independent. Generalizing the concept of
the backbone, we introduce the concept of a ``$k$-bone'', which is the set of
all points in a percolation system connected to $k$ disjoint terminal points
(or sets of disjoint terminal points) by $k$ disjoint paths. We argue that the
fractal dimension of a $k$-bone is equal to the fractal dimension of
$k$-blocks, allowing us to discuss the relation between the fractal dimension

  Nonlinear Systems","17 pages, 2 figures",,,,"math.OC",,"  In previous work the notion of input to state stability (ISS) has been
generalized to systems with outputs, yielding a number of useful concepts. When
considering a system whose output is to be kept small (i.e. an error output),
the notion of input to output stability (IOS) arises. Alternatively, when
considering a system whose output is meant to provide information about the
state (i.e. a measurement output), one arrives at the detectability notion of
output to state stability (OSS). Combining these concepts, one may consider a
system with two outputs, an error and a measurement. This leads naturally to a
notion of partial detectability we call measurement to error stability (MES).
This property characterizes systems in which the error signal is detectable
through the measurement signal.
  This paper provides a partial Lyapunov characterization of the MES property.
A closely related property of stability in three measures (SIT) is introduced,
which characterizes systems for which the error decays whenever it dominates
the measurement. The SIT property is shown to imply MES, and the two are shown
to be equivalent under an additional boundedness assumption. A nonsmooth
Lyapunov characterization of the SIT property is provided, which yields the
partial characterization of MES. The analysis is carried out on systems
described by differential inclusions -- implicitly incorporating a disturbance
input with compact value-set.

  The pi0 pi0 Lambda Dalitz plots are strikingly similar to the ones for pi0
pi0 n except that the island is concentrated at m(pi Lambda) ~= 1.38 GeV and
has a narrower width, Gamma ~= 0.05 GeV. This indicates the dominant role of
the Sigma0(1385)(3/2+) resonance. The similarity in the Dalitz plots and the
proportionality of the total cross sections are an impressive testimony of the
applicability of broken SU(3) flavor symmetry to reaction dynamics. We have
measured sigma(tot)(K- p -> pi0 pi0 Lambda) ~= 6sigma(tot)(K- p -> pi0 pi0

different. The Dalitz plots for pi0 pi0 Sigma0 show some enhancement at low pi0
pi0 invariant mass, and there is good indication for the Lambda(1405)

  An alternative is considered here: a probabilistic theory of hidden variables
underlying quantum mechanics could be statistically local, in the sense that it
supplies global configuration probabilities which are defined by expressions
involving only local terms. This allows Bell correlations without relying on
{\it either} a conspiracy theory in which prior common causes correlate the
system state with experimenters' choices {\it or} a reverse causation principle
in which experimenters' choices affect the earlier system states. In
particular, there is no violation of the free will criterion. It gives a
different perspective on Bell correlations, in which the puzzle is not that
