The SA technique has systematic uncertainties arising from the simplified

substantial systematic variations in the galaxy masses it predicts.
Nevertheless, for the best current SPH methods and the standard assumptions of

Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data as a bright point source with nonstellar colors.
Subsequent SDSS imaging and spectroscopy showed that the point source declined
or disappeared, revealing an underlying host galaxy at redshift 0.385. Based on
these properties, the source was suggested to be a candidate ``orphan
afterglow'': a moderately beamed optical transient, associated with a gamma-ray
burst (GRB) whose highly beamed radiation cone does not include our line of
sight. We present new imaging and spectroscopic observations of this source.
When combined with a careful re-analysis of archival optical and radio data,
the observations prove that SDSS J124602.54+011318.8 is in fact an unusual
radio-loud AGN, probably in the BL Lac class. The object displays strong
photometric variability on time scales of weeks to years, including several
bright flares, similar to the one initially reported. The SDSS observations are
therefore almost certainly not related to a GRB. The optical spectrum of this
object dramatically changes in correlation with its optical brightness. At the
bright phase, weak, narrow oxygen emission lines and probably a broader
H$\alpha$ line are superposed on a blue continuum. As the flux decreases, the
spectrum becomes dominated by the host galaxy light, with emerging stellar
absorption lines, while both the narrow and broad emission lines have larger
equivalent widths. We briefly discuss the implications of this discovery on the
study of AGNs and other optically variable or transient phenomena.

proportional to Omega_m^{0.6}, and halo clustering at fixed M/M_* is unchanged.
If one simultaneously changes the P(k) amplitude sigma_8 to maintain a ""cluster

approximately constant near M ~ 5e14 Msun, and halo clustering and pairwise

decrease of Omega_m from 0.3 to 0.2 producing a ~30% drop in the number of low
mass halos. One can preserve the shape of n(M) over a large dynamic range by
changing the shape of P(k), but the required changes are substantial, and they
significantly alter the halo clustering and halo velocities. The sensitivity of
the dark halo population to cosmological model parameters has encouraging
implications for efforts to constrain cosmology and galaxy bias with observed
galaxy clustering, since the predicted changes in the halo population cannot
easily be masked by altering the way that galaxies occupy halos. A shift in
Omega_m alone would be detected by any dynamically sensitive clustering
statistic; a cluster normalized change to sigma_8 and Omega_m would require a
change in galaxy occupation as a function of M/M_*, which would alter galaxy
clustering; and a simultaneous change to P(k) that preserves the halo mass
function would change the clustering of the halos themselves.

can extract energy and angular momentum from the black hole and transfer them
to the disk if the black hole rotates faster than the disk. The energy can be
dissipated and radiated away by the disk, which makes the disk shine without
the need of accretion. In this paper we present a toy model for the magnetic
connection: a single electric current flowing around a Kerr black hole in the
equatorial plane generates a poloidal magnetic field which connects the black
hole to the disk. The rotation of the black hole relative to the disk generates
an electromotive force which in turn generates a poloidal electric current
flowing through the black hole and the disk and produces a power on the disk.
We will consider two cases: (1) The toroidal current flows on the inner
boundary of the disk, which generates a poloidal magnetic field connecting the
horizon of the black hole to a region of the disk {\it beyond} the inner
boundary; (2) The toroidal current flows on a circle inside the inner boundary
of the disk but outside the horizon of the black hole, which generates a
poloidal magnetic field connecting a portion of the horizon of the black hole
to the {\it whole} disk. We will calculate the power produced by the magnetic
connection and the resulting radiation flux of the disk in the absence of
accretion, and compare them with that produced by accretion.

according to the source luminosity. By inferring the source physical parameters
through (necessarily) modeling the blazar spectra, we have previously proposed
that the sequence arises because the particles responsible for most of the
emission suffer increasing radiative losses as the luminosity increases. Here
we extend those results by considering the widest possible range of blazar
spectral properties. We find a new important ingredient for shaping the spectra
of the lowest power objects, namely the role of a finite timescale for the
injection of relativistic particles. Only high energy particles radiatively
cool in such timescale leading to a break in the particle distribution:
particles with this break energy are those emitting most of the power, and this
gives raise to a link between blazar spectra and total energy density inside
the source, which controls the cooling timescale. The emerging picture requires
two phases for the particle acceleration: a first pre-heating phase in which
particles reach a characteristic energy as the result of balancing heating and
radiative cooling, and a more rapid acceleration phase which further accelerate
these particles to form a power law distribution. While in agreement with
standard shock theory, this scenario also agrees with the idea that the
luminosity of blazars is produced through internal shocks, which naturally lead
to shocks lasting for a finite time.

Agreement between the results of the two methods is satisfactory for all major

produce a high abundance of atomic deuterium, which then accretes onto grain
surfaces, diffusive surface chemistry can produce large abundances of
deuterated species, especially at low temperatures and high gas densities.
Warming temperatures will then permit these surface species to evaporate into

the specific angular momentum of accreted material indicate that quite small

$g_{a}(\beta)$, was obtained. The pressure dependence of $g_{a}(\beta)$ is
markedly different from that for the pure superfluid, $g_{0}(\beta)$, which
diverges at a polycritical pressure of 21 bars. We compare our results with
calculations from the homogeneous scattering model for $g_{a}(\beta)$, defined

reduced by the suppression of the superfluid transition temperature. The

solid dramatically modifies its low-energy electron and phonon dynamics from
that of a bulk crystal. However, nanocrystals are usually coupled--even if only
weakly--to an environment consisting of other nanocrystals, a support matrix,
or a solid substrate, and this environmental interaction will modify the
vibrational properties at low frequencies. In this paper we investigate the
modification of the vibrational modes of an insulating spherical nanoparticle
caused by a weak {\it mechanical} coupling to a semi-infinite substrate. The
phonons of the bulk substrate act as a bath of harmonic oscillators, and the
coupling to this reservoir shifts and broadens the nanoparticle's modes. The
vibrational density of states in the nanoparticle is obtained by solving the
Dyson equation for the phonon propagator, and we show that environmental
interaction is especially important at low frequencies. As a probe of the
modified phonon spectrum, we consider nonradiative energy relaxation of a

data shows the chloride concentrations in rainfall to have a white noise
spectrum, while in streamflow, the spectrum exhibits a fractal $1/f$ scaling.
The empirically derived distribution of tracer travel times $h(t)$ follows a
power-law, indicating low-level contaminant delivery to streams for a very long
time. Our transport model is based on a continuous time random walk (CTRW) with
an event time distribution governed by $\psi(t)\sim A_{\beta}t^{-1-\beta}$. The
CTRW using this power-law $\psi(t)$ (with $0<\beta<1$) is interchangeable with
the time-fractional advection-dispersion equation (FADE) and has accounted for
the universal phenomenon of anomalous transport in a broad range of disordered
and complex systems. In the current application, the events can be realized as
transit times on portions of the catchment network. The travel time
distribution is the first passage time distribution $F(t; l)$ at a distance $l$
from a pulse input (at $t=0$) at the origin. We show that the empirical $h(t)$
is the catchment areal composite of $F(t; l)$ and that the fractal $1/f$
spectral response found in many catchments is an example of the larger class of
transport phenomena cited above. The physical basis of $\psi(t)$, which
determines $F(t; l)$, is the origin of the extremely long chemical retention
times in catchments.

on accounting for the appearance of non-Fickian (anomalous) transport behavior.

continuous time random walk (CTRW) and reduces to the conventional forms of the
advection-dispersion equation (ADE) under highly restrictive conditions.
Fractional derivative formulations of the transport equations, both temporal

this context of L{\'e}vy flights is critically examined. In order to determine
chemical transport in field-scale situations, the CTRW approach is generalized

computer simulation, because the (longest) relaxation times increase by about
15 decades upon approaching the transition temperature T_g. Brute-force
molecular dynamics simulations, as presented here for molten SiO_2 and
coarse-grained bead-spring models of polymer chains, can yield very useful
insight about the first few decades of this slowing down. Hence this allows to
access the temperature range around T_c of the so-called mode coupling theory,
whereas the dynamics around the experimental glass transition is completely out
of reach. While methods such as ``parallel tempering'' improve the situation
somewhat, a method that allows to span a significant part of the region T_g\leq
T\leq T_c is still lacking. Only for abstract models such as the infinite range
10-state Potts glass with a few hundred spins this region can be explored.
However this model suffers from very strong finite size effects thus making it
difficult to extrapolate the results obtained for the finite system sizes to
the thermodynamic limit. For the case of polymer melts, two different
strategies to use lattice models instead of continuum models are discussed: In
the first approach, a mapping of an atomistically realistic model of
polyethylene to the bond fluctuation model with suitable effective potentials
and a temperature-dependent time rescaling factor is attempted. In the second
approach, devoted to a test of the entropy theory, moves that are artificial
but which lead to a faster relaxation (``slithering snake'' algorithm) are
used, to get at least static properties at somewhat lower temperatures than
possible with a ``realistic'' dynamics. The merits and shortcomings of all
these approaches are discussed.

after some fixed time span $\Delta t$, say one week or one year. This measures
how well (or how bad) the asset performs over that given period of time. It has
been established that the distribution of returns exhibits ``fat tails''
indicating that large returns occur more frequently than what is expected from
standard Gaussian stochastic processes (Mandelbrot-1967,Stanley1,Doyne).
Instead of estimating this ``fat tail'' distribution of returns, we propose
here an alternative approach, which is outlined by addressing the following
question: What is the smallest time interval needed for an asset to cross a
fixed return level of say 10%? For a particular asset, we refer to this time as
the {\it investment horizon} and the corresponding distribution as the {\it
investment horizon distribution}. This latter distribution complements that of
returns and provides new and possibly crucial information for portfolio design
and risk-management, as well as for pricing of more exotic options. By
considering historical financial data, exemplified by the Dow Jones Industrial

theory to a classical macroscopic dynamics during the initial stage of fusion
reactions. We show that TDHF (Time-dependent Hartree-Fock) could be a useful
tool to gain information on fusion barriers as well as on one-body dissipation
effects. We apply the mean-field theory to the case of head-on reaction between
$^{16}$O and $^{16,22,24,28}$O in order to quantify the effect of neutron skin
on fusion. We show that the determination of fusion barrier requires, in
addition to a precise knowledge of the relative distance between the center of
mass of the two fusing nuclei, the introduction of an additional collective
coordinate that explicitly breaks the neutron-proton symmetry. In this context,
we estimate the position, height and diffuseness of the barrier as well as the
one-body friction and show that a global enhancement of the fusion
cross-section is expected in neutron rich nuclei.

because of the complexity of the classical plasma, index of refraction at

based on the data from the global GPS system available through the Internet. It
was shown that the number of GPS phase slips increases with the increasing
level of disturbance and that there is a good correlation between the rate of
Dst-variation and the frequency of slips. It was further shown that the
relative frequency of slips has also a clearly pronounced aspect dependence.
Phase slips of the GPS signal can be caused by the scattering from small-scale
irregularities of the ionospheric E-layer. Phase slip characteristics are
indicative of Farley-Buneman instabilities as a plausible physical mechanism
that is responsible for the formation of geomagnetic field-aligned
irregularities. Using simultaneous measurements of backscatter signal
characteristics from the Irkutsk incoherent scatter radar and existing models
for such irregularities, we estimated the order of magnitude of the expected

be viewed as the basic pieces for understanding the multilayer behavior.
Additionally, we introduce a simple trace criterion that allows us to classify
multilayers in three types with properties closely related to one (and only

which vanish on product probability distributions, and which can only decrease
if the parties carry out local operations or carry out public classical
communication. These ``secrecy monotones'' therefore measure how much secret
correlations are shared by the parties. In the bipartite case we show that the
mutual information is a secrecy monotone. In the multipartite case we describe
two different generalisations of the mutual information, both of which are
secrecy monotones. The existence of two distinct secrecy monotones allows us to
show that in multipartite quantum cryptography the parties must make
irreversible choices about which multipartite correlations they want to obtain.
Secrecy monotones can be extended to the quantum domain and are then defined on
density matrices. We illustrate this generalisation by considering tri-partite
quantum cryptography based on the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. We
show that before carrying out measurements on the state, the parties must make
an irreversible decision about what probability distribution they want to
