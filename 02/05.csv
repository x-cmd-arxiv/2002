an XMM-Newton observation of the PSR J0631+1035 field, along with a re-analysis

energy (or quintessence). Within the framework of quantum field theory, the
vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor formally diverges as
$k^4$. A cutoff at the Planck or electroweak scale leads to a cosmological
constant which is, respectively, $10^{123}$ or $10^{55}$ times larger than the
observed value, $\l/8\pi G \simeq 10^{-47}$ GeV$^4$. The absence of a
fundamental symmetry which could set the value of $\l$ to either zero or a very
small value leads to {\em the cosmological constant problem}. Most cosmological
scenario's favour a large time-dependent $\l$-term in the past (in order to
generate inflation at $z \gg 10^{10}$), and a small $\l$-term today, to account
for the current acceleration of the universe at $z \lleq 1$. Constraints
arising from cosmological nucleosynthesis, CMB and structure formation
constrain $\l$ to be sub-dominant during most of the intermediate epoch
$10^{10} < z < 1$. This leads to the {\em cosmic coincidence} conundrum which
suggests that the acceleration of the universe is a recent phenomenon and that
we live during a special epoch when the density in $\l$ and in matter are
almost equal. Time varying models of dark energy can, to a certain extent,
ameliorate the fine tuning problem (faced by $\l$), but do not resolve the
puzzle of cosmic coincidence. I briefly review tracker models of dark energy,
as well as more recent brane inspired ideas and the issue of horizons in an
accelerating universe. Model independent methods which reconstruct the cosmic
equation of state from supernova observations are also assessed. Finally, a new
diagnostic of dark energy -- `Statefinder', is discussed.

We first show that the timescale for ohmic decay in the liquid interior is 8 to
12 billion years for a dipole field, and 4 to 6 billion years for a quadrupole
field. We then compare the timescales for ohmic diffusion and accretion at
different depths in the star, and for a simplified field structure and
spherical accretion, calculate the time-dependent evolution of the global
magnetic field at different accretion rates. In this paper, we neglect mass
loss by classical nova explosions and assume the white dwarf mass increases
with time. In this case, the field structure in the outer layers of the white
dwarf is significantly modified for accretion rates above the critical rate
(1-5) x 10^(-10) solar masses per year. We consider the implications of our
results for observed systems. We propose that accretion-induced magnetic field
changes are the missing evolutionary link between AM Her systems and
intermediate polars. The shorter ohmic decay time for accreting white dwarfs
provides a partial explanation of the lack of accreting systems with 10^9 G
fields. In rapidly accreting systems such as supersoft X-ray sources,
amplification of internal fields by compression may be important for Type Ia
supernova ignition and explosion. Finally, spreading matter in the polar cap
may induce complexity in the surface magnetic field, and explain why the more
strongly accreting pole in AM Her systems has a weaker field. We conclude with
speculations about the field evolution when classical nova explosions cause the
white dwarf mass to decrease with time.

candidate known for a massive (1e14 Msun) dark matter lens system. Here we
present results from a 65ksec Chandra observation designed to investigate
whether it is a binary quasar or a gravitational lens. We find no X-ray
evidence for a lensing cluster to a (0.5-2keV) flux limit of 2e-15 cgs, which
is consistent with lensing only for a reduced baryon fraction. Using the
Chandra X-ray observations of the quasars themselves, together with new and
published optical measurements, we use the observed emission properties of the
quasars for further tests between the lens and binary hypotheses. Assuming
similar line-of-sight absorption to the images, we find that their X-ray
continuum slopes are inconsistent (Gamma_A=2.30 and Gamma_B=0.83) as are their
X-ray to optical flux ratios. The probability that B suffers absorption
sufficient to account for these spectral differences is negligible. We present
new optical evidence that the flux ratio of the pair is variable, so the
time-delay in a lens scenario could cause some of the discrepancies. However,
adequately large variations in overall spectral energy distribution are rare in
individual QSOs. All new evidence here weighs strongly toward the binary
interpretation. Q2345+007 thus may represent the highest redshift example known
of interaction-triggered but as-yet unmerged luminous AGN.

previously unknown gamma-ray burst candidate. Statistical methods using maximum

Geminga, were readily identified, and would have been detected independently in

using the ray-tracing simulations. Motivated by the empirical lognormal model
that characterizes the probability distribution function(PDF) of the
three-dimensional mass distribution excellently, we critically investigate the
validity of lognormal model in the weak lensing statistics. Assuming that the
convergence field, $\kappa$, is approximately described by the lognormal
distribution, we present analytic formulae of convergence for the one-point PDF
and the Minkowski functionals. Comparing those predictions with ray-tracing
simulations in various cold dark matter models, we find that the one-point
lognormal PDF can describe the non-Gaussian tails of convergence fields
accurately up to $\nu\sim10$, where $\nu$ is the level threshold given by
$\nu\equiv\kappa/\var^{1/2}$, although the systematic deviation from lognormal
prediction becomes manifest at higher source redshift and larger smoothing
scales. The lognormal formulae for Minkowski functionals also fit to the
simulation results when the source redshift is low. Accuracy of the
lognormal-fit remains good even at the small angular scales, where the
perturbation formulae by Edgeworth expansion break down. On the other hand,
lognormal models does not provide an accurate prediction for the statistics
sensitive to the rare events such as the skewness and the kurtosis of
convergence. We therefore conclude that the empirical lognormal model of the
convergence field is safely applicable as a useful cosmological tool, as long

that the clusters are divided into at least two subgroups according to the core

originate in a PDR with G_0 = 15 and n(H2) about 10^4 - 10^5 cm^-3. Extended
emission is also observed in the rotational line emission of H2O and high-J CO.
However, lack of sufficient angular resolution prevents us from excluding the
possibility that the emssion regions of these lines are point like, which could
be linked to the embedded objects SMM9 and SMM4. Toward the Class0 source SMM1,
the LWS observations reveal, in addition to fine structure line emission, a
rich spectrum of molecular lines. The sub-thermally excited and optically thick
CO, H2O and OH lines are tracing an about 10^3 AU source with temperatures
higher than 300 K and densities above 10^6 cm^-3. We show that geometry is of
concern for the correct interpretation of the data and based on 2D-radiative
transfer modelling of the disk/torus around SMM1, which successfully reproduces
the entire observed SED and the observed line profiles of CO isotopomers, we
can exclude the disk to be the source of the LWS-molecular line emission. The
CAM-CVF permits us to see a region of rotational H2 emission. This H2 gas has a
temperature of 10^3 K, which suggests that the heating of the gas is achieved
through relatively slow shocks. Although we are not able to establish any firm
conclusion regarding the detailed nature of the shock waves, our observations
of the molecular line emission from SMM1 can be explainable in terms of an
admixture of J-shocks and of C-shocks.

excellent overall fit to the EPIC spectra. The iron K-alpha line is well

feature is not required by the XMM-Newton data. The upper limit on the flux
contained in any additional broad line is ~8% of that in the narrow line. The

  Cimento","Riv.Nuovo Cim.25N3:1-80,2002",,"BARI-TH 431/02","hep-ph",,"  We describe the effective lagrangian approach to the color superconductivity.
The effective description that arises if one considers only the leading terms
in the expansion for very high densities is particularly simple. It is based on
a lagrangian whose effective fermion fields are velocity-dependent; moreover
strong interactions do not change quark velocity and the effective lagrangian
does not contain spin matrices. All these features render the effective theory
similar to the Heavy Quark Effective Theory, which is the limit of Quantum
ChromoDynamics for infinite quark masses. For this reason one can refer to the
effective lagrangian at high density as the High Density Effective Theory
(HDET). In some cases HDET results in analytical, though approximate, relations
that are particularly simple to handle. After a pedagogical introduction,
several topics are considered. They include the treatment of the
Color-Flavor-Locking and the 2SC model, with evaluation of the gap parameters
by the Nambu-Gorkov equations, approximate dispersion laws for the gluons and
calculations of the Nambu-Goldstone Bosons properties. We also discuss the
effective lagrangian for the crystalline color superconductive (LOFF) phase and
we give a description of the phonon field related to the breaking of the
rotational and translational invariance. Finally a few astrophysical
applications of color superconductivity are discussed.

\subset SU(5) \times U(1)_{5} for illustration. While the noscale boundary
condition at the grand unification scale (M_{G}\simeq 2\times 10^{16} GeV) in
the MSSM is not consistent with phenomenological constraints, we show that it
is if the gaugino of the U(1)_{5} multiplet is several times heavier than the
gauginos of the MSSM. However, if SU(5) \times U(1)_{5} is further embedded in
a larger simple group, e.g. SO(10), the noscale boundary condition at M_{G} is
inconsistent with phenomenological constraints. If we relax the noscale
boundary condition and allow non-zero soft scalar masses for the Higgs fields
which spontaneously break the U(1)_{5} symmetry, the resultant spectrum of SUSY
particles becomes consistent with all the phenomenological constraints, even if
we impose the GUT relation on the gauge coupling and the gaugino mass of the
U(1)_{5}. In this case, the SUSY CP problem is also solved, since the condition
B\mu =0 at the boundary can be imposed consistently with the electroweak
symmetry breaking.

with V(\phi) > 0. Cosmological evolution in models with potentials with a
""stable"" minimum at V(\phi)<0 is similar in some respects to the evolution in
models with potentials unbounded from below. Instead of reaching an AdS regime
dominated by the negative vacuum energy, the universe reaches a turning point
where its energy density vanishes, and then it contracts to a singularity with
properties that are practically independent of V(\phi). We apply our methods to
investigation of the recently proposed cyclic universe scenario. We show that
in addition to the singularity problem there are other problems that need to be
resolved in order to realize a cyclic regime in this scenario. We propose
several modifications of this scenario and conclude that the best way to
improve it is to add a usual stage of inflation after the singularity and use
that inflationary stage to generate perturbations in the standard way.

  Our proof of the Bochner Riesz estimates is related to an argument for the
Euclidean case of C. Fefferman, and one for the boundaryless Riemannian case
that is due to the author. Here, unlike in the boundaryless Riemannian case we
cannot use parametrices for the wave equation, and instead lie on a more
economical argument that only uses the eigenfunction estimates and the finite
propagation speed of the wave equation.

through solving a key matrix equation. We find that the well-known CH equation
is included in the negative order CH hierarchy while a Dym type equation is
included in the positive order CH hierarchy. Furthermore, under two constraint
conditions between the eigenfunctions and the potentials, the CH spectral
problem is cast in: (enumerate) a new Neumann-like N-dimensional system when it
is restricted into a symplectic submanifold of $\R^{2N}$ which is proven to be
integrable by using the Dirac-Poisson bracket and the r-matrix process; and a
new Bargmann-like N-dimensional system when it is considered in the whole
$\R^{2N}$ which is proven to be integrable by using the standard Poisson
bracket and the r-matrix process. (enumerate) In the paper, we present two
$4\times4$ instead of $N\times N$ r-matrix structures. One is for the
Neumann-like CH system (not the peaked CH system), while the other one is for
the Bargmann-like CH system. The whole CH hierarchy (both positive and negative
order) is shown to have the parametric solution which obey the constraint
relation. In particular, the CH equation constrained to some symplectic
submanifold, and the Dym type equation have the parametric solutions. Moreover,
we see that the kind of parametric solution of the CH equation is not gauge
equivalent to the peakons. Solving the parametric representation of solution on
the symplectic submanifold gives a class of new algebro-geometric solution of
the CH equation.

counters. Photoreceptors signals are transmitted to LMCs through an array of
chemical synapses. We quantify a lower bound on LMC reliability, which in turn
provides a lower bound on synaptic vesicle release rate, assuming Poisson
statistics. This bound is much higher than what is found in published direct
measurements of vesicle release rates in goldfish bipolar cells, suggesting
that release statistics may be significantly sub-Poisson. Finally we study H1,
a motion sensitive tangential cell in the fly's lobula plate, which transmits
information about a continuous signal by sequences of action potentials. In an
experiment with naturalistic motion stimuli performed on a sunny day outside in

millisecond spike timing precision. Comparing the measured reliability of H1's
response to motion steps with the bounds on the accuracy of motion computation

single-mode atom laser. Specifically, we focus on the quantum phase noise of
the atomic field as expressed by the first-order coherence function, for which
we derive analytical expressions in various regimes. The decay of this function
is characterized by the coherence time, or its reciprocal, the linewidth. A
crucial contributor to the linewidth is the collisional interaction of the
atoms. We find four distinct regimes for the linewidth with increasing
interaction strength. These range from the standard laser linewidth, through
quadratic and linear regimes, to another constant regime due to quantum
revivals of the coherence function. The laser output is only coherent (Bose
degenerate) up to the linear regime. However, we show that application of a
quantum nondemolition measurement and feedback scheme will increase, by many
orders of magnitude, the range of interaction strengths for which it remains
coherent.

reproducible spin squeezing. The results of a continuous nondemolition atom
number measurement are fed back to control the quantum state of the sample. For
large samples and strong cavity coupling, the squeezing parameter minimum
scales inversely with atom number, approaching the Heisenberg limit.
Furthermore, ceasing the measurement and feedback when this minimum has been
reached will leave the sample in the maximally squeezed spin state.

Stylistic changes and format modified","Nature 416, 608 (2002)","10.1038/416608a",,"quant-ph cond-mat.str-el",,"  In this Letter we discuss the entanglement near a quantum phase transition by
analyzing the properties of the concurrence for a class of exactly solvable
models in one dimension. We find that entanglement can be classified in the
framework of scaling theory. Further, we reveal a profound difference between
classical correlations and the non-local quantum correlation, entanglement: the
correlation length diverges at the phase transition, whereas entanglement in
general remains short ranged.

that the conditions for the existence of decoherence free subspaces are
degeneracy of the oscillator frequencies and separability of the coupling with
the environment. A formal exact equation for the evolution in the case of two
oscillators is found and the decoherence free subspace is explicitly
determined. A full analytical solution for any initial condition and general
parameters (frequencies and dissipation constants) is given in the markovian
approximation and zero temperature. We find that slight relaxation of
degeneracy and separability conditions leads to the appearence of two
components in the dynamical evolution with very different decoherence times.
The ratio between the characteristic time of the weak and strong decoherent
components is given by $\tau_{WD}/\tau_{SD}\approx k/\delta k$, where $\delta
k$ is a measure of the nonseparability of the coupling to the environment and
$k$ is the mean decay constant of the oscillators.
