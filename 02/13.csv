accreting neutron stars and black holes. This description is based on a
superposition of multiple Lorentzians and offers the advantage that all QPO and
noise components are dealt with in the same way, without the need of deciding
in advance the nature of each component. This approach also allows us to
compare frequencies of features with high and low coherences in a consistent
manner and greatly facilitates comparison of power spectra across a wide range
of source types and states. We apply the model to six sources, the
low-luminosity X-ray bursters 1E 1724-3045, SLX 1735-269 and GS 1826-24, the
high-latitude transient XTE J1118+480, the bright system Cir X-1, and the Z
source GX 17+2. We find that it provides a good description of the observed
spectra, without the need for a scale-free (1/f) component. We update
previously reported correlations between characteristic frequencies of timing
features in the light of this new approach and discuss similarities between
different types of systems which may point towards similar underlying physics.

density, and velocity perturbations vanish beyond the acoustic horizon. A
localized primordial cosmological perturbation expands as an acoustic wave of
photon-baryon density perturbation with narrow spikes at its acoustic
wavefronts. These spikes provide one of the main contributions to the cosmic
microwave background radiation anisotropy on all experimentally accessible
scales. The gravitational interaction between cold dark matter and baryons
causes a dip in the observed temperature of the radiation at the center of the
initial perturbation. We first model the radiation by a perfect fluid and then
extend our analysis to account for finite photon mean free path. The resulting
diffusive corrections smear the sharp features in the photon and baryon density
Green's functions over the scale of Silk damping.

confinement in large-scale magnetic field or by the difference in electric
potentials (generalized Hillas criterion), but also by the synchrotron
radiation, the electro-bremsstrahlung, or the curvature radiation of
accelerated particles. Optimization of these requirements in terms of
accelerator's size and magnetic field strength results in the ultimate lower
limit to the overall source energy, which scales as the fifth power of
attainable particle energy. Hard gamma-rays accompanying generation of EHECRs
can be used as a probe for potential acceleration sites. We apply the results

feedback between the radiation reprocessed by the disk and the thermal
Comptonization emission from the hot central plasma plays a pivotal role in
determining the X-ray spectrum, and as we show, the optical and ultraviolet
spectra as well. Seemingly uncorrelated optical/UV and X-ray light curves,
similar to those which have been observed from these objects can be explained
by variations in the size, shape, and temperature of the Comptonizing plasma.
Furthermore, by positing a disk mass accretion rate which satisfies a condition
for global energy balance between the thermal Comptonization luminosity and the
power available from accretion, one can predict the spectral properties of the
hard X-ray continuum above $\sim 50$ keV in type 1 Seyfert galaxies.
Forthcoming measurements of the hard X-ray continuum by more sensitive hard

that small departures from synchronous rotation can occur because of
fluid-dynamical torques within these planets. Previous radiative-transfer and
evolution models of such planets assume a homogeneous atmosphere. Nevertheless,
we show using simple arguments that, at the photosphere, the day-night
temperature difference and characteristic wind speeds may reach ~500 K and ~2
km/s, respectively. Substantial departures from chemical equilibrium are
expected. The cloud coverage depends sensitively on the dynamics; clouds could
exist predominantly either on the dayside or nightside, depending on the
circulation regime. Radiative-transfer models that assume homogeneous
conditions are therefore inadequate in describing the atmospheric properties of
51Peg b-like planets. We present preliminary three-dimensional, nonlinear
simulations of the atmospheric circulation of HD209458b that indicate plausible
patterns for the circulation and generally agree with our simpler estimates.
Furthermore, we show that kinetic energy production in the atmosphere can lead
to the deposition of substantial energy in the interior, with crucial
consequences for the evolution of these planets. Future measurements of
reflected and thermally-emitted radiation from these planets will help test our
ideas.

level great than 2% of coronal intensity. We describe several improvements made
over the 1998 eclipse that led to increased image clarity and sensitivity. The
corona was brighter in 1999 with the solar maximum, further improving the data.
We use Fourier analysis to search in the [Fe XIV] channel for intensity
oscillations in loops at the base of the corona. Such oscillations in the 1-Hz
range are predicted as a result of density fluctuations from the resonant
absorption of MHD waves. The dissipation of a significant amount of mechanical
energy from the photosphere into the corona through this mechanism could
provide sufficient energy to hear the corona. A Monte-Carlo model of the data
suggests the presence of enhanced power, particularly in the 0.75-1.0 Hz range,

Msun/yr. The X-ray luminosity of the active nucleus of M87 observed with
Chandra is L_{x, 0.5-7 \keV} \sim 7 \times 10^{40}erg/s. This value is much
less than the predicted nuclear luminosity, L_{Bondi} \sim 5 \times 10^{44}
erg/s, for accretion at the Bondi rate with a canonical accretion radiative
efficiency of 10%. If the black hole in M87 accretes at this rate it must do so
at a much lower radiative efficiency than the canonical value. The
multiwavelength spectrum of the nucleus is consistent with that predicted by an
advection-dominated flow. However, as is likely, the X-ray nucleus is dominated
by jet emission then the properties of flow must be modified, possibly by
outflows. We show that the overall energetics of the system are just consistent
with the predicted Bondi nuclear power. This suggests that either most of the
accretion energy is released in the relativistic jet or that the central engine
of M87 undergoes on-off activity cycles. We show that, at present, the energy
dumped into the ISM by the jet may reduce the accretion rate onto the black
hole by a factor \propto (v_j/c_s)^{-2}, where v_j is the jet velocity and c_s
the ISM sound speed, and that this is sufficient to account for the low nuclear

hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wide-angle winds interacting with a
collapsing environment. These simulations have direct relevance to young
stellar objects (YSOs). The results may also be of use in the study of
collimated outflows from proto-planetary and planetary nebulae. We study a
range of wind configurations consistent with asymptotic MHD wind collimation.
The degree of collimation is parameterized by the ratio of the wind density at
the pole to that of the equator. We find that a toroidal magnetic field can
have a significant influence on the resulting outflow, giving rise to a very
dense, jet-like flow in the post-shock region. The properties of the flow in
this region are similar to the asymptotic state of a collimated MHD wind. We
conclude that wide-angle MHD winds are quite likely capable of driving
molecular outflows. Due to difficulty in treating MHD winds ab-initio in
simulations we choose magnetic field strengths in the wind consistent slow
magnetic rotators. While MHD launched winds will be in the fast rotator regime
we discuss how our results, which rely on toroidal pinch effects, will hold for
stronger field strengths.

it does constrain the overall contribution by white dwarfs brighter than M_V ~

confirms a similar study by Reyle et al (2001).

  of shear and density stratification","6 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, Astronomy and Astrophysics (subm.)",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20020853",,"astro-ph",,"  The hydrodynamic stability of accretion disks is considered. The particular
question is whether the combined action of a (stable) vertical density
stratification and a (stable) radial differential rotation gives rise to a new
instability for nonaxisymmetric modes of disturbances. The existence of such an
instability is not suggested by the well-known Solberg-Hoiland criterion. It is
also not suggested by a local analysis for disturbances in general
stratifications of entropy and angular momentum which is presented in our
Section 2 confirming the results of the Solberg-Hoiland criterion also for
nonaxisymmetric modes within the frame of ideal hydrodynamics but only in the
frame of a short-wave approximation for small m. As a necessary condition for
stability we find that only conservative external forces are allowed to
influence the stable disk. As magnetic forces are never conservative, linear
disk instabilities should only exist in the magnetohydrodynamical regime which
indeed contains the magnetorotational instability as a much-promising
candidate. To overcome some of the used approximations in a numerical
approach,the equations of the compressible adiabatic hydrodynamics are
integrated imposing initial nonaxisymmetric velocity perturbations with m=1 to
m=200.
  Only solutions with decaying kinetic energy are found. The system always
settles in a vertical equilibrium stratification according to pressure balance
with the gravitational potential of the central object. keywords: accretion

decay rates of satellite dwarf galaxies orbiting a disc galaxy embedded in a
dark matter halo (DMH). We consider both spherical and oblate axisymmetric DMHs
of aspect ratio q_h=0.6. The satellites are given different initial orbital
inclinations, orbital periods and mass. The live flattened DMHs with embedded
discs and bulges are set-up using a new fast algorithm, MaGalie (Boily, Kroupa
and Pe\~{n}arrubia 2001).
  We find that the range of survival times of satellites within a flattened DMH
becomes of the order of 100% larger than the same satellites within a spherical
DMH. In the oblate DMH, satellites on polar orbits have the longest survival
time, whereas satellites on coplanar prograde orbits are destroyed most
rapidly. The orbital plane of a satellite tilts as a result of anisotropic
dynamical friction, causing the satellite's orbit to align with the plane of
symmetry of the DMH. Polar orbits are not subjected to alignment. Therefore the
decay of a satellites in an axisymmetric DMH may provide a natural explanation
for the observed lack of satellites within (0-30) degrees of their host
galaxy's disc (Holmberg 1969; Zaritsky and Gonz\'alez 1999).
  The computations furthermore indicate that the evolution of the orbital
eccentricity $e$ is highly dependent of its initial value e(t=0) and the DMH's
shape. We also discuss some implications of flattened DMHs for satellite debris
streams.

function. Nearly 95% of previously known quasars are recovered (based on 1540

sublinear dependence of the persistence length on the screening length can be
ruled out. We argue that previous numerical results pointing into this

a lot to be desired. In particular, it differs from real networks in two
crucial ways: it lacks network clustering or transitivity, and it has an
unrealistic Poissonian degree distribution. In this paper we review some recent
work on generalizations of the random graph aimed at correcting these
shortcomings. We describe generalized random graph models of both directed and

of Ginzburg-Landau parameters $\kappa \in [0.76-1]/\sqrt{2}$ upon increasing
the temperature in the superconducting state. This corresponds to a thermally
induced crossover from \typeI to \typeII superconductivity around a temperature
$T_{\rm{Cr}}(\kappa)$, which we map out in the vicinity of the
metal-to-superconductor transition. In order to see this crossover, it is
essential to include amplitude fluctuations of the matter field, in addition to
phase-fluctuations and gauge-field fluctuations. We present a simple physical
picture of the crossover, and relate it to observations in \metal{Ta} and
\metal{Nb} elemental superconductors which have low-temperature values of
$\kappa$ in the relevant range.

Hamiltonian defined on a graph $\L={\cal A}\cup{\cal B}$ with ${\cal A}\cap
{\cal B}=\emptyset$ and bonds connecting any element of ${\cal A}$ with all the
elements of ${\cal B}$. Since all the hopping matrix elements associated with
each bond are equal, the model is invariant under an arbitrary permutation of
the ${\cal A}$-sites and/or of the ${\cal B}$-sites. This is the Hubbard model
defined on the so called $(N_{A},N_{B})$-complete-bipartite graph, $N_{A}$
($N_{B}$) being the number of elements in ${\cal A}$ (${\cal B}$). In this
paper we analytically find the {\it exact} ground state for $N_{A}=N_{B}=N$ at
half filling for any $N$; the repulsion has a maximum at a critical
$N$-dependent value of the on-site Hubbard $U$. The wave function and the
energy of the unique, singlet ground state assume a particularly elegant form
for $N \ra \inf$. We also calculate the spin-spin correlation function and show
that the ground state exhibits an antiferromagnetic order for any non-zero $U$
even in the thermodynamic limit. We are aware of no previous explicit analytic
example of an antiferromagnetic ground state in a Hubbard-like model of
itinerant electrons. The kinetic term induces non-trivial correlations among
the particles and an antiparallel spin configuration in the two sublattices
comes to be energetically favoured at zero Temperature. On the other hand, if
the thermodynamic limit is taken and then zero Temperature is approached, a
paramagnetic behavior results. The thermodynamic limit does not commute with
the zero-Temperature limit, and this fact can be made explicit by the analytic
solutions.

reconstruct decays of neutral B mesons to the following CP eigenstates: J/psi
K_S^0, psi(2S) K_S^0, chi_c1 K_S^0, eta_c K_S^0, J/psi K_L^0 and J/psi K^*0.

extra dimension compactified on the orbifold S_1/Z_2, leaving only the standard
model gauge group SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y unbroken in the low energy 4D
theory. The Higgs doublets are zero modes of bulk SU(3)_W triplets and serve to
normalize the hypercharge generator, apparently giving a tree-level prediction
for the weak mixing angle: \sin^2\theta = 1/4. The orbifold boundary conditions
imply a restricted set of SU(3)_W gauge transformations: at an orbifold fixed
point only the transformations of SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y are operative. This allows
quarks to be located at this fixed point, overcoming the longstanding problem
of how to incorporate matter in a unified SU(3)_W theory. However, in general
this local, explicit breaking of SU(3)_W symmetry, necessary for including
quarks into the theory, destroys the tree-level prediction for the weak mixing
angle. This apparent contradiction is reconciled by making the volume of the
extra dimension large, diluting the effects of the local SU(3)_W violation. In
the case that the electroweak theory is strongly coupled at the cutoff scale of
the effective theory, radiative corrections to the weak mixing angle can be
reliably computed, and used to predict the scale of compactification: 1 - 2 TeV
without supersymmetry, and in the region of 3 - 6 TeV for a supersymmetric
theory. The experimental signature of electroweak unification into SU(3)_W is a
set of ``weak partners'' of mass 1/2R, which are all electrically charged and
are expected to be accessible at LHC. These include weak doublets of gauge
particles of electric charge (++,+), and a charged scalar. When pair produced,
they yield events containing multiple charged leptons, missing large transverse
energy and possibly Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons.

Problem studies the coincidence set C={x:f(x)=g(x)}. The number m=dimX-dimY is
called the codimension of the problem. More general is the Preimage Problem.
For a map f:X->Z and a submanifold Y of Z, it studies the preimage set
C={x:f(x) in Y}, and the codimension is m=dimX+dimY-dimZ. In case of
codimension 0, the classical Nielsen number N(f,Y) is a lower estimate of the
number of points in C changing under homotopies of f, and for an arbitrary
codimension, of the number of components of C. We extend this theory to take
into account other topological characteristics of C. The goal is to find a
""lower estimate"" of the bordism group Omega_{p}(C) of C. The answer is the
Nielsen group S_{p}(f,Y) defined as follows. In the classical definition the
Nielsen equivalence of points of C based on paths is replaced with an
equivalence of singular submanifolds of C based on bordisms. We let
S_{p}^{prime}(f,Y) be the quotient group of Omega_{p}(C) with respect to this
equivalence relation, then the Nielsen group of order p is the part of this
group preserved under homotopies of f. The Nielsen number N_{p}(f,Y) of order p
is the rank of this group (then N(f,Y)=N_{0}(f,Y)). These numbers are new
obstructions to removability of coincidences and preimages. Some examples and

equations without mean temperature gradient. This system is referred to as free
convection in this paper. Under an external flow described by the stream
function $\mPsi = - Ayf(x)$, two types of steady solutions are found depending
on the boundary conditions. One is kept steady by the balance between the
strain of $\mPsi$ and the diffusion. The solution is similar to the Burgers
vortex layer solution. The other is done by the balance between vorticity
induced by the buoyancy and vorticity flux caused by the external flow.
Detailed argument on these two balances is presented for $f(x) = x$. Then two
examples other than $f(x) = x$ are shown to have either of the two balancing

gates on multi-qubit systems. Compared to low power selective pulses, which
cannot average out all unwanted evolution, these pulses are substantially
shorter in time, thereby reducing the effects of relaxation. Liquid-state NMR
techniques on homonuclear spin systems are used to demonstrate the accuracy of
these gates both in simulation and experiment. Simulations of the coherent

implement the unitary operations, typically yielding gate fidelities on the

this way of analysis to models where such a behavior is not generally expected.
In order to obtain significant results we approach the problem by a
renormalization group method that can give a fixed point Hamiltonian that has
the shape of a harmonic oscillator. In this way, good approximations are
obtained for the ground state both for the eigenfunction and the eigenvalue for
problems like the quartic oscillator, the one-dimensional Coulomb potential
having a not normalizable ground state solution and for the one-dimensional
Kramers-Henneberger potential. We keep a coupling constant in the potential and
take it running with a generic cut-off that goes to infinity. The solution of
the Callan-Symanzik equation for the coupling constant generates the harmonic
oscillator Hamiltonian describing the behavior of the model at very small
distances (ultraviolet behavior). This approach, although algorithmic in its
very nature, does not appear to have a simple extension to obtain excited state
behavior. Rather, it appears as a straightforward non-perturbative method.

strengths we find a sudden change in the photon statistics of the light emitted

narrow range of intracavity photon number. It is proven that this sudden change
in photon statistics occurs due to the existence of robust quantum interference
of transitions between the dressed states of the atom-cavity system.
Furthermore, it is shown that the strong photon bunching is a nonclassical
effect for certain values of driving field strength, violating classical
