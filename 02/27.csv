reviewed and compared with recent observational data. The single unknown
parameter of standard BBN is the baryon-to-photon ratio, \eta, and can be
determined by the concordance between theory and observation. Recent CMB
anisotropy measurements also lead to a determination of \eta and these results
are contrasted with those from BBN. In addition, the CMB data indicate that the
Universe is spatially flat. Thus it is clear that some form of non-baryonic
dark matter or dark energy is necessary. Here I will also review the current
expectations for cold dark matter from minimal supersymmetric models. The
viability of detecting supersymmetric dark matter will also be discussed.

residuals for the non-variable bright red giants. Although these residuals are
small there is, however, a systematic trend in the sense that the larger ones

the cluster proper motion). In contrast, most of the variable stars do show
significant intrinsic polarization. The behavior of the star-free regions is
similar to that of the non-variable stars and sets an upper limit to the
possible existence of a global pattern of scattered (and polarized)
intra-cluster light in the V band. In turn, the multicolor observations of the

combination of the foreground interstellar component and another one arising in

describe and characterize a well-defined relation between absolute magnitude
and surface brightness for galaxy cluster members across the entire range of
galaxy luminosity from M_B = -20 to M_B = -11. The galaxies that are assigned
by our techniques to the background show no such tight relationship between
apparent magnitude and surface brightness, with the exception of those we
identify as being members of a background cluster of galaxies at z ~ 0.55. We,
however, find that at the fainter magnitudes, M_B > -16, there is a large
scatter about the underlying color--magnitude relation defined by the brighter
galaxies. Our analysis also indicates that the vast majority of Perseus
galaxies are `normal', with little evidence for features associated with
evolution; we however discuss the detailed properties of a handful of unusual
galaxies. Finally, the galaxy luminosity function of the Perseus cluster center

galaxies. Considering these cold clouds instead of hot homogeneous gas as the
main baryonic component of proto-galactic halos may affect several issues
during galaxy formation. In particular, the baryonic matter loses angular
momentum through dynamical friction on the dark matter halo. In numerical
simulations using hot gas for baryonic matter, this gives rise to the so-called
angular momentum problem. In this work, we study the dynamical friction exerted
on cold fractal gas by a collisionless background (dark matter) through
high-resolution numerical simulations. First, we find that, for values of the
parameters relevant during galaxy formation, the friction does not alter the
morphology of the fractal, which is mainly driven by internal dynamics. Then,
we show that the presence of substructures and inhomogeneities in a body has
little effect on the global value of the friction. Parameters such as branching
ratio and fractal dimension also have little effect. In fact, we find out that
the main effect comes from the deformations and fluctuations of the fractal
structure in cold gas clumps. If the deformation time is of the same order of
magnitude or shorter than the typical build-up time of the friction, the
friction is weakened. We argue that this effect is relevant for galaxy
formation, and that the angular momentum problem should not be worsened by
including the small scale inhomogeneities of the cold gas which occur at a
resolution out of reach of present simulations.

of the Turn Off (TO), Zero Age Horizontal Branch (ZAHB) and Red Giant Branch
bump (BUMP), on the cluster metallicity and age. Taking into account these

difference between the TO and the ZAHB, and the TO and the RGB-bump, given by
$A=\Delta M_V$(TO-BUMP)$-0.566\Delta M_V$(TO-ZAHB). We show that the parameter
$A$ does not depend at all on the cluster age, whereas it does strongly depend
on the cluster global metallicity. The calibration of the parameter $A$ as a
function of $Z$ is then provided, as based on our evolutionary models. We
tested the reliability of this result by also considering stellar models
computed by other authors,employing different input physics. Eventually, we
present clear evidence that the variation of $\Delta M_V$(TO-BUMP) with $\Delta
M_V$(TO-ZAHB) does supply a powerful probe of the global metal abundance, at
least when homogeneous theoretical frameworks are adopted. We provide an

the T=0 superconductor-insulator transition in underdoped cuprates. The
coupling constant (""charge"") in this theory is proportional to the dual order
parameter of the XY model, which is assumed to be describing the quantum
fluctuations of the phase of the superconducting order parameter. The principal
result is that the destruction of phase coherence in d-wave superconductors
typically, and immediately, leads to antiferromagnetism. The transition can be
understood in terms of the spontaneous breaking of an approximate ""chiral""
SU(2) symmetry, which may be discerned at low enough energies in the standard
d-wave superconductor. The mechanism of the symmetry breaking is analogous to
the dynamical mass generation in the QED3, with the ""mass"" here being
proportional to staggered magnetization. Other insulating phases that break
chiral symmetry include the translationally invariant ""d+ip"" and ""d+is""
insulators, and various one dimensional charge-density and spin-density waves.

domain decomposition and can handle one- to three-dimensional problems. It has
three distinct features. First, the combined problem of solving the PDE,
satisfying the boundary conditions, and matching between different subdomains
is cast into one set of equations readily accessible to standard linear and
nonlinear solvers. Second, touching as well as overlapping subdomains are
supported; both rectangular blocks with Chebyshev basis functions as well as
spherical shells with an expansion in spherical harmonics are implemented.
Third, the code is very flexible: The domain decomposition as well as the
distribution of collocation points in each domain can be chosen at run time,
and the solver is easily adaptable to new PDEs. The code has been used to solve
the equations of the initial value problem of general relativity and should be
useful in many other problems. We compare the new method to finite difference
codes and find it superior in both runtime and accuracy, at least for the
smooth problems considered here.

electrically charged and stable on the timescales of collider experiments. If
such a particle were to be observed experimentally, is it possible to determine
whether or not it is stable on cosmological timescales? Charged, stable
particles are usually considered to be excluded by cosmological arguments
coupled with terrestrial searches for anomalously heavy water molecules. But
when the cosmology is significantly altered, as can happen in models with large
extra dimensions, these arguments are in turn significantly weakened. In this
paper we suggest an alternate way to use searches for superheavy water to
constrain the lifetimes of long-lived, charged particles, independent of most
cosmological assumptions. By considering SUSY production by cosmic rays in the
upper atmosphere, we are able to use current bounds on superheavy water to
constrain the mass scale of squarks and gluinos to be greater than about 230
GeV, assuming a stable, charged LSP. This bound can be increased, but only by
significantly increasing the size of the initial water sample tested.

topologies induced by nearby resonances via final-state rescattering can be

in $D\to PP$ decays is dominated by resonant final-state interactions (FSIs),
its amplitude in VP decays (V: vector meson, P: pseudoscalar meson) receives
little contributions from FSIs in the quark-antiquark resonance formation. As a
consequence, the sign flip of the W-exchange amplitude in $D\to\bar K^*\pi$ and
$\bar K\rho$ decays, which is needed to explain the relatively real decay

nonperturbative effect related to the quarkonium and that related to $\eta'$ or
$\eta$, in which the later is parameterized by distribution amplitudes of
gluons in $\eta'$. With this factorization approach we obtain theoretical
predictions which are in agreement with experiment. Uncertainties in our

relativistic corrections for $J/\Psi$ and the value of the charm quark mass. We

weakly homotopy equivalent to knot spaces when the ambient dimension is greater

entraining the ambient medium, while apparently similar turbulent jets in
general lose their identity within a small distance through entrainment and
mixing. From dynamical systems computations on a model chaotic vortical flow, I
show that entrainment and mixing due to coherent structures depend sensitively
on the relative speeds of different portions of the flow. A small change in
these speeds, effected for example by heating, drastically alters the sizes of
the KAM tori and the chaotic mixing region. The entrainment rate and, hence,
the lifetime of a turbulent shear flow, shows a universal, non-monotone
dependence on the heating.

the prospects for a machine operated remotely from far sites are encouraging.

Experts are required to be on site only during initial commissioning and for

A 66, 032110 (2002)","10.1103/PhysRevA.66.032110",,"quant-ph cond-mat",,"  What entanglement is present in naturally occurring physical systems at
thermal equilibrium? Most such systems are intractable and it is desirable to
study simple but realistic systems which can be solved. An example of such a
system is the 1D infinite-lattice anisotropic XY model. This model is exactly
solvable using the Jordan-Wigner transform, and it is possible to calculate the
two-site reduced density matrix for all pairs of sites. Using the two-site
density matrix, the entanglement of formation between any two sites is
calculated for all parameter values and temperatures. We also study the
entanglement in the transverse Ising model, a special case of the XY model,
which exhibits a quantum phase transition. It is found that the next-nearest
neighbour entanglement (though not the nearest-neighbour entanglement) is a
maximum at the critical point. Furthermore, we show that the critical point in
the transverse Ising model corresponds to a transition in the behaviour of the
entanglement between a single site and the remainder of the lattice.

distillation of entanglement. The distinguishing information (DI) and the
maximal distinguishing information (MDI) of a set of pure states are defined.
The interpretation of distillation of entanglement in term of information is
given. The relation between the maximal distinguishing information and
distillable entanglement is gained. As a application of this relation the
distillable entanglement of Bell-diagonal states is present.

two degenerate levels and stimulated by a laser and we compute its fluorescence
spectrum; let us stress that, once the model for the unitary atom-field
dynamics has been given, then the spectrum is computed without further
approximations. If only the absorption/emission term is included in the
interaction, we reobtain the Mollow spectrum in the case of a monochromatic
laser and the Kimble-Mandel spectrum in the case of a ""phase diffusion model""
for a non monochromatic laser. However, our model can describe also another
type of light scattering, a ""direct scattering"" due to the response of the atom
as a whole, which we expect to be small, but which interferes with the
scattering due to the absorption/emission channel. When both the scattering
channels are introduced we obtain a modification of the Mollow-Kimble-Mandel
spectrum, which shares the main features with the usual case, but which
presents some asymmetries even in the case of no detuning.
