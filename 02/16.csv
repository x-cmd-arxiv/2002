and spectroscopy of the interaction between the ejecta of SN 1987A and its
equatorial circumstellar ring. This interaction has made a transition, from
emission originating in just a few ``hot spots'' at restricted locations in
position angle around the ring, to a collision producing optical emission over
a nearly continuous distribution, with few breaks larger than 45 degrees. The
centroids of the first three spots are measured to move at 2000-3000 km/s,
which we interpret as a lower limit of the velocity of the forward blast front.
Multi-wavelength light curves of the spots show that they do not evolve
uniformly, and change significantly on timescales as short as one month; in
particular the first spot shows a significant break in its lightcurve.
Implications of observed delays between spots appearances are discussed, which
leads to a generalized model of hot spot evolution, and suggests that the early
appearance of the first hot spot is explained by its inward radial position and
a fairly uniform forward blast wave, rather than extraordinary physical
circumstances. Data further suggest that the forward blast is reaching the bulk
of the inner ring material to the east, the density of which appears higher
than elsewhere in the ring. We study the ring geometry, finding evidence
suggestive of an intrinsic ellipticity of 0.95, and find lower and upper
distance limits of 47.9 +/- 0.92 kpc and 54.4 +/- 2.1 kpc, respectively.

92 Hz. In each case, we can model the QPO profiles while assuming that the

next investigate the X-ray energy spectra, and we find a systematic increase in

similar values of the dimensionless spin parameter. We discuss physical
mechanisms that may explain these HFQPOs. In particular, a resonance between

  M32","Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters","Astrophys.J. v.568, L13 (2002)","10.1086/340274",,"astro-ph",,"  M32 is the prototype for the relatively rare class of galaxies referred to as
`compact ellipticals'. It has been suggested that M32 may be a tidally
disturbed r^(1/4) elliptical galaxy, or the remnant bulge of a disk-stripped
early-type spiral galaxy. This paper reveals that the surface brightness
profile, the velocity dispersion measurements, and the estimated supermassive
black hole mass in M32 are inconsistent with the galaxy having, and probably
ever having had, an r^(1/4) light profile. Instead, the radial surface
brightness distribution of M32 resembles an almost perfect (bulge + exponential
disk) profile, which is accompanied by a marked increase in the ellipticity
profile and an associated change in the position angle profile where the `disk'
starts to dominate. Compelling evidence that this bulge/disk interpretation is
accurate comes from the best-fitting r^(1/n) bulge model which has a Sersic
index n=1.5, in agreement with the recently discovered relation between a
bulge's Sersic index and the mass of its supermassive black hole. An index n>4
would also be inconsistent with the stellar velocity dispersion of M32. The
bulge-to-disk size ratio r_e /h equals 0.20, and the logarithm of the
bulge-to-disk luminosity ratio log(B/D) equals 0.22, typical of lenticular
galaxies. The effective radius of the bulge is 27"" (~100 pc), while the
scale-length of the disk is less well determined: due to possible tidal-
stripping of the outer profile beyond 220-250"", the scale-length may be as
large as 1.3 kpc. M32 is a relatively face-on, nucleated, dwarf galaxy with a
low surface brightness disk and a high surface brightness bulge. This finding
brings into question the existence of the compact elliptical class of galaxies.

burst occurring at a redshift of 2.140 +/- 0.001. The optical afterglow decays
as a power law with a slope of alpha = 0.83 +/- 0.04 for the first
approximately two days after the burst at which time there is evidence for a
break. The slope after the break is at least 1.4. There is evidence for rapid
variations in the R-band light approximately 0.5 days after the burst. These
variations suggest that there are density fluctuations near the gamma-ray burst
on spatial scales of approximately 40--125 AU. The magnitude of the break in
the light curve, the spectral slope, and the rate of decay in the optical,
suggest that the burst expanded into an ambient medium that is homogeneous on
large scales. We estimate that the local particle density is between
approximately 0.1 and 10 cm^{-3} and that the total gamma-ray energy in the
burst was 1.2--1.9 x 10^{50} erg. This energy is smaller than, but consistent
with, the ``standard'' value of (5 +/- 2) x 10^{50} erg. Comparing the observed
color of the optical afterglow with predictions of the standard beaming model
suggests that the rest-frame V-band extinction in the host galaxy is less than
approximately 0.03 mag.

chromosphere the time scale is long ($10^3$-$10^5$ s), except in shocks where
the increased temperature and density shorten the time scale for
ionization/recombination, especially in the upper chromosphere. Because the
relaxation time scale is much longer than dynamic time scales, hydrogen
ionization does not have time to reach its equilibrium value and its
fluctuations are much smaller than the variation of its statistical equilibrium
value appropriate for the instantaneous conditions. The ionization state tends
to represent the higher temperature of the shocks, and the mean electron
density is up to a factor of six higher than the electron density calculated in
statistical equilibrium from the mean atmosphere. The simulations show that a
static picture and a dynamic picture of the chromosphere are fundamentally
different and that time variations are crucial for our understanding of the

nematic liquid crystalline (LC) semi-flexible polymers. A measure of transient
elastic strain due to the change in length of macromolecular strands under

anisotropic viscoelasticity and evolution equation for the director in flows of
LC polymers. When LC macromolecules are relatively rigid or when they are soft
but the flow is slow, a weakly nonlinear viscoelastic anisotropic behavior is
described by few temperature dependent parameters. In the infinitesimal case
the evolution equation for director reminds the Ericksens equation, but with an
additional relaxation term. The present theory can also be applied for

the recently discovered superconductor MgCNi_3, the effect of Fe and Co
substitution at the Ni site and the effect of pressure are reported. It is
shown that a two band model provides a consistent interpretation of the
temperature dependence of the normal state resistance and the Hall constant.
Whereas band structure calculations suggest an increase in T_c upon partial
substitution of Ni with Fe and Co, Co substitution quenches superconductivity
and Fe substitution leads to an increase followed by a decrease in T_c. The
observed variation of T_c may be explained in terms of a competition between
increase in T_c due to increase in density of states and a decrease due to spin
fluctuations. Based on these results, it is suggested that the spin
fluctuations are weaker in Fe doped samples as compared to the Co doped ones.
An initial decrease in T_c (and the normal state resistance) followed by an
increase is observed on application of pressure. The decrease in T_c for small
applied pressures can be understood in terms of the decrease in the density of
states at the Fermi level. The subsequent increase in T_c with pressure is due
to a lattice softening or a structural phase transition, consistent with the
band structure calculations. It is conjectured that suppression of spin
fluctuations by pressure may also be responsible for the observed increase in
T_c at higher pressures.

  Collisions, Hirschegg, Jan. 13-19, 2002",,,,"nucl-th hep-ph",,"  In the context of the `jet quenching' phenomena typically materialization of
the jet is assumed to take place in vacuum outside the reaction zone. On the
other hand quantum mechanical estimates give a hadronization time on the order
of only a few fm/c for jets materializing into hadrons with transverse momenta
of $\pT{} \leq 10 GeV$, which thus should well take place inside the fireball.
Typical (in-)elastic collisions of these high $\pT{}$ particles with the bulk
of hadrons of the fireball have a rather low invariant mass and are thus
nonperturbative. An analysis within an opacity expansion in the number of
collisions by means of the FRITIOF collision scheme for various hadrons will be
presented. It shows that late hadronic collisions can substantially account for
the modification of the high $\pT{} $-spectrum observed for central collisions
at RHIC.
