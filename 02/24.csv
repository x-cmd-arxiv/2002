-14 it rises steeply, with a logarithmic slope alpha ~ -1.6. Fainter than M_B =
-14, the LF flattens again. This LF is shallower (although turning up at
brighter absolute magnitudes) than the R-band LF recently measured by Phillipps
et al. (1998), who found alpha ~ -2.2 fainter than M_R = -13. It is similar,
however, to the LF determined from the Virgo Cluster Catalog by Sandage et al.
(1985). A few faint galaxies are found which Sandage, et al. missed because
their surface-brightness threshold for detection was too high, but these do not
dominate the luminosity function at any magnitude. Most of the faint galaxies
we find are dwarf elliptical, alternatively called dwarf spheroidal, galaxies.
The most important potential source of systematic error is that we may have
rejected some high surface-brightness galaxies from the cluster sample because
we think that they are background galaxies. This is quite different from what
has conventionally been regarded as the most serious source of systematic error
in this kind of study: that we are missing many LOW surface-brightness galaxies
because they are never visible above the sky.

decayed 0.5 mags from December 2000 to its present near quiescent level at

modulation that we interpret as a superhump of P_sh=0.17049(1) d i.e. 0.3%
longer than the orbital period. This implies a disc precession period P_prec=
52 d. After correcting the average phase-folded light curve for veiling, the
amplitude difference between the minima suggests that the binary inclination
angle lies in the range i=71-82 deg. However, we urge caution in the
interpretation of these values because of residual systematic contamination of
the ellipsoidal lightcurve by the complex form of the superhump modulation. The
orbital--mean H-alpha profiles exhibit clear velocity variations with ~500 km/s
amplitude. We interpret this as the first spectroscopic evidence of an
eccentric precessing disc.

multipole spectral indices typically ranging between about -3 and about -1,

made to understand such modes of behaviour within the framework of nonlinear

these models that remains uncertain is the nature of the boundary conditions on
the magnetic field. Here by employing a range of physically plausible boundary
conditions, we show that for near-critical and moderately supercritical dynamo

respectively. The X-ray filament lies at the edge of the nonthermal radio
filaments and a dense molecular shell G0.13-0.13 that has an unusually high
kinetic temperature $\ge$70K. These observations demonstrate that the
G0.13--0.13 molecular cloud and the nonthermal radio filaments of the Arc are
interacting. The diffuse X-ray emission is correlated with the molecular shell
and is fitted either by two-temperature (1 and 10 keV) thermal emission or by
power-law and 1 keV thermal gas. Fluorescent 6.4 keV line emission is also
detected throughout the molecular shell. This cloud coincides within the error
circle of a steady unidentified EGRET source 3EGJ1746--2851. We argue that
low-energy cosmic ray electrons (LECRe) produce the power-law continuum by
bremsstrahlung and 6.4 keV line emission from the filament and the diffuse
cloud with the implication on the origin of the Galactic ridge X-ray emission.
The strong 6.4 keV Fe-line emission seen from other Galactic center clouds
could be produced in a similar fashion rather than via fluorescent emission
induced by a transient hard X-ray source in the Galactic center. In addition,
heating by ionization induced by LECRe are also responsible for the high

geometry of the interior region is completely determined in terms of background
objects. When any of the most widely used energy-momentum contents for the

Einstein-Straus model, which is the generally accepted answer for the null
influence of the cosmic expansion on the local physics, is not a robust model

  At the non-perturbative level, an apparent conflict then arises between the
chiral U(1) symmetry of the regularized theory and the existence of 't Hooft
vertices in the renormalized theory. The only possible resolution of the
paradox is that the chiral U(1) symmetry is broken spontaneously in the
enlarged Hilbert space of the covariantly gauge-fixed theory. The corresponding
Goldstone boson is unphysical. The theory must therefore be defined by
introducing a small fermion-mass term that breaks explicitly the chiral U(1)
invariance, and is sent to zero after the infinite-volume limit has been taken.
Using this careful definition (and a lattice regularization) for the
calculation of correlation functions in the one-instanton sector, we show that

smooth compactification. This resolves a weak form of the global version of a
conjecture of Crew; the proof uses the local version of the conjecture,
established separately by Andre, Mebkhout and the author.

$2n\times 2n$ -dimensional matrix into Bunse-Gerstner form. If the given matrix
is skew-Hamiltonian, the transformation gives a solution of an antisymmetric
Riccati matrix equation, resulting from optimal control of linear systems.

investigated from microscopic dynamics. The largest Lyapunov exponent and
entropies are considered for manifesting chaos and equipartition behaviors of
the system. It is found, for the first time, that for any large while finite
system size there exist two critical couplings for the transitions to
equipartitions, and the scaling behaviors of these lower and upper critical
couplings vs the system size is numerically obtained.

occurred during the famous confirmation experiments of the Maxwellian theory.
It is commonly held however that it cannot be explained in the framework of
that theory. We are calling attention to some aspects linked with the
interpretation of that effect on which, in our opinion, it is worthwhile
reflecting.
