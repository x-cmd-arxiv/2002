with a typical cluster containing $10^4 - 10^6$ stars. As an old population of
stars, globular clusters contain many collapsed and degenerate objects. As a
dense population of stars, globular clusters are the scene of many interesting
close dynamical interactions between stars. These dynamical interactions can
alter the evolution of individual stars and can produce tight binary systems
containing one or two compact objects. In this review, we discuss the
theoretical models of globular cluster evolution and binary evolution,
techniques for simulating this evolution which lead to relativistic binaries,
and current and possible future observational evidence for this population.
Globular cluster evolution will focus on the properties that boost the
production of hard binary systems and on the tidal interactions of the galaxy
with the cluster, which tend to alter the structure of the globular cluster
with time. The interaction of the components of hard binary systems alters the
evolution of both bodies and can lead to exotic objects. Direct $N$-body
integrations and Fokker-Planck simulations of the evolution of globular
clusters that incorporate tidal interactions and lead to predictions of
relativistic binary populations are also discussed. We discuss the current
observational evidence for cataclysmic variables, millisecond pulsars, and
low-mass X-ray binaries as well as possible future detection of relativistic
binaries with gravitational radiation.

position of the radio pulsar B1951+32 relative to nearby background radio
sources at four epochs between 1989 and 2000. These data show a clear motion
for the pulsar of (25 +/- 4) milliarcsec/yr at a position angle (252 +/- 7)
degrees (north through east), corresponding to a transverse velocity (240 +/-
40) km/s for a distance to the source of 2 kpc. The measured direction of
motion confirms that the pulsar is moving away from the center of its
associated supernova remnant, the first time that such a result has been
demonstrated. Independent of assumptions made about the pulsar birth-place, we
show that the measured proper motion implies an age for the pulsar of (64 +/-
18) kyr, somewhat less than its characteristic age of 107 kyr. This discrepancy
can be explained if the initial spin period of the pulsar was (27 +/- 6) ms.

form a complete description of the triaxial density profiles of halos in Cold

particularly useful in predicting a variety of nonsphericity effects, to a
reasonably reliable degree, including the weak and strong lens statistics, the
orbital evolution of galactic satellites and triaxiality of galactic halos, and
the non-linear clustering of dark matter. In addition, this provides a useful
framework for the non-spherical modeling of the intra-cluster gas, which is
crucial in discussing the gas and temperature profiles of X-ray clusters and
the Hubble constant estimated via the Sunyaev -- Zel'dovich effect.

that ``lensed'' density perturbations from other branes serve as possible seeds
for structure formation on our observable brane (without inflation), and, in
addition, provide constraints on braneworld scenarios with warped bulk
geometry. Due to the warped bulk metric, any perturbation generated on one
brane (or in the bulk matter) appears to an observer on a second brane to have
a significantly different amplitude. We analyze lensed perturbations in the
Randall-Sundrum type scenarios and the ``shortcut metric'' scenarios. For
Lorentz violating metrics in the bulk, we find the attractive possibility that
large density fluctuations that are causally produced elsewhere can lead to
small density fluctuations on our brane on superhorizon (acausal) length
scales, as required by structure formation. Our most interesting result is that
the ``shortcut metrics'' in which geodesics traverse the extra dimensions
provide an alternative to inflation with two important features: a possible
solution to the horizon problem and a mechanism to generate perturbations
necessary for structure formation.

phase of rotating AGB stars. Due to differential rotation, protons are mixed
into C12-rich layers after thermal pulses, in the course of the so called third
dredge up episode. We follow the time evolution of key isotope abundances in
the relevant layers with a post-processing code which includes time dependant
mixing and nucleosynthesis. In rotating AGB models, the mixing persists during
the entire interpulse phase due to the steep gradient of angular velocity at
the envelope-core interface. As the layers containing protons and C12, which
are formed this way, become hotter, a C13-pocket is formed in a natural way.
However, in this situation also N14 is formed and spread over the entire
C13-pocket. We include the neutron consuming N14(n,p) reaction in our network
and determine to what extent it reduces the production of trans-iron elements.
We propose that rotation may be responsible for the spread of efficiencies of
the C13 neutron source as required by observations.

infrared radiation from a dusty torus. The jet/disk symbiosis modifies the
energetics in the central parsec of AGN such that for a given accretion rate, a
powerful jet would occur at the expense of the disk luminosity, and
consequently the disk would less efficiently ionize the BRL clouds or heat the

the differences between the case where the X-ray source is in the form of a

radiative heating via Comptonization together with heating via photo-absorption
on numerous heavy elements as carbon, oxygen, silicon, iron. The transfer in
lines is precisely calculated. A better description of the heating/cooling
through the inclusion of line transfer, a correct description of the
temperature in the deeper layers, a correct description of the entire disc
vertical structure, as well as the study of the possible coronal pressure

exact calculations of hydrostatic equilibrium and determination of the disc
thickness has a crucial impact on the optical depth of the hot illuminated

radiation flux. A highly ionized skin is created in the lamp post model, with
the outgoing spectrum containing many emission lines and ionization edges in
emission or absorption in the soft X-ray domain, as well as an iron line at

either drastic revision of our astrophysical understanding, or new physics

local supercluster in order to avoid excessive energy losses through photopion
production on the cosmic microwave background. However they do not point back
towards possible nearby sources, e.g. the active galaxy Cen A or M87 in the
Virgo cluster, so such an astrophysical origin requires intergalactic magnetic
fields to be a hundred times stronger than previously believed, in order to
isotropise their arrival directions. Alternatively the primaries may be high
energy neutrinos, say from distant gamma-ray bursts, which annihilate on the
local relic background neutrinos to create ``Z-bursts''. A related possibility
is that the primary neutinos may initiate the observed air showers directly if
their interaction cross-sections are boosted to hadronic strength through
non-perturbative physics such as TeV-scale quantum gravity. Or the primaries
may instead be new strongly interacting neutral particles with a longer mean
free path than nucleons, coming perhaps from distant BL-Lac objects or FR-II
radio galaxies. Yet another possibility is that Lorentz invariance is violated
at high energies thus suppressing the energy loss processes altogether. The
idea that has perhaps been studied in most detail is that such cosmic rays
originate from the decays of massive relic particles (``wimpzillas'') clustered
as dark matter in the galactic halo. All these hypotheses will soon be
critically tested by the Pierre Auger Observatory, presently under construction
in Argentina, and by proposed satellite experiments such as EUSO.

Independently of mediation mechanism of supersymmetry breaking, infrared
convergence property of SCFTs can provide an interesting solution to

decoupling scale of SCFTs and eventually become degenerate to some degree,
thanks to family-independent radiative corrections governed by the SM gaugino
masses. We discuss under what conditions the degeneracy of sfermion mass can be
estimated in a simple manner. We also discuss the constraints from lepton
flavor violations. We then study explicitly sfermion mass degeneracy within the
framework of grand unified theories coupled to SCFTs. It is found that the
degeneracy for right-handed sleptons becomes worse in the conventional SU(5)
model than in the MSSM. On the other hand, in the flipped SU(5) \times U(1)
model, each right-handed lepton is still an SU(5)-singlet, whereas the bino
mass M_1 is determined by two independent gaugino masses of SU(5) \times U(1).
These two properties enable us to have an improved degeneracy for the

smooth projective threefold, $\E$ a rank-two vector bundle on $X$, $L$ a very
ample line bundle on $X$ and $k \geq 0$, $\delta >0 $ integers and denoted by
$V= {\V}_{\delta} ({\E} \otimes L^{\otimes k})$ the subscheme of
${\Pp}(H^0({\E} \otimes L^{\otimes k}))$ parametrizing global sections of ${\E}
\otimes L^{\otimes k}$ whose zero-loci are irreducible and $\delta$-nodal
curves on $X$, we present a new cohomological description of the tangent space
$T_{[s]}({\V}_{\delta} ({\E} \otimes L^{\otimes k}))$ at a point $[s]\in
{\V}_{\delta} ({\E} \otimes L^{\otimes k})$. This description enable us to
determine effective and uniform upper-bounds for $\delta$, which are linear
polynomials in $k$, such that the family $V$ is smooth and of the expected
dimension ({\em regular}, for short). The almost-sharpness of our bounds is
shown by some interesting examples. Furthermore, when $X$ is assumed to be a
Fano or a Calaby-Yau threefold, we study in detail the regularity property of a
point $[s] \in V$ related to the postulation of the nodes of its zero-locus
$C_s =C \subset X$. Roughly speaking, when the nodes of $C$ are assumed to be
in general position either on $X$ or on an irreducible divisor of $X$ having at
worst log-terminal singularities or to lie on a l.c.i. and subcanonical curve
in $X$, we find upper-bounds on $\delta$ which are, respectively, cubic,
quadratic and linear polynomials in $k$ ensuring the regularity of $V$ at
$[s]$. Finally, when $X= \Pt$, we also discuss some interesting geometric
properties of the curves given by sections parametrized by $V$.

group of the ambient manifold and often map onto infinitely generated groups.
The knot invariants generalize the cyclic (type 1) invariants of Kirk and
Livingston and when taken with respect to certain preferred knots, called
spherical knots, relative self-linking numbers are characterized geometrically
as the complete obstruction to the existence of a singular concordance which
has all singularities paired by Whitney disks. This geometric equivalence
relation, called W-equivalence, is also related finite type-1 equivalence (in
the sense of Habiro and Goussarov) via the work of Conant and Teichner and
represents a `first order' improvement to an arbitrary singular concordance.
For null-homotopic knots, a slightly weaker geometric equivalence relation is
shown to admit a group structure.

this we mean that it is still possible to make arbitrary number of copies of a
state which has {\it exactly} the same information content as the original
unknown coherent state. By making use of this {\it perfect information cloning}
it would be possible to estimate the original state through measurements and
make arbitrary number of copies of the estimator. We define the notion of a
{\em Measurement Fidelity}. We show that this information cloning gives rise,
in the case of $1\to N$, to a {\em distribution} of {\em measurement
fidelities} whose average value is ${1\over 2}$ irrespective of the number of
copies originally made. Generalisations of this to the $M\to MN$ case as well
as the measurement fidelities for Gaussian cloners are also given.

and ciphers. Encryption and decryption are carried out via an appropriate
measurement process on entangled states as governed by a quantum mechanical,
asymmetrical and dynamical public key distribution. The use of public keys
leads to a high availability of our scheme, while their quantum nature is shown
to ensure unconditional security of the proposed algorithm.

processes of life on the basis of fundamental laws of physics. It is emphasised
that viewing biological processes as manipulation of information extracts their
essential features. This information processing can be analysed using
well-known methods of computer science. The lowest level of biological
information processing, involving DNA and proteins, is the easiest one to link
to physical properties. Physical underpinnings of the genetic information that
could have led to the universal language of 4 nucleotide bases and 20 amino
acids are pointed out. Generalisations of Boolean logic, especially features of
quantum dynamics, play a crucial role.

mechanics when both are formulated in a C*-algebraic framework. By using finite
von Neumann algebras, a quantum mechanical analogue of Liouville's theorem is
then proposed. We proceed to study Poincare recurrence in C*-algebras by
mimicking the measure theoretic setting. The results are interpreted as
recurrence in quantum mechanics, similar to Poincare recurrence in classical
mechanics.
