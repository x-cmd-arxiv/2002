of this protogalaxy. We observe an enhancement of the alpha/Fe-peak ratios of
+0.2 dex for various elements, a marked odd-even effect in Mn, and a strong
underabundance of N relative to Si and S, [N/Si,S]=-1 at [Si/H]=-0.86. All of
these ratios support an environment that is in an early evolutionary stage,
where the onset of star formation has begun only shortly before the DLA was
observed. We also perform a cloud-by-cloud analysis -- without precedent at
high redshift -- and find a tight correlation of all low-ionization species
with respect to FeII extending over 2.5 orders of magnitude in N(FeII). We
interpret this trend as being due to homogeneous physical conditions (very mild
ionization effects, common dust-destruction histories, same chemical
composition) and propose that this line of sight encounters absorbing clouds
that share a common environment. In addition, photoionization models show that
these single clouds are shielded from the external ionizing radiation, so the
fraction of ionized gas is small and, except for argon, does not influence the
measured metal abundances. The observed AlIII/low-ion ratios suggest the mildly
ionized gas occurs in shells surrounding neutral cores of AlII.

brightest one being the 77x60 pc shell in NGC 5471B. The Ha velocity profile of
NGC 5471B can be decomposed into a narrow component (FWHM = 41 km/s) from the
background HII region and a broad component (FWHM = 148 km/s) from the SNR
shell. Using the brightness ratio of the broad to narrow components and the Ha
flux measured from the WFPC2 Ha image, we derive an Ha luminosity of
(1.4+-0.1)x10^39 ergs/s for the SNR shell. The [SII]6716,6731 doublet ratio of
the broad velocity component is used to derive an electron density of ~700
cm^-3 in the SNR shell. The mass of the SNR shell is thus 4600+-500 Mo. With a
\~330 km/s expansion velocity implied by the extreme velocity extent of the
broad component, the kinetic energy of the SNR shell is determined to be
5x10^51 ergs. This requires an explosion energy greater than 10^52 ergs, which
can be provided by one hypernova or multiple supernovae. Comparing to SNRs in
nearby active star formation regions, the SNR shell in NGC 5471B appears truly

history predicted by stellar evolution. The influence of the external ISM is
also taken into account. We find that the wind variations associated with the
thermal pulses lead to the formation of transient shells with an average
lifetime of 20,000 yr, and consequently do not remain recorded in the density
or velocity structure of the gas. The formation of shells that survive at the
end of the AGB occurs via two main processes: shocks between the shells formed
by two consecutive enhancements of the mass-loss or via continuous accumulation
of the material ejected by the star in the interaction region with the ISM. Our
models show that the mass of the circumstellar envelope increases appreciably
due to the ISM material swept up by the wind (up to 70 % for the 1 Msun stellar
model). We also point out the importance of the ISM on the deceleration and
compression of the external shells. According to our simulations, large regions
(up to 2.5 pc) of neutral gas surrounding the molecular envelopes of AGB stars

nonlinear fluid equations are approximated by an infinite set of oscillators

indirectly to the unstable r-mode. All couplings in this paper involve the

Uranium 238 is very near to the age of the solar system is not considered a
coincidence since there are many nuclides with half lives ranging over a huge
range of time scales implying that there is likely to be some nuclide with a
half life near to any given time scale. Likewise it may be that the vacuum
field energy causing the universal acceleration today is just one of a large
ensemble of scalar field energies, which have dominated the Universe in the
past and then faded away. Given that in standard cosmology and particle physics
there are already several scalar fields that probably contribute to universal
vacuum energy (the Higgs field, the inflaton, and whatever quintessence/dark
energy field causes the current acceleration), the idea of a large ensemble of
fields does not seem far fetched. Predictions of the idea include: 1) The
current vacuum energy driving the acceleration is not constant and will
eventually fade away, 2) The ratio w of scalar field pressure to density is
currently changing and is not precisely negative one, 3) There were likely
periods of vacuum dominance and acceleration in the past, 4) the current phase
of acceleration will end but there may be additional periods of acceleration in
the future, 5) the ultimate fate of the Universe cannot be decided until the
nature of these fields is known, but the eventual sum of densities from all
scalar fields could be zero, as was usually assumed before the discovery of the

  uniaxial compression tests","2 pages, 2 figures","poudres & grains 13(1) 4-5, (2002)",,,"cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  This paper is concerned with the trends of stress fluctuations in dry
granular materials as functions of the sample size D and of the grain diameter
d. Results are obtained in the plateau regime of large axial deformation,
during axi-symmetric uni-axial compression. Two cases have to be distinguished
depending on whether the material generates or does not generate stick-slip.
When no stick-slip is generated (Fig.1), it is found that the relative stress
fluctuations dq/q of the deviatoric stress q scales linearly with the ratio d/D
>. The coefficient A relating dq/q and d/D ranges from 1 to 3 about, depending
on the grain size d; this is probably due to the effect of the piston
roughness. This result is compatible with a contact force network with a random
force distribution and a short range correlation length L,i.e. L<3d; this leads
to estimate the representative elementary volume REV to contain few grains
(from 1 to 30) as it has been defended already in [1].
  We turn now to cases exhibiting stick-slip (Fig. 2). It has been shown in [2]
that the distribution of delays between events is rather ""exponential"" when the
sample is small, and Gaussian-like when the sample is larger. The cross-over
between the random to quasi periodic regime occurs for a typical sample which
contains 10 000 000 grains [2]. In this paper we show an analogy between the
statistics of stick-slip amplitude Dq/q and the seismicity of the Los Angeles
area during 1979-1997 period [3]. Similarity of the two trends is quite
surprising. The seismicity has been cut off at Magnitude M=3.5.
  These results have to be handled with care since similarity may be
fortuitous.

all previous conjectures for the (extrapolated) critical behaviour, although
they in general agree well with previous simulations wherever they can be
directly compared. Instead, they suggest that scaling laws observed in previous
simulations are spurious, and that the density $\rho$ of trees in the critical
state was grossly underestimated. While previous simulations gave $\rho\approx
0.408$, we conjecture that $\rho$ actually is equal to the critical threshold

the densities reachable with present day computers, and we estimate that we

density of microions at the cell boundary. We show that the range of validity
of linearization depends strongly on the linearization point and proof that
expansion about the selfconsistently determined average potential is optimal in
several respects. For instance, screening inside the suspension is
automatically described by the actual ionic strength, resulting in the correct
asymptotics at high colloid concentration. Together with the analytical
solution of the linear PB equation for cell models of arbitrary dimension and
electrolyte composition explicit and very general formulas for the osmotic

substitutes upto x=0.30 into the MgB2 lattice. The superconducting transition
temperature, TC measured both by zero resistivity and the onset of the

upto x=0.30, beyond which the volume fraction decreases drastically. The
temperature dependence of resistivity in the normal state fits to the
Bloch-Gruneisen formula for all the carbon compositions studied. The Debye
temperatures, extracted from the fit is seen to decrease with carbon content
from 900K to 525K, whereas the electron-phonon interaction parameter, obtained
from the McMillan equation using the measured TC and the Debye temperature, is
seen to increase monotonically from 0.8 in MgB2 to 0.9 in the x=0.50 sample.
The ratio of the resistivities between 300K and 40K versus TC is seen to follow
the Testardi correlation for the C substituted samples. The decrease in TC is
argued to mainly arise due to large decrease in the Debye temperature with C
concentration and a decrease in the hole density of states at N(EF).

between a divergent integral over bosonic moduli and a vanishing integral over
fermionic moduli. The one-instanton contribution to such Wilson loops is
explicitly evaluated in semi-classical approximation. The method utilizes the
symmetries of the problem to perform the integration over the bosonic and
fermionic collective coordinates of the instanton. The integral is singular for
small instantons touching the loop and is regularized by introducing a cutoff
at the boundary of the (euclidean) AdS_5 moduli space. In the case of a
circular loop a nonzero finite result is obtained when the cutoff is removed
and a perimeter divergence subtracted. This is contrasted with the case of the
straight line where the result is zero after subtraction of an identical
divergence per unit length. The linear divergence is an artifact of our non
supersymmetric regulator that deserves further consideration. The
generalization to gauge group SU(N) with arbitrary N is straightforward in the

one dimensional (in space) damped dispersive nonlinear PDE based on mechanics
and phenomenology of hearing. It describes the motion of basilar membrane (BM)
in the cochlea driven by input pressure waves. Both elastic damping and
selective longitudinal fluid damping are present. The former is nonlinear and
nonlocal in BM displacement, and plays a key role in capturing tonal
interactions. The latter is active only near the exit boundary (helicotrema),
and is built in to damp out the remaining long waves. The initial boundary
value problem is numerically solved with a semi-implicit second order finite
difference method. Solutions reach a multi-frequency quasi-steady state.
Numerical results are shown on two tone suppression from both high-frequency
and low-frequency sides, consistent with known behavior of two tone
suppression. Suppression effects among three tones are demonstrated by showing
how the response magnitudes of the fixed two tones are reduced as we vary the
third tone in frequency and amplitude. We observe qualitative agreement of our
model solutions with existing cat auditory neural data. The model is thus
simple and efficient as a processing tool for voice signals.

intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) in isolated molecules
has a heirarchical tier structure. The tier structure implies strong
correlations between the energy level motions of a quantum system and its
intensity-weighted spectrum. A measure, which explicitly accounts for this
correaltion, was first introduced by one of us as a sensitive probe of phase
space localization. It correlates eigenlevel velocities with the overlap
intensities between the eigenstates and some localized state of interest. A
semiclassical theory for the correlation is developed for systems that are
classically integrable and complements earlier work focusing exclusively on the
chaotic case. Application to a model two dimensional effective spectroscopic
Hamiltonian shows that the correlation measure can provide information about
the terms in the molecular Hamiltonian which play an important role in an
energy range of interest and the character of the dynamics. Moreover, the
correlation function is capable of highlighting relevant phase space structures
including the local resonance features associated with a specific bright state.
In addition to being ideally suited for multidimensional systems with a large
density of states, the measure can also be used to gain insights into the phase
space transport and localization. It is argued that the overlap intensity-level
velocity correlation function provides a novel way of studying vibrational
energy redistribution in isolated molecules. The correlation function is
ideally suited to analyzing the parametric spectra of molecules in external
fields.

shown to be stable for Klein--Gordon chains with soft on--site potentials and
repulsive dispersive interaction, and with hard on--site potentials and
attractive dispersive interactions. At higher coupling dark breathers lose
their stability via subharmonic, harmonic or oscillatory bifurcations,
depending on the model. However, most of these bifurcations are harmless in the

disappear when the system is infinite. Dark breathers in dissipative systems

"quant-ph/0202013","Navin Khaneja","Navin Khaneja and Steffen Glaser","Spin Solitons and Quantum Control of Spin Chain Dynamics",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  Experiments in coherent spectroscopy correspond to control of quantum
mechanical ensembles guiding them from initial to final target states by
unitary transformations. The control inputs (pulse sequences) that accomplish
these unitary transformations should take as little time as possible so as to
minimize the effects of relaxation and to optimize the sensitivity of the
experiments. Here, we present a radically different and generally applicable
approach to efficient control of dynamics in spin chains of arbitrary length.
The approach relies on the creation of localized spin waves, ``spin solitons'',
and efficient propagation of these soliton states through the spin chain. The
methods presented are expected to find immediate applications in control of
spin dynamics in coherent spectroscopy and quantum information processing.
