that the observable universe, u0, constitutes a Universal Turing Machine (UTM)
constrained by algorithmically random logical tape parameters defining its
material properties (a physical UTM). The finite non-zero empirical values of
Planck's constant, h, and other constants of nature exemplify those logical
parameters. Their algorithmic randomness is necessary and sufficient for the
consistent operation of a physical UTM. At any given time, ti, these constants
correspond to the first n random halt digits, Omega-n, of Chaitin's Halting
Probability, Omega. Planck's equation E=hv and Boltzmann's relation S=kLogW are
shown to apply to the operation of a physical UTM. The genomic evolution of u0
in constants of nature space (CON space) from an undecidable state in u0's
Planck era to its current ordered condition occurs through the algorithmically
random, symmetry-breaking addition of new constants to the laws by which u0
operates -- a process called logical tunneling. The temperature of u0 for t<=tp
is shown to be T=0K. The energy dissipated when a physical UTM clears its
memory after each computation is proposed as a candidate for cold dark matter
(CDM) and is calculated to comprise 87.5% of the cosmological matter content,
Omega-M, of u0. This result concurs with current astronomical estimates that
87.1% of the matter content of u0 consists of CDM. The energy incorporated in
u0 through the process of logical tunneling from undecidable states of the
complete Universe, E, to decidable states of u0 is suggested as a candidate for
the unexplained ""dark energy"", Omega-X, hypothesized to drive the accelerating
cosmological expansion of space and believed to constitute 66% of the critical
mass, Omega-0, of the observable universe.

exhibit nonmonotonic dependence on the thickness d_f of the F layer. SF systems
have been studied for a long time; according to the experimental situation, the
""dirty"" limit is often considered which implies that the mean free path in the
layers is the second smallest spatial scale after the Fermi wavelength.
However, all calculations reported for the dirty limit were done with some
additional assumptions, which can be violated in actual experiments. Therefore,
we develop a general method (to be exact, two independent methods) for
investigating T_c as a function of the bilayer's parameters in the dirty case.
Comparing our theory with experiment, we obtain good agreement. In the general
case, we observe three characteristic types of T_c(d_f) behavior: 1)
nonmonotonic decay of T_c to a finite value exhibiting a minimum at particular
d_f, 2) reentrant behavior, characterized by vanishing of T_c in a certain
interval of d_f and finite values otherwise, 3) monotonic decay of T_c and
vanishing at finite d_f. Qualitatively, the nonmonotonic behavior of T_c(d_f)
is explained by the interference of quasiparticles in the F layer, which can be
either constructive or destructive depending on the value of d_f.

  Under the Direction of Robert Brooks",,,,"math.DG",,"  In this thesis we consider a way to construct a rich family of compact
Riemann Surfaces in a combinatorial way. Given a 3-regualr graph with
orientation, we construct a finite-area hyperbolic Riemann surface by gluing
triangles according to the combinatorics of the graph. We then compactify this
surface by adding finitely many points.
  We discuss this construction by considering a number of examples. In
particular, we see that the surface depends in a strong way on the orientation.
  We then consider the effect the process of compactification has on the
hyperbolic metric of the surface. To that end, we ask when we can change the
metric in the horocycle neighbourhoods of the cusps to get a hyperbolic metric
on the compactification. In general, the process of compactification can have
drastic effects on the hyperbolic structure. For instance, if we compactify the
3-punctured sphere we lose its hyperbolic structure.
  We show that when the cusps have lengths > 2\pi, we can fill in the horocycle
neighbourhoods and retain negative curvature. Furthermore, the last condition
is sharp. We show by examples that there exist curves arbitrarily close to
horocycles of length 2\pi, which cannot be so filled in. Such curves can even
be taken to be convex.

locally and obtain corollaries about their projective dimensions and torsion

spontaneously determining its own rule for time evolution, function dynamics
(FD) is analyzed. FD consists of a functional equation with a self-referential
term, given as a dynamical system of a 1-dimensional map. Through the time
evolution of this system, a dynamical graph (a network) emerges. This graph has
three interesting properties: i) vertices appear as stable elements, ii) the
terminals of directed edges change in time, and iii) some vertices determine
the dynamics of edges, and edges determine the stability of the vertices,
complementarily. Two aspects of FD are studied, the generation of a graph
(network) structure and the dynamics of this graph (network) in the system.

broken as a result of quantization. Although most manifestations of this
phenomenon are in the context of quantum field theory, there are at least two

article we discuss the physics of the latter together with experimental
consequences.
