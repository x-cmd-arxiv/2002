of the former two lines, contrary to the general belief, we found that in six

additional excitation mechanism, but the presence of OI $\lambda$7774 in one of
the objects suggests that collisional ionization may have an important role in
the formation of OI $\lambda$8446. The usefulness of the OI lines as a reliable

E(B-V) derived from the OI $\lambda 1304/\lambda$8446 ratio agree with those
obtained using other reddening indicators. The observations point toward a
break in the one-to-one photon relation between OI $\lambda$8446 and OI

  stars in the Hyades -- Are Stars Polluted?","submitted to AJ",,"10.1086/340809",,"astro-ph",,"  Hipparcos parallaxes and proper motions have made it possible to construct
Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagrams of nearby clusters with unprecedented
accuracy. The standard deviation of high fidelity non-binary non-variable stars
about a model stellar evolution isochrone in the Hyades cluster is about 0.04
magnitudes. We use this deviation to estimate an upper limit on the scatter in
metallicities in stars in this cluster. From the gradient of the isochrones
evolution in the HR diagram we estimate an upper limit for the scatter of
metallicities Delta [Fe/H] <~ 0.03 dex, a smaller limit than has been measured
previously spectroscopically. This suggests that stars in open clusters are
formed from gas that is nearly homogeneous in its metallicity. We consider the
hypothesis that processes associated with planet formation can pollute the
convection zone of stars. If the position on the HR diagram is insensitive to
the metallicity of the convection zone and atmosphere, then stars which have
very polluted convection zones can be identified from a comparison between
their metallicity and position on the HR diagram. Alternatively if the
pollution of the star by metals results in a large change in the position of
the star on the HR diagram in a direction perpendicular to the isochrone, then
the low scatter of stars in the Hyades can be used to place constraints on
quantity of high-Z material that could have polluted the stars.

a nonrelativistic reverse shock, both for spherical and collimated outflows, is
presented as an example of the general theory. External shock model fits for
the afterglow lead to the conclusion that GRB outflows are jetted. The external
shock model also explains the temporal duration distribution and clustering of
peak energies in prompt spectra of long-duration GRBs, from which the redshift
dependence of the GRB source rate density can be derived. Source models are
reviewed in light of the constant energy reservoir result of Frail et al. that
implies a total GRB energy of a few times 10^{51} ergs and an average beaming
fraction of ~1/500 of full sky. Paczynski's isotropic hypernova model is ruled
out. The Vietri-Stella model two-step collapse process is preferred over a
hypernova/collapsar model in view of the X-ray observations of GRBs and the
constant energy reservoir result. Second-order processes in GRB blast waves can
accelerate particles to ultra-high energies. GRBs may be the sources of UHECRs

modeled as the sum of four Lorentzians, which describe distinct broad noise
components. Before 1998 July, Cyg X-1 was in a ""quiet"" hard state characterized
primarily by the first three of these broad Lorentzians. Around 1998 May, this
behavior changed: the total fractional rms amplitude decreased, the peak
frequencies of the Lorentzians increased, the average time lag slightly
increased, and the X-ray spectrum softened. The change in the timing parameters
is mainly due to a strong decrease in the amplitude of the third Lorentzian.
Since then, an unusually large number of X-ray flares have been observed.
During these ""failed state transitions"", the X-ray power spectrum changes to
that of the intermediate state. Modeling this PSD with the four Lorentzians, we
find that the first Lorentzian component is suppressed relative to the second

significantly. We confirm the interpretation as failed state transitions with
observations from the 2001 Jan. and 2001 Oct. soft states. Such behavior
suggests that some or all of the Lorentzian components are associated with the

high (though not very high) rates is believed to proceed adiabatically ({\em
ie} non-radiatively). It is argued that the liberated energy is carried off by
an outflow, probably involving almost all of the gas that is supplied. Two
dimensional, fluid, accretion disks, in which mass, angular momentum and energy
are transported to the disk surface, are summarized. It is conjectured that
relatively minor changes are needed to describe magnetised disks. By contrast,
the disk surface physics is argued to dictate the character of the outflow. 2.
Ultrarelativistic jets appear to be produced by active galactic nuclei (AGN),
pulsars and $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRB). In all three cases, it is argued that
the power is generated electromagnetically by a magnetic rotator, (in a DC not
AC form), and transported in this manner to the emission site. A model of a
relativistically expanding electromagnetic shell is described and used to
provide a simple model of a GRB in which the $\gamma$-rays are produced by
unstable electrical currents flowing along the rotation axis. The shell drives
a relativistic blast wave into the surrounding medium with a speed that varies
with latitude and whose afterglow emission may exhibit achromatic breaks.
Similar processes may be at work in non-relativistic plerions like the Crab
Nebula and, possibly, AGN jets. The observational implications of these two
classes of model and the prospects for performing instructive, numerical
experiments to elucidate them further are briefly outlined.

Electromagnetic flows are naturally anisotropic and self-collimating so as to
produce jet-like features. The relativistic force-free description of these
flows, which is simpler than the relativistic MHD description, is explained. It
is suggested that the magnetic field associated with AGN jets and GRB is quite
extensively distributed in latitude, without necessarily increasing by much the
total power. It is also proposed that the observed emission from these sources
traces out regions of high current density where global instabilities drive a
turbulence spectrum that is ultimately responsible for the particle
acceleration and the synchrotron, inverse Compton and synchro-Compton emission.
The direct extraction of spin energy from a black hole is re-examined and an
electromagnetic model of GRB explosions is developed. It is also suggested that
some GRB ``lighthouses'' be identified with accretion-induced collapse of a
neutron star to form a black hole in a binary system.

destruction of the merging dwarf. We also demonstrate that spatial
distribution, total number, and metallicity distribution of the clusters formed

the orbital configuration of merging. Based on these results, we discuss

drives disk evolution. Deep inside the bar, two massive molecular spirals cover
nearly 180 degrees in azimuth, show streaming motions of 20--40 km/s and feed a
starburst ring of super star clusters at 375 pc. They also connect to two
narrow K-band spirals which delineate the UV-bright star clusters in the ring.
The data suggest that the K-band spirals are young, and the starburst has been
triggered by a bar-driven spiral density wave (SDW). The latter may even have
propagated closer to the center where a second Halpha ring and a dust spiral
are found. The molecular and HST data support a scenario where stellar winds
and supernovae efficiently clear out gas from dense star-forming regions on
timescales less than a few Myrs. We have investigated the properties of massive
CO spirals within the framework of bar-driven SDWs, incorporating the effect of
gas self-gravity. We find good agreement between the model predictions and the
observed morphology, kinematics, and pitch angle of the spirals. This
combination of observations and modeling provides the best evidence to date for
a strong dynamical coupling between the nuclear region and the surrounding
disk. It also confirms that a low central mass concentration, which may be
common in late-type galaxies, is particularly favorable to the propagation of a
bar-driven gaseous SDW deep into the central region of the galaxy, whereas a
large central mass concentration favors other processes, such as the formation
and decoupling of nuclear bars.

experiments mapping large fraction of the sky. Accurate CMB measurements ask
for multi-feed array instruments observing the sky with a redundant scanning

different detectors for a better control of systematic effects. We investigate
here the capability to suppress 1/f noise features in Time Ordered Data (TOD)
by using the destriping technique described in Maino et al. (1999), under
realistic assumptions for crossing condition between different scan circles and
sky signal fluctuations on small angular scales. We consider as working case,
Planck-LFI simulated observations with few arminutes pixel size convolved with
LFI beam resolutions. We also extend the analysis to high values of the
knee-frequency and found a residual additional noise rms ~31% larger than the
pure white noise rms at fk=1 Hz which could be a critical issue in the
extraction of the CMB angular power spectrum. Furthermore we verified that
destriping quality does not significantly depend on the receiver sensitivity
whereas it improves proportionally to the improvement of sampling rate.
Therefore given a noise level, the higher the sampling rate, the better the
destriping quality.

examined. The matter content of the model is assumed to be comoving dust plus a
positive cosmological constant. The model presents a critical point of
saddle-center-center type in the finite region of phase space. This critical
point engenders in the phase space dynamics the topology of stable and unstable
four dimensional tubes $R \times S^3$, where $R$ is a saddle direction and
$S^3$ is the manifold of unstable periodic orbits in the center-center sector.
A general characteristic of the dynamical flow is an oscillatory mode about
orbits of an invariant plane of the dynamics which contains the critical point
and a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) singularity. We show that a pair of
tubes (one stable, one unstable) emerging from the neighborhood of the critical
point towards the FRW singularity have homoclinic transversal crossings. The
homoclinic intersection manifold has topology $R \times S^2$ and is constituted
of homoclinic orbits which are bi-asymptotic to the $S^3$ center-center
manifold. This is an invariant signature of chaos in the model, and produces
chaotic sets in phase space. The model also presents an asymptotic DeSitter
attractor at infinity and initial conditions sets are shown to have fractal
basin boundaries connected to the escape into the DeSitter configuration
(escape into inflation), characterizing the critical point as a chaotic
scatterer.

currents and underlying conserved tensors is obtained for massless linear
symmetric spinor fields of any spin s>0 in four dimensional flat spacetime.
These results generalize the recent classification in the spin s=1 case of all
conserved currents locally constructed from the electromagnetic spinor field.
The present classification yields spin s>0 analogs of the well-known
electromagnetic stress-energy tensor and Lipkin's zilch tensor, as well as a
spin s>0 analog of a novel chiral tensor found in the spin s=1 case. The chiral
tensor possesses odd parity under a duality symmetry (i.e., a phase rotation)
on the spin s field, in contrast to the even parity of the stress-energy and
zilch tensors. As a main result, it is shown that every locally constructed
conserved current for each s>0 is equivalent to a sum of elementary linear
conserved currents, quadratic conserved currents associated to the
stress-energy, zilch, and chiral tensors, and higher derivative extensions of
these currents in which the spin s field is replaced by its repeated
conformally-weighted Lie derivatives with respect to conformal Killing vectors
of flat spacetime. Moreover, all of the currents have a direct, unified
characterization in terms of Killing spinors. The cases s=2, s=1/2 and s=3/2
provide a complete set of conserved quantities for propagation of gravitons
(i.e., linearized gravity waves), neutrinos and gravitinos, respectively, on
flat spacetime. The physical meaning of the zilch and chiral quantities is
discussed.

a coherent sheaf called the Frobenius or F-amplitude. As the terminology
indicates, the definition is most natural over a field of positive

theorem, and this leads to the problem of calculating, or at least estimating,
this number. Most of the work in this paper is devoted to doing this various
situations. The key result in this direction is a bound on the F-amplitude of
an ample vector bundle. When combined with the vanishing theorem, this has some
reasonably down to earth corollaries (both old and new).

of sectional genus 6,7 and 8. Based on this we show:
  1. The first geometric syzygies of a general canonical curve of genus 6 form
a non degenerate configuration of 5 lines in P^4.
  2. The first geometric syzygies of a general canonical curve of genus 7 form
a non degenerate, linearly normal, ruled surface of degree 84 on a spinor
variety S in P^15.
  3. The second geometric syzygies of a general canonical curve of genus 8 form
a non degenerate configuration of 14 conics on a 2-uple embedded P^5 in P^20.
  This proves a natural generalization of Green's conjecture [1984], namely
that the geometric syzygies should span the space of all syzygies, in these
cases. We have generalized results 1 and 3 to general curves of even genus in
math.AG/0108078. Result 2 is the main new result of this paper.

Analytic expressions of the mean velocity and of the velocity power spectrum
are presented. These show that above a threshold value of the field normal
diffusion is superimposed to ballistic motion. The diffusion constant can be
given explicitly. At the threshold field the transition between conduction and
localization is accompanied by an anomalous diffusion. Our results exemplify
that, even in the absence of time-dependent stochastic forces, a purely

of the ground-state form factor of a two-body system made of scalar particles
interacting via the exchange of a scalar boson. The aim is to provide an
uncertainty range on methods employed in implementing these effects as well as
an insight on their relevance when an ``exact'' calculation is possible. Using
a wave function corresponding to a mass operator that has the appropriate
properties to construct the generators of the Poincar\'{e} algebra in the
framework of relativistic quantum mechanics, form factors are calculated using
the boost transformations pertinent to the instant, front and point forms of
this approach. Moderately and strongly bound systems are considered with masses
of the exchanged boson taken as zero, 0.15 times the constituent mass $m$, and
infinity. In the first and last cases, a comparison with ``exact'' calculations
is made (Wick-Cutkosky model and Feynman triangle diagram). Results with a
Galilean boost are also given. Momentum transfers up to $Q^2=100 m^2$ are
considered. Emphasis is put on the contribution of the single-particle current,
as usually done. It is found that the present point-form calculations of form
factors strongly deviate from all the other ones, requiring large contributions
from two-body currents. Different implementations of the point-form approach,
where the role of these two-body currents would be less important, are
