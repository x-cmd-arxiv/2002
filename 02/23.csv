  Galaxy emission below 3000 Angstroms directly correlates with actual star
formation, not depending on the total mass of the system. A straightforward
calibration is obtained, in this sense, from the theoretical models at 1600,
2000 and 2800 Angstroms, and a full comparison is carried out with IUE data and
other balloon-borne observations for local galaxies.
  The claimed role of late-type systems as prevailing contributors to the
cosmic UV background is reinforced by our results; at 2000 Angstroms Im
irregulars are found in fact nearly four orders of magnitude brighter than
ellipticals, per unit luminous mass.
  The role of dust absorption in the observation of high-redshift galaxies is
assessed, comparing model output and observed spectral energy distribution of
local galaxy samples. Similar to what we observe in our own galaxy, a quick
evolution in the dust environment might be envisaged in primeval galaxies, with
an increasing fraction of luminous matter that would escape the regions of
harder and ""clumpy"" dust absorption on a timescale of some 10^7 yr, comparable
with the lifetime of stars of 5-10 solar masses.

model in an attempt to calculate the temporal variability of SiO maser emission
in the circumstellar envelope (CE) of a model AGB star. This study investigates
whether the variations in local physical conditions brought about by shocks are
the predominant contributing factor to SiO maser variability because, in this
work, the radiative part of the pump is constant. We find that some aspects of
the variability are not consistent with a pump provided by shock-enhanced
collisions alone. In these simulations, gas parcels of relatively enhanced SiO
abundance are distributed in a model CE by a Monte Carlo method, at a single
epoch of the stellar cycle. From this epoch on, Lagrangian motions of
individual parcels are calculated according to the velocity fields encountered
in the model CE during the stellar pulsation cycle. The potentially masing gas
parcels therefore experience different densities and temperatures, and have
varying line-of-sight velocity gradients throughout the stellar cycle, which
may or may not be suitable to produce maser emission. At each epoch (separated
by 16.6 days), emission lines from the parcels are combined to produce
synthetic spectra and VLBI-type images. We report here the results for v=1,

U II at 3859 A in the spectrum of BD +17^\circ 3248, which makes this the

of the XRB can be explained if most of the AGN are heavily absorbed, and in

well-described by disk emission near a Schwarzschild black hole, confirming the
results of earlier analyses on the ASCA 1994 and 1997 data. The time-resolved
iron-line profile is remarkably stable over a factor of three change in source
flux, and the line and continuum fluxes are uncorrelated. Detailed fits to the
variable iron-line profile suggest that the active region (parametrized by the
best-fit inner and outer radii of the accretion disk) responsible for iron line
emission actually narrows with increasing flux to a region around 4--5 r_g. In
contrast to the iron line, the power-law continuum exhibits significant
variability during the 1999 observation. Time-resolved spectral analysis
reveals a new feature in the well-known photon index (Gamma) vs. flux
correlation: Gamma appears to approach a limiting value of Gamma ~ 2.1 at high
flux. Two models are proposed to explain both the new feature in the Gamma vs.
flux correlation and the uncorrelated iron-line flux: a phenomenological two
power-law model, and the recently proposed ``thundercloud'' model of Merloni &
Fabian (2001). Both models are capable of reproducing the data well, but
because they are poorly constrained by the observed Gamma vs. flux relation,
they cannot at present be tested meaningfully by the data. The various
implications and the physical interpretation of these models are discussed.

EDM of the neutron and mercury atom are suppressed. In this framework,
epsilon_K can be saturated by a small non--universality of the soft scalar
masses through the gluino contribution. We perform a detailed analysis for the
supersymmetric contributions to epsilon'/epsilon. Although, the gluino
contribution is found to be negligible due to a severe cancellation between LR

accommodate the experimental results. Additionally, we find that the SUSY

\Delta I =3/2 operators are insignificant. We point out that the standard model
gives the leading contribution to the CP asymmetry in B -> \psi K_S decay,

theory, adaptive control, system identification, etc. This paper characterizes
the strictly positive real regions in coefficient space and presents a robust
design method for SPR transfer functions. We first introduce the concepts of
SPR regions and weak SPR regions and show that the SPR region associated with a
fixed polynomial is unbounded, whereas the weak SPR region is bounded. We then
prove that the intersection of several weak SPR regions associated with
different polynomials can not be a single point. Furthermore, we show how to
construct a point in the SPR region from a point in the weak SPR region. Based
on these theoretical development, we propose an algorithm for robust design of
SPR transfer functions. This algorithm works well for both low order and high
order polynomial families. Illustrative examples are provided to show the
effectiveness of this algorithm.

reactions in laboratory experiments can be well represented in terms of a
constant shift of the tunneling potential barrier as postulated in all previous
analyses if the electronic cloud were static or structureless and lied outside

of a simple two-level coupled-channels problem, we suggest that there could
occur a strong quantum transition of electrons from excited to the ground
states in the tunneling region, leading to a spatially dependent screening
potential. We thus show the necessity of the dynamical treatment of the
tunneling region in order to properly assess the screening effects by bound
target electrons in low energy nuclear reactions in laboratories.

constitutes the simplest nontrivial Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The present
paper develops the tools needed to understand the nature of the complete J=0
energy spectrum for this prototype system, assuming a sum of two-body
potentials. The resulting spectrum is calculated as a function of the two-body
scattering length a_sc, which documents the evolution of certain many-body
levels that evolve from BEC-type to molecular-type as the scattering length is
decreased. Implications for the behavior of the condensate excited-state
spectrum and for condensate formation and decay are elucidated. The energy
levels evolve smoothly, even through the regime where the number of two-body
bound states N_b increases by 1, and a_{sc} switches from -infinity to
infinity. We point out the possibility of suppressing three-body recombination
by tuning the two-body scattering length to values that are larger than the
size of the condensate ground state. Comparisons with mean-field treatments are
presented.
