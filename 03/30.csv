present here exact expressions which are valid for primordial spectra of
arbitrary shape and which allow accurate numerical calculations. We then
consider the possibility to have a significant part of dark matter in the form
of PBHs produced by a primordial spectrum of inflationary origin possessing a
characteristic scale. We show that in this model the relevant PBH mass is
constrained to lie in the range $5\times 10^{15} {\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim
10^{21} {\rm g}$. This is much less than the mass range coming from the QCD
phase transition, allowing the two mechanisms to be easily distinguished.

other ETCs in general showing the limits to which they are bound and the

metallicity evolution of damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) and find a
reasonable agreement with observations. In particular, the observed slow
evolution of the DLA metallicity occurs naturally in the simulation due to the
combined effects of physical and observational selection. The slow metallicity
evolution is caused by the steady transformation, with increasing time, of the
highest metallicity systems to ""galaxies"", thus depleting this category, while
all the lower metallicity systems show, individually, an increase in
metallicity. Although the trend of DLA metallicity with redshift is in good
agreement with observations, it appears that the average metallicity of
simulated DLAs is higher than observed by 0.3-0.5 dex in the probed redshift
range (z=0-5). Our study indicates that this difference may be attributed to
observational selection effects due to dust obscuration. If we allow for a dust
obscuration effect, our model reproduces the observed metallicity evolution in
both amplitude and slope. We find that DLAs are not a simple population but
probe a range of different systems and the mix changes with redshift. About 50%
of all metals in the gaseous phase is in DLAs at all times from z=5 to z=1,
making a rapid downturn at z\le 1 to ~20% by z=0, as metals are swept into the
hotter components of the IGM as well as locked up in stars. While not the
primary focus of this study, we find that the model provides good matches to
observations with respect to column density distribution and evolution of
neutral gas content, if the same dust obscuration is taken into account. We
find Omega_{DLA,comp}=(1-3)E-3, depending on the effect of dust obscuration.

to a predicted distribution of planets that is a steeply rising function of log
(a), where a is the orbital radius. Between 1 AU and 3 AU, the expected number
of planets per logarithmic interval in orbital radius roughly doubles. We
demonstrate that, once selection effects are accounted for, this is consistent
with current data, and then extrapolate the observed planet fraction to masses
and radii that are inaccessible to current observations. In total, about 15
percent of stars targeted by existing radial velocity searches are predicted to
possess planets with masses 0.3 M_Jupiter < M_p sin (i) < 10 M_Jupiter, and
radii 0.1 AU < a < 5 AU. A third of these planets (around 5 percent of the
target stars) lie at the radii most amenable to detection via microlensing. A
further 5-10 percent of stars could have planets at radii of 5 AU < a < 8 AU
that have migrated outwards. We discuss the probability of forming a system
(akin to the Solar System) in which significant radial migration of the most
massive planet does not occur. About 10-15 percent of systems with a surviving
massive planet are estimated to fall into this class. Finally, we note that a
smaller fraction of low mass planets than high mass planets is expected to
survive without being consumed by the star. The initial mass function for
planets is thus predicted to rise more steeply towards small masses than the
observed mass function.

fluid elements in orbit around a gravitational well. Since inertial
accelerations play a fundamental dynamical role in the process, one may expect
substantial modifications by strong gravity in the case of accretion on to a
black hole. In this paper, we develop a fully covariant, Lagrangian
displacement vector field formalism with the aim of addressing these issues for
a disk embedded in a stationary geometry with negligible radial flow. This
construction enables a transparent connection between particle dynamics and the
ensuing dispersion relation for MHD wave modes. The MRI--in its incompressible
variant-- is found to operate virtually unabated down to the marginally stable
orbit; the putative inner boundary of standard accretion disk theory. To get a
qualitative feel for the dynamical evolution of the flow below $r_{\rm ms}$, we
assume a mildly advective accretion flow such that the angular velocity profile
departs slowly from circular geodesic flow. This exercise suggests that the
turbulent eddies will occur at spatial scales approaching the radial distance
while tracking the surfaces of null angular velocity gradients. The implied
field topology, namely large-scale horizontal field domains, should yield
strong mass segregation at the displacement nodes of the non-linear modes when
radiation stress dominates the local disk structure (an expectation supported
by quasi-linear arguments and by the non-linear behavior of the MRI in a
non-relativistic setting). Under this circumstance, baryon-poor flux in
horizontal field domains will be subject to radial buoyancy and to the Parker
instability, thereby promoting the growth of poloidal field.

line transfer in a supershell of neutral hydrogen which are expanding radially

velocity of $V_exp = 300 km/s, and the turbulence of b=40 km/s. We find that
there appear a few emission peaks at the frequencies corresponding to (2N-1)
V_exp, where the order of back scatterings N > 1. As V_exp -> b, the emergent
profiles become similar to those for the static medium and the peaks are less
prominent. We also investigate the effects of column density of the supershell
on the emergent Lya profiles. We find that the number and the flux ratios of
emission peaks are determined by interplay of $\tau_0$ and V_exp of the
supershell. We discuss the effects of dust extinction and the implication of
our works in relation to recent spectroscopic observations of starburst

dustless, and thick plane-parallel slab that is uniformly filled with neutral
hydrogen. Because the scattering phase function is characterised by the dipole
type for wing scatterings of Lya, which is in high contrast with more isotropic
scattering phase function associated with resonant scatterings, the
polarisation of the emergent Lya is dominantly controlled by the number of wing
scatterings before escape from the slab. When the scattering medium is
extremely thick, photons emergent in the grazing direction are polarised in the
direction perpendicular to the slab normal up to 12%, which coincides with the
limit attained by the Thomson scattered radiation in a semi-infinite thick
medium investigated by Chandrasekhar in 1960. The number of wing scatterings
before escape is sensitively dependent on the product of the Voigt parameter
$a$ and the line-centre optical depth $\tau_0$, with which the variation of the
degree of polarisation can also be explained in comparison with the Thomson
scattering case. The polarisation direction is parallel to the slab normal when
$a\tau_0<10^3$, while it is perpendicular when $a\tau_0>10^3$. Our simulated
spectropolarimetry of Lya from a highly thick medium is characterised by
negligible polarisation around the line centre, parallel polarisation in the
near wing parts and perpendicular polarisation in the far wing parts, where the
polarisation direction is measured with respect to the slab normal. The
polarisation flip naturally reflects the diffusive nature of the Lya transfer
process in both real space and frequency space. We also discuss the beaming
effect that is associated with the parallel polarisation in the near wing parts
of the emission.

factors that shape the properties of an interacting electron system. For
example, the onsite Coulomb repulsion, U, may inhibit, or completely block the
intersite electron hopping, t, and depending on the ratio U/t, a material may
be a metal or an insulator. The correlation effects increase as the number of
allowed dimensions decreases. In 3D systems, the low energy electronic states
behave as quasiparticles (QP), while in 1D systems, even weak interactions
break the quasiparticles into collective excitations. Dimensionality is
particularly important for a class of new exotic low-dimensional materials
where 1D or 2D building blocks are loosely connected into a 3D whole. Small
interactions between the blocks may induce a whole variety of unusual
transitions. Here, we examine layered systems that in the direction
perpendicular to the layers display a crossover from insulating-like, at high
temperatures, to metallic-like character at low temperatures, while being
metallic over the whole temperature range within the layers. We show that this
change in effective dimensionality correlates with the existence or
non-existence of coherent quasiparticles within the layers.

means that a singularity in the Einstein-frame manifold maps to a regular
surface S_(trans) in the Jordan frame, and the solution is then continued
beyond this surface. S_(trans) can be an ordinary regular sphere or a horizon.
In the second case, S_(trans) proves to connect two epochs of a Kantowski-Sachs

functions $U(\phi)$, the list of possible types of causal structures of vacuum
space-times is the same as in general relativity with a cosmological constant.
This is true even for conformally continued solutions. It is found that when

which the rho, omega, and phi vector meson pole contributions evolve at high
momentum transfer to conform to the predictions of perturbative QCD (pQCD), was
recently extended to include the width of the rho meson by substituting the
result of dispersion relations for the pole and the addition of rho' (1450)
isovector vector meson pole. This extended model was shown to produce a good
overall fit to all the available nucleon electromagnetic form factor (emff)
data. Since then new polarization data shows that the electric to magnetic
ratios R_p and R_n obtained are not consistent with the older G_{Ep} and G_{En}
data in their range of momentum transfer. The model is further extended to
include the omega' (1419) isoscalar vector meson pole. It is found that while
this GKex cannot simultaneously fit the new R_p and the old G_{En} data, it can
fit the new R_p and R_n well simultaneously. An excellent fit to all the
remaining data is obtained when the inconsistent G_{Ep} and G_{En} is omitted.
The model predictions are shown up to momentum transfer squared, Q^2, of 8
GeV^2/c^2.

  http://astro.uchicago.edu/home/web/young",,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.ao-ph physics.geo-ph",,"  We study the weakly non-linear development of shear-driven gravity waves, and
investigate the mixing properties of the finite amplitude solutions.
Calculations to date have been restricted to the linear theory, which predicts
that gravity waves are amplified by an influx of energy through the critical
layer, where the velocity of the wind equals the wave phase velocity. Because
of the presence of a critical layer, ordinary weakly non-linear methods fail;
in this paper, we use a rescaling at the critical layer and matched asymptotics
to derive an amplitude equation for the most unstable wave, under the
simplifying assumption that the physical domain is periodic. These amplitude
equations are solved numerically, in their quasi-steady limit, for the cases of
small density ratio (applicable to oceanography), and for arbitrary density
ratio but strong stratification (for more general physical/astrophysical
situations). In addition to the familiar asymptotic growth found in other
inviscid flow, we find that, for the air over water case (provided the maximum
wind velocity is in the range of $0.2\mpers \sim 1\mpers$), the single mode
transitions from exponential to algebraic growth when the amplitude of the wave
is as small as $h\sim 10^{-5}\lambda$; hence, it may be difficult to observe
the linear regime for this case in numerical simulations. We also find that the
weakly non-linear flow allows for super-diffusive particle transport with an
exponent $\sim 3/2$, consistent with Venkataramani's results.

wings with FWHM $\sim 4.5 cm^{-1}$ in the absorption spectra of polyatomic
molecules in a gas phase are presented. Two independent experimental methods
were used for evaluating the integral intensity of the line wings for a number
of substances. In the first case, the cross--section of the far wings of
absorption bands in a gas phase spectrum were measured. Then, these band wings
were extrapolated inside the contour of absorption band. In the second case,
the saturation degree of the linear spectrum of molecules was determined.
Radiation of a pulsed $CO_2$--laser was used at low gas pressure ($\sim 16$
mtorr) and averaged excitation level of molecules ${<n>}\sim 0.1$
quanta/molecule. The values obtained by these two independent methods coincide
for a variety of molecules. The average relative integral intensity of the line
wings varied from $\sim 0.6%$ for $SF_6$ and $SiF_4$ to $\sim 90%$ for
$(CF_3)_2O$ and $(CF_3)_2CO$.

temperature. In a close encounter, 11.5 kyr ago, tidal forces deformed the
Earth. While the shape of the gyroscope Earth relaxed, the North Pole moved
geographically from Greenland to its present position. During this close
encounter, the object was torn to pieces, each of which subsequently evaporated
or plunged into the sun. These events terminated the Ice Age Epoch.

Alternatively, there are nonlinear dynamical extensions that treat mixed states
as {\it elementary mixtures} and evolve {\it every}pure state linearly and
unitarily. But if all {\it entangled} pure states evolve linearly, then
elementary mixtures cannot evolve nonlinearly without challenging quantum
locality. Conversely, any such extension that is relativistically well behaved
demands a nonlinear evolution [decoherence] of pure entangled states. Wherefrom
follows that the linear evolution of entangled pure states provides an
unequivocal signature of linear quantum dynamics.

the physical literature as an argument of the essential distinction between the
probability relations under quantum and classical measurements, is not, as it
is usually considered, in contrast to the rule for the addition of
probabilities of incompatible events. The latter is, of course, valid under all
measurement situations upon classical and quantum objects. We discuss also
quantum measurement situation, which is similar to the classical one,
corresponding to classical Bayes' formula for conditional probabilities. We
show the compatibility of description of this quantum measurement situation in
the frame of purely classical and experimentally justified straight ward
frequency arguments [Khrennikov (1999, 2000, 2001)] and in the frame of the
quantum stochastic approach to the description of generalized quantum
measurements (Loubenets (2000); Barndorff-Nielsen and Loubenets (2001)]. In
view of derived results, we argue that even in the classical probability the
classical Bayes' formula describes a particular case of the considered
measurement situation, which is specific for context-independent measurements.
The similarity of the forms of the relation between the transformation of
probabilities, which we derive in the frame of quantum stochastic approach and
in the frame of straight ward frequency arguments, underlines once more that
the projective (von Neumann) measurements correspond only to a very special
kind of measurement situations in quantum theory.
