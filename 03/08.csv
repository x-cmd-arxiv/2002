with the period predicted at the time of that observation, finding that the
phase is consistent. The value of the spin down rate, here measured for the
first time, is \approx 10^{-14} s/s and can not be explained in terms of
propeller or torque from a fossil disk. When interpreted in terms of dipolar
losses, it gives a magnetic field of B \approx 10^{13} G, making also
implausible that the source is accreting from the underdense surroundings. We
discuss the implications of this measure for the different mechanisms that have
been suggested to explain the X-ray emission. We conclude that the observed
properties are more compatible with a scenario in which the source is \approx
10^6 yrs old, and its magnetic field has not changed substantially over the
lifetime.

Methods that rely upon a determination of the coordinate distance to

assumptions about the clustering properties of matter, or the evolution of this
clustering.
  Two of the methods currently being used to determine the coordinate distance
to high-redshift sources are the radio galaxy method and the supernova method.
These methods are similar in their dependence on the coordinate distance. Here,
the radio galaxy method is briefly described and results are presented. One of
the underlying assumptions of the method is explored. In addition, the method
is compared and contrasted to the supernova method. The constraints imposed on
global cosmological parameters by radio galaxies are consistent with those
imposed by supernovae.
  For a universe that is spatially flat with mean mass density $\Omega_m$ in
non-relativistic matter and mean mass density 1- $\Omega_m$ in quintessence,
radio galaxies alone indicate at 84 % confidence that the expansion of the
universe is accelerating at the current epoch. And, independent of whether or
not the universe is spatially flat, radio galaxies alone indicate at 95 %
confidence that $\Omega_m$ must be less than 0.6 at the current epoch.

several classes of close binary systems including Algols, W Ursae Majoris and
RS Canum Venaticorum systems, and the cataclysmic variables. The origin of
these changes is unknown, but mass loss, apsidal motion, magnetic activity, and
the presence of a third body have all been proposed. In this paper we use new
CCD observations and the century-long historical record of the times of primary
eclipse for WW Cygni to explore the cause of these period changes. WW Cygni is
an Algol binary whose orbital period undergoes a 56 year cyclic variation with
an amplitude of approximately 0.02 days. We consider and reject the hypotheses
of mass transfer, mass loss, apsidal motion and the gravitational influence of
an unseen companion as the cause for these changes. A model proposed by
Applegate, which invokes changes in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the
convective and rotating secondary star, is the most likely explanation of this
star's orbital period changes. This finding is based on an examination of WW
Cygni's residual O-C curve and an analysis of the period changes seen in 66
other Algols. Variations in the gravitational quadrupole moment are also
considered to be the most likely explanation for the cyclic period changes
observed in several different types of binary systems.

models for the formation of structures in the early Universe, as it requires
that the black holes would grow so massive in less than a billion years after
the Big Bang. Here we show that up to a third of known quasars with z~6 will
have their observed flux magnified by a factor of 10 or more through
gravitational lensing by galaxies along the line of sight. The inferred
abundance of quasar host galaxies, as well as the luminosity density provided

Matching the halo abundance to the observed luminosity function requires
knowing the relation between the virial mass and luminosity (separately for
early and late type galaxies) and the fraction of galaxies that reside in
larger halos such as groups and clusters, all of which can be extracted from
the galaxy-galaxy lensing. We apply the recently derived values from SDSS and
find Omega_m(n_eff+3)= (0.15 \pm 0.05)/(1-f_dh), where f_dh accounts for the

major advantage of our comparison is that distances in our sample are known
with good accuracy, while tests that involve open and globular clusters are
constrained by potentially inaccurate distances. We show that the luminosity of
the lower main sequence relative to a fiducial (solar metallicity) isochrone is
a simple function of metallicity: $\Delta M_V = 0.84375 \times {\rm [ Fe/H]} -
0.04577$. We compare the data with a range of isochrones from the literature.
None of the models fit all the data, although some models do clearly better
than others. In particular, metal rich isochrones seem to be difficult to
construct.
  The relationship between luminosity, colour and metallicity for K dwarfs is
found to be very tight. We are thus able to derive metallicities for K dwarfs
based on their position in the Hipparcos colour-magnitude diagram with
accuracies better than 0.1 dex. The metallicity-luminosity relation for K

derive an IMF for the Trapezium Cluster that rises with decreasing mass, having
a Salpeter-like IMF slope until near ~0.6 M_sun where the IMF flattens and
forms a broad peak extending to the hydrogen burning limit, below which the IMF
declines into the sub-stellar regime. Independent of the details, we find that
sub-stellar objects account for no more than ~22% of the total number of likely
cluster members. Further, the sub-stellar Trapezium IMF breaks from a steady
power-law decline and forms a significant secondary peak at the lowest masses
(10-20 times the mass of Jupiter). This secondary peak may contain as many as
\~30% of the sub-stellar objects in the cluster. Below this sub-stellar IMF
peak, our KLF modeling requires a subsequent sharp decline toward the planetary
mass regime. Lastly, we investigate the robustness of pre-main sequence

that the micro-pulse width in pulsars has a period dependence. Like individual
pulses, Vela's micro-pulses are highly elliptically polarized. There is a
strong correlation between Stokes parameters V and I in the micro-structure. We
show that the V/I distribution is Gaussian with a narrow width and that this
width appears to be constant as a function of pulse phase. The phase-resolved
intensity distributions of I are best fitted with log-normal statistics. Extra
emission components, i.e.``bump'' and ``giant micro-pulses'', discovered by
Johnston et al.(2001) are also present at 2.3 GHz. The bump component seems to
be an extra component superposed on the main pulse profile but does not appear
periodically. The giant micro-pulses are time-resolved and have significant
jitter in their arrival times. Their flux density distribution is best fitted
by a power-law, indicating a link between these features and ``classical''
giant pulses as observed for the Crab pulsar, (PSR B0531+21), PSR B1937+21 and

atmospheres in order to correct for the influence of the photospheric

presence of temperature inhomogeneities as a consequence of the non-linear
temperature dependence of the line opacity. For many lines of practical

interpolation in the tables and graphs provided with this paper. The
application of abundance corrections may often be an acceptable alternative to
a detailed fitting of individual line profiles based on hydrodynamical

physical processes near the surface of rotation powered pulsars. We model the
actual magnetic field as the sum of global dipolar and star-centered multipolar
fields. In configurations involving axially symmetric and uniform multipolar
fields, 'neutral points' and 'neutral lines' exist close to the stellar
surface. Also, the curvature radii of magnetic field lines near the stellar
surface can never be smaller than the stellar radius, even for very high order
multipoles. Consequently, such configurations are unable to provide an
efficient pair creation process above pulsar polar caps, necessary for plasma
mechanisms of generation of pulsar radiation. In configurations involving
axially symmetric and non-uniform multipoles, the periphery of the pulsar polar
cap becomes fragmented into symmetrically distributed narrow sub-regions where
curvature radii of complex magnetic field lines are less than the radius of the
star. The pair production process is only possible just above these
'favourable' sub-regions. As a result, the pair plasma flow is confined within
narrow filaments regularly distributed around the margin of the open magnetic
flux tube. Such a magnetic topology allows us to model the system of twenty
isolated sub-beams observed in PSR B0943+10 by Deshpande & Rankin (1999, 2001).
We suggest a physical mechanism for the generation of pulsar radio emission in
the ensemble of finite sub-beams, based on specific instabilities. We propose

Survey (MDS). Our measurement method and treatment of systematic effects were
discussed in an earlier paper. We measure the shear variance on scales ranging
from 0.7' to 1.4', with a detection significance greater than 3.8. This allows
us to measure the normalization of the matter power spectrum to be sigma8 =
(0.94 +/- 0.10 +/- 0.14) (0.3/Omega_m)^0.44 (0.21/Gamma)^0.15, in a LCDM
universe. The first 1sigma error includes statistical errors only, while the
latter also includes (gaussian) cosmic variance and the uncertainty in the
galaxy redshift distribution. Our results are consistent with earlier cosmic
shear measurements from the ground and from space. We compare our cosmic shear
results and those from other groups to the normalization from cluster abundance
and galaxy surveys. We find that the combination of four recent cosmic shear
measurements are somewhat inconsistent with the recent normalization using
these methods, and discuss possible explanations for the discrepancy.

several models of interest for financial time series. The six measures of
dependence are respectively the linear correlation $\rho^+_v$ and Spearman's
rho $\rho_s(v)$ conditioned on signed exceedance of one variable above the
threshold $v$, or on both variables ($\rho_u$), the linear correlation
$\rho^s_v$ conditioned on absolute value exceedance (or large volatility) of
one variable, the so-called asymptotic tail-dependence $\lambda$ and a
probability-weighted tail dependence coefficient ${\bar \lambda}$. The models
are the bivariate Gaussian distribution, the bivariate Student's distribution,
and the factor model for various distributions of the factor. We offer explicit
analytical formulas as well as numerical estimations for these six measures of
dependence in the limit where $v$ and $u$ go to infinity. This provides a
quantitative proof that conditioning on exceedance leads to conditional
correlation coefficients that may be very different from the unconditional
correlation and gives a straightforward mechanism for fluctuations or changes
of correlations, based on fluctuations of volatility or changes of trends.
Moreover, these various measures of dependence exhibit different and sometimes
opposite behaviors, suggesting that, somewhat similarly to risks whose adequate
characterization requires an extension beyond the restricted one-dimensional
measure in terms of the variance (volatility) to include all higher order
cumulants or more generally the knowledge of the full distribution,
tail-dependence has also a multidimensional character.

will exhibit mean-field critical behavior, i.e., critical behavior not affected

critical behavior asymptotically close to the critical point is determined by
fluctuations and the actual critical behavior depends on the particular
universality class. A variety of systems, including fluids and anisotropic
ferromagnets, belongs to the three-dimensional Ising universality class. Recent
numerical studies of Ising models with different interaction ranges have
revealed a spectacular crossover between the asymptotic fluctuation-induced
critical behavior and mean-field-type critical behavior. In this work, we
compare these numerical results with a crossover Landau model based on
renormalization-group matching. For this purpose we consider an application of
the crossover Landau model to the three-dimensional Ising model without fitting
to any adjustable parameters. The crossover behavior of the critical
susceptibility and of the order parameter is analyzed over a broad range (ten
orders) of the scaled distance to the critical temperature. The dependence of
the coupling constant on the interaction range, governing the crossover
critical behavior, is discussed

Casimir energy naturally plays the role of dark energy, which decreases in time

exponents are anomalous, showing a clear deviation from the dimensional
prediction. Dimensional scaling is subleading and it is recovered only after a
random reshuffling of all velocity phases, in the stationary ensemble. This
supports the idea that anomalous scaling is the result of a genuine inertial
evolution, independent of large-scale behavior.

atomistic detail at different compositions at two different temperatures. We
investigate the influence of polymer concentration on the dynamics of the
solvent molecules and the structure of the solvation shell. The double bonds
along the polymer backbone are preferentially approached by the solvent
molecules. The mobility of cyclohexane molecules decreases with increasing
polymer concentration at ambient conditions. The reorientation of molecules
becomes more anisotropic with concentration as the polymer hinders the
reorientation of the molecular plane. At elevated temperatures the influence of
the polymer is weaker and the reorientation of the solvent is more isotropic.
Additionally, a fast and efficient way to set up atomistic simulations is shown
in detail in which the initial simulations increase in length and in the
simulation time-step. The excess energy from initial overlaps is removed by
resetting the velocities at regular intervals.

over the other N-m qudits. We examine the entanglement in the space of mixed
states of m qudits. We show that for a typical pure state of N qudits, its
subsystems smaller than N/3 qudits will have a positive partial transpose and
hence are separable or bound entangled. Additionally, our numerical results
show that the probability of finding entangled subsystems smaller than N/3

entanglement encompassing at least a third of the qudits in the pure state.
