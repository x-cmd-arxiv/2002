epoch, in order to learn how inflation influences the likely initial conditions
for quintessence. We use the stochastic inflation formalism to study quantum
fluctuations induced in the quintessence field during the early stages of
inflation, and conclude that these drive its mean to large values (> 0.1
m_{Planck}). Consequently we find that tracker behaviour typically starts at
low redshift, long after nucleosynthesis and most likely also after decoupling.

associated more closely with the visible narrow-line region than with the radio

the Seyfert nucleus. The velocity field and strength with respect to [Pa B] are
found to be consistent with this argument. The performance of the IFU is

post-starburst quasar UN J1025-0040, which contains both an active galactic
nucleus (AGN) and a 400-Myr-old nuclear starburst of similar bolometric
luminosity (10^{11.6} solar luminosities). The F450W and F814W images resolve
the AGN from the starburst and show that the bulk of the star light (6 x
10^{10} solar masses) is contained within a central radius of about 600
parsecs, and lacks clear morphological structures at this scale. Equating the
point-source light in each image with the AGN contribution, we determined the
ratio of AGN-to-starburst light. This ratio is 69% in the red F814W image,
consistent with our previous spectral analysis, but about 50% in the blue F450W
image whereas we had predicted 76%. The HST images are consistent with previous
photometry, ruling out variability (a fading AGN) as a cause for this result.
We can explain the new data if there is a previously unknown young stellar
population present, 40 Myr or younger, with as much as 10% of the mass of the
dominant 400-Myr-old population. This younger starburst may represent the
trigger for the current nuclear activity. The multiple starburst ages seen in
UN J1025-0040 and its companion galaxy indicate a complex interaction and
star-formation history.

address possible discrepancies between collisionless dark matter simulations

dark matter particles not only have strong self-interactions but also have
strong interactions with baryons. The presence of such interactions will have
direct implications for nuclear and particle astrophysics. Among these are a
change in the predicted abundances from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the
flux of gamma-rays produced by the decay of neutral pions which originate in
collisions between dark matter and Galactic cosmic rays (CR). From these
effects we constrain the strength of the baryon--dark matter interactions
through the ratio of baryon - dark matter interaction cross section to dark
matter mass, $s$. We find that BBN places a weak upper limit to this ratio $<
10^8 cm^2/g$. CR-SIDM interactions, however, limit the possible DM-baryon cross
section to $< 5 \times 10^{-3} cm^2/g$; this rules out an energy-independent
interaction, but not one which falls with center-of-mass velocity as $s \propto

fields of two GRBs at z=2.04 (GRB 000301C and GRB 000926). We find that the
host galaxy of GRB 000926 is an extended, strong Ly-alpha emitter with a
rest-frame equivalent width of 71+20-15 AA. The galaxy consists of two main
components and several fainter knots. GRB 000926 occurred in the western
component, whereas most of the Ly-alpha luminosity (about 65%) originates in
the eastern component. Using archival HST images of the host galaxy we measure
the spectral slopes (f_lambda prop. to lambda^beta) of the two components to
beta = -2.4+-0.3 (east) and -1.4+-0.2 (west). This implies that both components
contain at most small amounts of dust, consistent with the observed strong
Ly-alpha emission. The western component has a slightly redder V-I colour than
the eastern component, suggesting the presence of at least some dust. We do not
detect the host galaxy of GRB 000301C in neither Ly-alpha emission nor in U and
I-band images. We infer a limit of U(AB)>27.7 (2-sigma limit per arcsec^2). The
upper limits on the Ly-alpha flux implies a Ly-alpha equivalent width upper
limit of 150AA. We find 11 and 8 other galaxies with excess emission in the
narrow filter in the fields of GRB 000301C and GRB 000926 respectively. Based
on these detections we conclude that GRB 000926 occurred in one of the
strongest centres of star formation within several Mpc, whereas GRB 000301C
occurred in an intrinsically very faint galaxy far from being the strongest
centre of star formation in its galactic environment. Under the hypothesis that
GRBs trace star formation, the wide range of GRB host galaxy luminosities
implies a very steep faint end slope of the high redshift galaxy luminosity
function.

strong quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with amplitudes reaching about 0.3
mag. Our period analysis yielded a power spectrum with two peaks of QPOs, whose
center periods are 37.5+/-0.1 and 73.4+/-0.4 min and, furthermore, with a
significant power in frequencies lower than the QPOs. DW Cnc is a unique
cataclysmic variable in which kilo-second QPOs were continuously detected for
61 days. We propose two possible interpretations of DW Cnc: (i) A permanent
superhumper below the period minimum of hydrogen-rich cataclysmic variables.
(ii) A nova-like variable having an orbital period over 3 hours. In this case,
the QPOs may be caused by trapped disk oscillations.

and discuss twenty-three such objects and consider the implications of their

have discovered one BAL quasar with a record number of absorption lines. Two
other similarly complex objects with many narrow troughs show broad MgII
absorption extending longward of their systemic host galaxy redshifts. This can
be explained as absorption of an extended continuum source by the
rotation-dominated base of a disk wind. Five other objects have absorption
which removes an unprecedented ~90% of all flux shortward of MgII. The
absorption in one of them has varied across the ultraviolet with an amplitude
and rate of change as great as ever seen. This same object may also show broad
H-beta absorption. Numerous reddened BAL quasars have been found, including at
least one reddened mini-BAL quasar with very strong FeII emission. The five
reddest objects have continuum reddenings of E(B-V)~0.5, and in two of them we
find strong evidence that the reddening curve is even steeper than that of the
SMC. We have found at least one object with absorption from FeIII but not FeII.
This may be due to a high column density of moderately high-ionization gas, but
the FeIII level populations must also be affected by some sort of resonance.
Finally, we have found two luminous, probably reddened high-redshift objects

phase in 2D but an ordered phase can exist in 3D at low temperature. However,
our simulations yield spin stiffness exponents $\theta_{s} \approx -0.36$ in 2D
and $\theta_{s} \approx +0.31$ in 3D, which are considerably larger than
previous estimates and strongly suggest that the lower critical dimension is
less than three. For the $\pm J$ XY spin glass in 3D, we obtain a spin
stiffness exponent $\theta_{s} \approx +0.10$ which supports the existence of
spin glass order at finite temperature in contrast with previous estimates
which obtain $\theta_{s}< 0$. Our method also allows us to study
renormalization group flows of both the coupling constant and the disorder
strength with length scale $L$. Our results are consistent with recent analytic
and numerical studies suggesting the absence of a re-entrant transition in 2D
at low temperature. Some possible consequences and connections with real vortex
systems are discussed.

Because of the precession, the time-averaged interaction torque between s and S
vanishes. An interface between a magnetic layer and a spacer causes a local
coherence between the precession phases of differnt electrons, within 10 nm
from the interface, and restores the torque. Also, a second magnetic layer with
pinned S is used to prepare s in a specific direction. the current-induced
drive torque of s on S in the active layer may be calculated from the spin

Overall constant phase of the fermion generating functional. (II) Overall
constant coefficient of the fermion generating functional. (III) Fermion
propagator appearing in external fermion lines and the propagator connected to
Yukawa vertices. The first effect appears from the transformation of the path
integral measure and it is absorbed into a suitable definition of the constant
phase factor for each topological sector; in this sense there appears no ``CP
anomaly''. The second constant arises from the explicit breaking in the action
and it is absorbed by the suitable weights with which topological sectors are
summed. The last one in the propagator is inherent to this formulation and
cannot be avoided by a mere modification of the projection operator, for
example, in the framework of the Ginsparg-Wilson operator. This breaking
emerges as an (almost) contact term in the propagator when the Higgs field,
which is treated perturbatively, has no vacuum expectation value. In the
presence of the vacuum expectation value, however, a completely new situation
arises and the breaking becomes intrinsically non-local, though this breaking
may still be removed in a suitable continuum limit. This non-local CP breaking
is expected to persist for a non-perturbative treatment of the Higgs coupling.

self energy of a particle as the function of its position. Since the particle
wants to go to the region where its self energy is lower, it is repelled from
the brane to the bulk where it gains its 5D self energy. Cases when mass of the
particle $m<8\pi^2M_*$ and $m>8\pi^2M_*$ are qualitatively different, and in
later case one has to take into account effects of strong gravity. In both
cases the particle is repelled from the brane. For $m<8\pi^2M_*$ we obtain the
same result from the 'electrostatic' analog of the theory. In that language
mass (charge) in the bulk induces charge distribution on the brane which
shields the other side of the brane and provides repulsive force. The DGP brane
acts as a conducting plane in electrostatics (keeping in mind that in gravity
different charges repel). The repulsive nature of the brane requires a certain
localization mechanism. When the particle overcomes the localizing potential it
rapidly moves to the bulk. Particles of mass $m>8\pi^2M_*$ form a black hole
within $1/M_*$ distance from the brane.

  Plichko, Nova Science, New York, 2001, pp. 21-34",,,"math.FA math.GN",,"  Let X be a Banach space. Given a subset A of the dual space X* denote by
$A_{(1)}$ the weak* sequential closure of A, i.e., the set of all limits of
weak*-convergent sequences in A.
  The study of weak* sequential closures of linear subspaces of the duals of
separable Banach spaces was initiated by S.Banach. The first results of this
study were presented in the appendix to his book ""Theorie des operations
lineaires"" (1932).
  It is natural to suppose that the reason for studying weak* sequential
closures by S. Banach and S. Mazurkiewicz was the lack of acquaintance of S.
Banach and his school with concepts of general topology. Although the name
""General topology"" was introduced later, the subject did already existed. F.
Hausdorff introduced topological spaces in his book published in 1914,
Alexandroff-Urysohn (1924) studied compactness, and A.Tychonoff published his
theorem on compactness of products in 1929. Also J.von Neumann introduced the
notion of a weak topology in his paper published in 1929.
  Using the notions of a topological space and the Tychonoff theorem, more
elegant treatment of weak and weak* topologies, and the duality of Banach
spaces was developed by L.Alaoglu, N.Bourbaki and S.Kakutani (1938-1940).
  Nevertheless, an ""old-fashioned"" treatment of S.Banach still attracts
attention. It happens because the ""sequential"" approach is very useful in
several contexts.
  The main purpose of the paper is to describe the history of this direction of
research and to give an up-to-date (1999) survey of the results on weak*
sequential closures and their applications.

fibering over the circle we introduce an real quadratic number field K with

idea is to relate geometry of M to the arithmetic of field K. On this way, we
show that Vol M is a limit density of ideals of given norm in the field K
(Dirichlet density). The second statement says that the number of cusp points
of manifold M is equal to the class number of the field K. It is remarkable
that both of the invariants can be explicitly calculated for the concrete
values of discriminant d. Our approach is based on the K-theory of
noncommutative C*-algebras coming from measured foliations and geodesic
laminations studied by Thurston et al. We apply the elaborated technique to
solve the Poincare conjecture for given class of manifolds.

intersection in the projective space and and $Z$ is a simple normal crossing
divisor in $X$ whose irreducible components are smooth hypersurface sections on
$X$. Our Jacobian rings give an algebraic description of the cohomology of the
open complement $X-Z$ and it is a natural generalization of the Poincar\'e
residue representation of the cohomology of a hypersurface originally invented
by Griffiths. The main results generalize the Macaulay's duality theorem and
the Donagi's symmetrizer lemma for usual Jacobian rings for hypersurfaces. A
feature that distinguishes our generalized Jacobian rings from usual ones is
that there are instances where duality fails to be perfect while the defect can
be controlled explicitly by using the defining equations of $Z$ in $X$. Two
applications of the main results are given: One is the infinitesimal Torelli
problem for open complete intersections. Another is an explicit bound for
Nori's connectivity in case of complete intersections. The results have been
applied also to study of algebraic cycles in several other works.

fields with an SU(2) symmetry, helicity and the new third-order invariant
originate from the same identity, an identity which relates the second Chern
class and the Chern-Simons three-form. We present an explicit example of three
magnetic fields with non-disjunct support. These fields, derived from a vacuum
Yang-Mills field with a non-vanishing winding number, possess a third-order
linkage detected by our invariant.

presented, allowing secure direct communication from one party to another
without the need for a shared secret key. Since the information is transferred
in a deterministic manner, no qubits have to be discarded and every qubit
carries message information. The security of the transfer against active and
passive eavesdropping attacks is provided. The detection rate of active attacks
is at least 25%. The protocol works with a quantum efficiency of 1 bit per
qubit transmitted.

  During Twisted Rapid Passage with Possible Application to Quantum Computing","29 pages, 16 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.68.052314","SIUC-Phys-02-03-14","quant-ph",,"  In an adiabatic rapid passage experiment, the Bloch vector of a two-level
system (qubit) is inverted by slowly inverting an external field to which it is
coupled, and along which it is initially aligned. In twisted rapid passage, the
external field is allowed to twist around its initial direction with azimuthal
angle $\phi (t)$ at the same time that it is inverted. For polynomial twist:
$\phi (t) \sim Bt^{n}$. We show that for $n \geq 3$, multiple avoided crossings
can occur during the inversion of the external field, and that these crossings
give rise to strong interference effects in the qubit transition probability.
The transition probability is found to be a function of the twist strength $B$,
which can be used to control the time-separation of the avoided crossings, and
hence the character of the interference. Constructive and destructive
interference are possible. The interference effects are a consequence of the
temporal phase coherence of the wavefunction. The ability to vary this
coherence by varying the temporal separation of the avoided crossings renders
twisted rapid passage with adjustable twist strength into a temporal
interferometer through which qubit transitions can be greatly enhanced or
suppressed. Possible application of this interference mechanism to construction
of fast fault-tolerant quantum CNOT and NOT gates is discussed.
