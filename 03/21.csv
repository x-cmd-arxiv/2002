such binaries could play a critical role in calibrating the single-star stellar

estimated spectral type, we infer metallicity-dependent Teffs from a minimizing
method fitting the B-V, V-R and V-I colours. For this purpose, a grid of
621,600 flux distributions were computed from the Basel Stellar Library (BaSeL
2.2) of model-atmosphere spectra, and their theoretical colours compared with
the observed photometry. As a matter of fact, the BaSeL colours show a very
good agreement with the BVRI metallicity-dependent empirical calibrations of
Alonso et al. (1996), temperatures being different by 3+-3 % in the range
4000-8000 K for dwarf stars. Before deriving the metallicity-dependent Teff
from the BaSeL models, we paid particular attention to the influence of
reddening and stellar rotation. A comparison between the MExcess code and
neutral hydrogen column density data shows a good agreement for the sample but
we point out a few directions where the MExcess model overestimates the E(B-V)
colour excess. Influence of stellar rotation on the BVRI colours can be
neglected except for 5 stars with large vsini, the maximum effect on
temperature being less than 5%. Our final results are in good agreement with
previous spectroscopic determinations available for a few primary components,
and with ten Brummelaar et al. below ~10,000 K. Nevertheless, we obtain an
increasing disagreement with their Teffs beyond 10,000 K. Finally, we provide a

a narrow iron line (as observed by Chandra) a broad component with sigma=0.72

radiative shocks created where the supernova blast wave strikes dense gas
protruding inward from the equatorial ring. We measure and tabulate line
identifications, fluxes and, in some cases, line widths and shifts. We compute
flux correction factors to account for substantial interstellar line absorption
of several emission lines. Nebular analysis shows that optical emission lines
come from a region of cool (T_e ~ 10^4 K) and dense (n_e ~ 10^6 cm^-3) gas in
the compressed photoionized layer behind the radiative shock. The observed line
widths indicate that only shocks with shock velocities V_s < 250 km/s have
become radiative, while line ratios indicate that much of the emission must
have come from yet slower (V_s < 135 k/ms) shocks. We are able to fit the UV
fluxes with an idealized radiative shock model consisting of two shocks (V_s =
135 and 250 km/s). The observed UV flux increase with time can be explained by
the increase in shock surface areas as the blast wave overtakes more of the
protrusion. The observed flux ratios of optical to highly-ionized UV lines are
greater by a factor of ~ 2 -- 3 than predictions from the radiative shock
models and we discuss the possible causes. We also present models for the
observed H-alpha line widths and profiles, which suggests that a chaotic flow
exists in the photoionized regions of these shocks. We discuss what can be

inner-shell collisional ionization (CI), in addition to the usual contribution
of collisional excitation (CE). These additional processes enhance mostly the
2p-3s lines and not the 2p-3d lines. Under coronal equilibrium conditions, in
the electron temperature range of 400 to 600 eV where the Fe XVII line
emissivities peak, the combined effect of the additional processes is to
enhance the 2p-3s lines at 16.78, 17.05, and 17.10 A, by ~ 25%, 30%, and 55%,
respectively, compared with their traditional, single-ion CE values. The weak
2p-3d line at 15.45 A is also enhanced by up to 20%, while the other 2p-3d
lines are almost unaffected. The effects of DR and RE are found to be dominant
in this temperature range (400 - 600 eV), while that of CI is 3% at the most,
and the contribution of RR is less than 1%. At lower temperatures, where the Fe
XVII / Fe XVIII abundance ratio is high, the RE effect dominates. However, as
the temperature rises and the Fe XVIII abundance increases, the DR effect takes
over.
  The newly calculated line powers can reproduce most of the often observed
high values of the (I17.05 + I17.10) / I15.01 intensity ratio. The importance

easy incorporation of incompleteness (a function of not only magnitude and
color, but also radius), photometry errors and biases, and a variety of other
complex effects into the calculation, instead of the more common procedure of
attempting to correct for those effects.
  We then apply this procedure to our NGC 3627 data from Paper I. We find that
we are able to successfully model the observed CMRD and constrain a number of
parameters of the cluster population. We measure a power law mass function
slope of alpha = -1.50 +/- 0.07, and a distribution of core radii centered at

spectroscopic observations of the bright Be star Pi Aquarii. Observational data
collected from the literature were used to study the star's variations over the
last four decades. The star is identified with the IR sources F22227+0107 in
the IRAS Faint Point Source catalog and MSX5_G066.0066-44.7392 in the MSX
catalog. The variations in near-IR brightness of Pi Aqr are found to be among
the largest reported for Be stars. Since 1996, the star has shown only weak
signs of circumstellar emission, which has allowed us to refine the fundamental
stellar parameters: A_V=0.15 mag., T_eff=24000K, log g=3.9, and M_V=-2.95 mag.
A weak emission component of the H-alpha line has been detected during the
recent quasi-normal star phase. From analysis of the H-alpha line profiles, we
find anti-phased radial velocity variations of the emission component and the
photospheric absorption, with a period of 84.1 days and semi-amplitudes of
101.4 and 16.7 km/s, respectively. This result suggests that Pi Aqr may be a
binary system consisting of stars with masses of M_1 sin^{3}i = 12.4 M_sun, M_2
sin^{3}i = 2.0 M_sun. We also estimate the orbital inclination angle to be
between 50 and 75 degrees. We suggest that the photometric, spectroscopic, and
polarimetric variations observed during the second half of the 20th century may
be due to variable mass transfer between the binary components.

true regardless of selection biases in the sample of detected DLA galaxies. We
test this prediction using several emission properties: half-light radius,

the conjecture that high-redshift DLA galaxies are Lyman-break galaxies. We

octupole interactions in the triple as well as general relativistic periastron
precession in the inner binary. The semimajor axes and the mutual inclination
of the inner and outer binaries are the most important factors affecting the

approximately equal mass black holes, it is possible to reduce the merger time
of a near circular inner binary by more than a factor of ten in over fifty
percent of all cases. We estimate that a typical exterior quadrupole moment
from surrounding matter in the galaxy may also be sufficient to excite

spherical blast wave. This shell cools radiatively down to approximately 10,000
K, providing after 6 Mio yrs a neutral column of 3.8 x 10^21 cm^-2 around the
whole system. The shell starts to fragment and forms condensations. This
absorbing screen will cover a smaller and smaller fraction of the radio source,
and therefore the emission line region, and eventually form stars in typically
10,000 globular clusters of one million solar masses. Approximately 10^9 solar
masses are entrained into the radio cocoon. This gas, cooling and illuminated
from the radio source, could be the emission line gas observed in high
redshifted radio galaxies and radio loud quasars. The neutral column behind the

diffraction profiles observed at high and intermediate temperatures in the
cubic and tetragonal phases, respectively, are in contrast to the broad

are associated with the monoclinic phase of MC-type previously reported by Kiat
et al and Singh et al., can only be interpreted as multiple coexisting
structures with MC as the major component. An analysis of the diffraction
profiles has allowed us to properly characterize the PMN-xPT phase diagram and
to determine the stability region of the monoclinic phase, which extends from
x= 31% to x= 37% at 20 K. The complex lansdcape of observed phases points to an
energy balance between the different PMN-xPT phases which is intrinsically much
more delicate than that of related systems such as PbZr(1-x)TixO3 or

g.g.Nc fixed, confirming the usual diagrammatic analysis. The lattice
calculations support the crucial assumption that the theory remains linearly
confining at large Nc. Moreover we see explicitly that Nc=3 is `close to'
Nc=infinity for many physical quantities. We comment on the fate of topology
and the deconfining transition at large Nc. We find that multiple confining
strings are strongly bound. The string tensions, K(k), of these k-strings are
close to the M(-theory)QCD-inspired conjecture as well as to `Casimir scaling'
with the most accurate recent calculations favouring the former. We point out
that closed k-strings provide a natural way for non-perturbative effects to
introduce O(1/Nc) corrections into the pure gauge theory, in contradiction to
the conventional diagrammatic expectation.

$SU(4)_C \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$. The models are non-supersymmetric,
even though SUSY is unbroken in the bulk. Baryon number is gauged and its
anomalies are cancelled through a generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism. We also
discuss models (PS-B class) which at low energy have the standard model
augmented by an anomaly free U(1) symmetry and show that multibrane wrappings
correspond to a trivial redefinition of the surviving global U(1) at low

proton is stable. The models are compatible with a low string scale of energy
less that 650 GeV and are directly testable at present or future accelerators
as they predict the existence of light left handed weak fermion doublets at
energies between 90 and 246 GeV. The neutrinos get a mass through an
unconventional see-saw mechanism. The mass relation $m_e = m_d$ at the GUT
scale is recovered. Imposing supersymmetry at particular intersections
generates non-zero Majorana masses for right handed neutrinos as well providing
the necessary singlets needed to break the surviving anomaly free U(1), thus
suggesting a gauge symmetry breaking method that can be applied in general

can change as a result of free motion, without the presence of forces. This
theory is conceptually and technically very different from Weyl's theory and
provides when extended to a curved conformal space a resolution of the long
standing problem of realistic masses in Kaluza-Klein theories.

The existence
of a local inverse of the field transformation (at least as a formal power
expansion) suggests a formulation of the ET, which allows a nilpotent BRST
symmetry. This strategy cannot be implemented at the quantum level if the
inverse is non-local. In this case we propose an alternative formulation of the
ET, where, by using Faddeev-Popov fields, this difficulty is circumvented. We
study the quantum deformation of the associated ST identity, which turns out to
be anomaly free, and show that a selected set of Green functions, which in some
cases can be identified with the physical observables of the model, does not
depend on the choice of the transformation of the fields. In general the
transformation of the fields yields a non-renormalizable theory. When the
equivalence is established between a renormalizable and a non-renormalizable
theory, the ET provides a way to give a meaning to the last one by using the
resulting ST identity. In this case the Quantum Action Principle cannot be of
any help in the discussion of the ET. We assume and discuss the validity of a
Quasi Classical Action Principle, which turns out to be sufficient for the
present work. As an example we study the renormalizability and unitarity of
massive QED in Proca's gauge by starting from a linear Lorentz-covariant gauge.

dimension, various self-repellent random walks converge to self-repellent
Brownian motion in the limit of weak interaction after appropriate space-time
scaling. Our method is based on cutting the path into pieces of an
appropriately scaled length, controlling the interaction between the different
pieces, and applying an invariance principle to the single pieces. In this way
we show that the self-repellent random walk large deviation rate function for
the empirical drift of the path converges to the self-repellent Brownian motion
large deviation rate function after appropriate scaling with the interaction
parameters. The method is considerably simpler than the approach followed in
our earlier work, which was based on functional analytic arguments applied to
variational representations and only worked in a very limited number of
situations.
  We consider two examples of a weak interaction limit: (1) vanishing
self-repellence, (2) diverging step variance. In example (1), we recover our
earlier scaling results for simple random walk with vanishing self-repellence
and show how these can be extended to random walk with steps that have zero
mean and a finite exponential moment. Moreover, we show that these scaling
results are stable against adding self-attraction, provided the self-repellence
dominates. In example (2), we prove a conjecture by Aldous for the scaling of
self-avoiding walk with diverging step variance. Moreover, we consider
self-avoiding walk on a two-dimensional horizontal strip such that the steps in
the vertical direction are uniform over the width of the strip and find the
scaling as the width tends to infinity.

a one-dimensional Brownian motion with self-repellence called the Edwards
model. Our results extend earlier work in which a law of large numbers,
respectively, a central limit theorem were derived. In the Edwards model a path
of length $T$ receives a penalty $e^{-\beta H_T}$, where $ H_T$ is the
self-intersection local time of the path and $\beta\in(0,\infty)$ is a
parameter called the strength of self-repellence. We identify the rate function
in the large deviation principle for the endpoint of the path as $\beta^{\frac
23} I(\beta^{-\frac 13}\cdot)$, with $I(\cdot)$ given in terms of the principal
eigenvalues of a one-parameter family of Sturm-Liouville operators. We show
that there exist numbers $0<b^{**}<b^*<\infty$ such that: (1) $I$ is linearly
decreasing on $[0,b^{**}]$; (2) $I$ is real-analytic and strictly convex on
$(b^{**},\infty)$; (3) $I$ is continuously differentiable at $b^{**}$; (4) $I$
has a unique zero at $b^*$. (The latter fact identifies $b^*$ as the asymptotic
drift of the endpoint.) The critical drift $b^{**}$ is associated with a
crossover in the optimal strategy of the path: for $b\geq b^{**}$ the path
assumes local drift $b$ during the full time $T$, while for $0\leq b<b^{**}$ it
assumes local drift $b^{**}$ during time $\frac{b^{**}+b}{2b^{**}}T$ and local
drift $-b^{**}$ during the remaining time $\frac{b^{**}-b}{2b^{**}}T$. Thus, in
the second regime the path makes an overshoot of size $\frac{b^{**}-b}{2}T$ in
order to reduce its intersection local time.

general understanding of the whispering gallery modes of such asymmetric
resonant cavities (ARCs). This theory combined with simulations of the
non-linear map describing the ray motion provides the basis for a ray-optics
model of the Q-spoiling of these whispering gallery modes for large
deformations (greater than 1% of the radius). The model predicts a sharp onset
as a function of deformation for significant Q-spoiling of these modes and
highly directional emission above this threshold. Solution of the wave equation
for typical whispering gallery modes confirms the qualitative behavior
predicted by the ray-optics model even when the cavity is only a few times the

digit with a quantum digit (qudit) assigned to each classical state. The shape
of the memory is the vector of sizes of these qudits, which may differ. We
determine when N copies of a quantum memory A embed in N(1+o(1)) copies of
another quantum memory B. This relationship captures the notion that B is as at
least as useful as A for all purposes in the bulk limit. We show that the
embeddings exist if and only if for all p >= 1, the p-norm of the shape of A
does not exceed the p-norm of the shape of B. The log of the p-norm of the
shape of A can be interpreted as the maximum of S(\rho) + H(\rho)/p (quantum
entropy plus discounted classical entropy) taken over all mixed states \rho on
A. We also establish a noiseless coding theorem that justifies these entropies.
The noiseless coding theorem and the bulk embedding theorem together say that
either A blindly bulk-encodes into B with perfect fidelity, or A admits a state
that does not visibly bulk-encode into B with high fidelity.
  In conclusion, the utility of a hybrid quantum memory is determined by its
simultaneous capacity for classical and quantum entropy, which is not a finite
list of numbers, but rather a convex region in the classical-quantum entropy
plane.

making full use of the locality and huge degrees of freedom, we show the
following: (i) If square fluctuation of every additive operator is O(V) or less
for a pure state, then it is not fragile in any WCNs or WPEs. (ii) If square
fluctuations of some additive operators are O(V^2) for a pure state, then it is
fragile in some WCNs or WPEs. (iii) If a state (pure or mixed) has the `cluster
property,' then it is stable against LMs, and vice versa. These results have
many applications, among which we discuss the mechanism of symmetry breaking in
