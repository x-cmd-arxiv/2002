and XMM-Newton surveys have significantly improved our knowledge of the objects
responsible of the hard X-ray background. A surprising finding is the discovery
of a population of optically dull, X-ray bright galaxies emerging at 2-10 keV
fluxes of the order of 10^{-14} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. We present preliminary
results of multiwavelength observations of a few objects serendipitously

galaxy NGC 4314. We have constructed the mass models based on the results of a
profile decomposition into disk, bulge, and bar components. Our models have
three different nuclear structures according to the assumption about the
nuclear bar: no nuclear bar, a synchronous nuclear bar and a fast nuclear bar.
Our SPH simulations show that the morphology of the nuclear region of NGC 4314
which is characterized by an elongated ring/spiral of newly formed stars and
HII regions, aligned nearly parallel to the primary bar can be understood in
terms of the secular evolution driven by the non-axisymmetric potential. The
slightly elongated and aligned nuclear ring of NGC 4314 can be formed by the
strong barred potential and the moderate central concentration of the bulge
mass with and without a nuclear bar. However, the nuclear spiral pattern can
not be developed without a nuclear bar. The nuclear bar of NGC 4314 seems to
rotate faster than the primary bar since the nuclear morphology induced by the
synchronous nuclear bar is much different from the observed one.

be emitted by young stellar populations are either absent or strongly
concentrated on the nuclei of early type galaxies (NGC 2950, NGC 3412, NGC
3945), while they are observed in the nuclei and circumnuclear regions of
intermediate type galaxies with strong bars (NGC 2523, NGC 5383). SPH
simulations of realistic mass models for these galaxies show that some disk
material can be driven into the nuclear regions by strong bar potentials. This
implies that the young stellar populations in the circumnuclear regions of
barred galaxies can be formed out of such gas. The existence of the nuclear
dust lanes is an indication of an on-going gas inflow and extremely young
stellar populations in these galaxies, because the nuclear dust lanes such as
those in NGC 5383 are not long-lasting features according to our simulations.
