a population of hot hydrogen gas surrounding these stars. Absorption from this
hot H I can be detected in high resolution Lyman-alpha spectra of these stars
from the Hubble Space Telescope. The amount of absorption can be used as a
diagnostic for the stellar mass loss rate. We present new mass loss rate
measurements derived in this fashion for four stars (Epsilon Eri, 61 Cyg A, 36
Oph AB, and 40 Eri A). Combining these measurements with others, we study how
mass loss varies with stellar activity. We find that for the solar-like GK
dwarfs, the mass loss per unit surface area is correlated with X-ray surface
flux. Fitting a power law to this relation yields Mdot ~ Fx^(1.15+/-0.20). The
active M dwarf Proxima Cen and the very active RS CVn system Lambda And appear
to be inconsistent with this relation. Since activity is known to decrease with
age, the above power law relation for solar-like stars suggests that mass loss
decreases with time. We infer a power law relation of Mdot ~ t^(-2.00+/-0.52).
This suggests that the solar wind may have been as much as 1000 times more
massive in the distant past, which may have had important ramifications for the
history of planetary atmospheres in our solar system, that of Mars in
particular.

studies (Kaspi et al. 2000), have shown that if the optical luminosity is
emitted by a steady accretion disc, about half of the objects are accreting
close to or higher than the Eddington rate. We conclude here that this result
is unavoidable, unless the masses are strongly underestimated by reverberation
studies, which does not seem to be the case. There are three issues to the
problem: 1. Accretion proceeds at Eddington or super-Eddington rates through
thick discs. Several consequences follow: an anti-correlation between the line
widths of the lines and the Eddington ratios, and a decrease of the Eddington
ratio with an increasing black hole mass. Extrapolated to all quasars, these
results imply that the amount of mass locked in massive black holes should be
larger than presently thought. 2. The optical luminosity is not produced
directly by the gravitational release of energy, and super-Eddington rates are
not required. The optical luminosity has to be emitted by a dense and thick
medium located at large distances from the center (10$^3$ to $10^4$
gravitational radii). It can be due to reprocessing of the X-ray photons from
the central source in a geometrically thin warped disc, or in dense ""blobs""
forming a geometrically thick system, which can be a part of the accretion flow
or the basis of an outflow. 3. Accretion discs are completely ""non standard"".
Presently neither the predictions of models nor the observed spectral

report the preliminary evidence of a probable association between galaxy
clusters and unidentified gamma-ray sources of high galactic latitude (|b|>20
deg) in the Third EGRET catalog. All of the clusters which are most probably
associated with EGRET sources show evidence of strong radio emission either
because they host radio galaxies/sources in their environments or because they
have a radio halo or relic inhabiting their intracluster medium. The cluster
radio emission suggests that the relativistic particles (electrons, protons),
which are diffusing in the intracluster medium, might be also responsible for
their gamma-ray emission. Beyond the spatial associations of clusters with
unidentified EGRET sources, we found a correlation between the radio flux at
1.4 GHz of the cluster's brightest source and the gamma-ray flux, F(>100 MeV),
of the associated EGRET source. For the most probable EGRET-cluster
associations we also found a further correlation between the X-ray luminosity
of galaxy clusters and the gamma-ray luminosity of the associated gamma-ray
source under the hypothesis that the EGRET sources have the same cluster
redshifts. Such correlations are consistent with the theoretical expectations
and strengthen the probability of a true, physical association between galaxy

identifications for 3C 356, which both seem to harbour AGN, and which have the
disturbed morphologies expected if they underwent an interpenetrating collision

temperature of the diffuse X-ray emission from this system as the result of
shock-heating of intracluster gas by the merger of two galaxy groups. Taken
together with the results on other well-studied powerful radio sources, we
suggest that the key ingredient for triggering a powerful radio source, at
least at epochs corresponding to z~1, is a galaxy--galaxy interaction which can
be orchestrated by the merger of their parent subclusters. This provides an
explanation for the rapid decline in the number density of powerful radio
sources since z~1. We argue that attempts to use distant radio-selected
clusters to trace the formation and evolution of the general cluster population
must address ways in which X-ray properties can be influenced by the radio
source, both directly, by mechanisms such as inverse-Compton scattering, and
indirectly, by the fact that the radio source may be preferentially triggered
at a specific time during the formation of the cluster.

This independent estimate of mass-loss rate is attained by fitting the observed
\HeI (5876) \AA and \HeII (5412) \AA line profiles, and the continuum light
curves of three Stokes parameters ((I, Q, U)) in the (V) band simultaneously.
The high accuracy of our determination arises from the use of many
observational constraints, and the sensitivity of the continuum polarization to
the mass-loss rate. Our best fit model suggests that the mass-loss rate of the
system is (\dot{M}_{\WR}=0.6(\pm 0.2) \times 10^{-5} M_{\sun} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}
), and is independent of the assumed distance to \object{V444 Cyg}. The fits

be in the range of 0.050 (for $R_{\WR}=5.0 R_{\sun}$) to 0.075 (for

emission from the wind-wind interaction zone and the absorption by the O-star

  Journal, May 2002","Astrophys.J.570:900-908,2002","10.1086/339625",,"astro-ph",,"  Several recent designs for planet-finding telescopes use coronagraphs
operating at visible wavelengths to suppress starlight along the telescope's
optical axis while transmitting any off-axis light from circumstellar material.
We describe a class of graded coronagraphic image masks that can, in principle,
provide perfect elimination of on-axis light, while simultaneously maximizing
the Lyot stop throughput and angular resolution. These ``band-limited'' masks
operate on the intensity of light in the image plane, not the phase. They can
work with almost any entrance pupil shape, provided that the entrance pupil
transmissivity is uniform, and can be combined with an apodized Lyot stop to
reduce the sensitivity of the coronagraph to imperfections in the image mask.
We discuss some practical limitations on the dynamic range of coronagraphs in
the context of a space-based terrestrial planet finder (TPF) telescope, and
emphasize that fundamentally, the optical problem of imaging planets around
nearby stars is a matter of precision fabrication and control, not Fraunhofer
diffraction theory.

Statistical analyses of the optical spectra show that the vast majority of

galaxies. Two of the infrared QSOs are also classified as low ionization BAL
QSOs. More than 70% of infrared QSOs are moderately or extremely strong Fe II
emitters. This is the highest percentage of strong Fe II emitters in all
subclasses of QSO/Seyfert 1 samples. We found that the Fe II to Hbeta, line
ratio is significantly correlated with the [OIII]5007 peak and Hbeta blueshift.
Soft X-ray weak infrared QSOs tend to have large blueshifts in permitted
emission lines and significant Fe II48,49 (5100--5400 A) residuals relative to
the Boroson & Green Fe II template. If the blueshifts in permitted lines are
caused by outflows, then they appear to be common in infrared QSOs. As the

investigate the evolutionary connection among these objects.

Two stars have inferred masses of about 10 Mo while the third is about 2 mag
brighter and at least twice as massive. All three variables are located in or
very close to the massive and young LMC associations (LH 41, 59 and 81). It is

metallicities in the discovered variables will provide a good test for the

Programme dedicated to very metal-poor stars. We find CS31082-001 to be
extremely rich in r-process elements, comparable in this respect only to the
similarly metal-poor, but carbon-enriched, giant CS22892-052. As a result of
the extreme overabundance of the heaviest r-process elements, and negligible
blending from CH and CN molecular lines, a reliable measurement is obtained of
the U II line at 386 nm, for the first time in a halo star, along with numerous
lines of Th II, as well as lines of 25 other r-process elements. Abundance
estimates for a total of 43 elements are reported in CS31082-001, almost half
of the entire periodic table. All elements with 56 \leq Z \leq 72 follow the
Solar r-element pattern, reduced by about 1.25 dex ([r/Fe]=+1.7 dex, a factor
50). Pb, in contrast, seems to be below the shifted Solar r-process
distribution, possibly indicating an error in the latter, while thorium is more
enhanced than the lighter nuclides. Thus, while a universal production ratio
for the r-process elements seems to hold in the interval 56 \leq Z \leq 72, it
breaks down in the actinide region. When available, the U/Th is thus preferable
to Th/Eu for radioactive dating: (i) because of its faster decay rate and
smaller sensitivity to observational errors, and (ii) because the inital
production ratio of the neighboring nuclides 238U and 232Th is more robustly
predicted than the 151Eu/232Th ratio. Our current best estimate for the age of

the electron dynamics in a double quantum well when intense AC electric fields
F, and tilted magnetic fields are applied simultaneously. The problem is
treated non-perturbatively by a time-dependent Hamiltonian in the effective
mass approximation, and using a Floquet-Fourier formalism. For B_par=0, the
quasi-energy spectra show two types of crossings: those related to different
Landau levels, and those associated to dynamic localization (DL), where the
electron is confined to one of the wells, despite the non-negligible tunneling
between wells. B_par couples parallel and in-plane motions producing
anti-crossings in the spectrum. However, since our approach is
non-perturbative, we are able to explore the entire frequency range. For high
frequencies, we reproduce the well known results of perfect DL given by zeroes
of a Bessel function. We find also that the system exhibits DL at the same
values of the field F, even as B_par non-zero, suggesting a hidden dynamical
symmetry in the system which we identify with different parity operations. The
return times for the electron at various values of field exhibit interesting
and complex behavior which is also studied in detail. We find that smaller
frequencies shifts the DL points to lower field F, and more importantly, yields
poorer localization by the field. We analyze the explicit time evolution of the
system, monitoring the elapsed time to return to a given well for each Landau
level, and find non-monotonic behavior for decreasing frequencies.

energy varying by as much as 5% of the total mass. We find that all
initial-data sets currently used for evolutions might contain unphysical
gravitational radiation of the order of several percent of the total mass. This
is comparable to the amount of gravitational-wave energy observed during the
evolved collision. More astrophysically realistic initial data will require
more careful choices of the freely specifiable data and boundary conditions for
both the metric and extrinsic curvature. However, we find that the choice of
extrinsic curvature affects the resulting data sets more strongly than the
choice of conformal metric.

under the influence of gravitational radiation reaction. We have adopted a well
established two-step approach: assuming that the particle is moving along a
geodesic (justifiable as long as the orbital evolution is adiabatic) we
calculate numerically the fluxes of energy and angular momentum radiated to
infinity and to the black hole horizon, via the Teukolsky-Sasaki-Nakamura
formalism. We can then infer the rate of change of orbital energy and angular
momentum and thus the evolution of the orbit. The orbits are fully described by
a semi-latus rectum $p$ and an eccentricity $e$. We find that while, during the
inspiral, $e$ decreases until shortly before the orbit reaches the separatrix
of stable bound orbits (which is defined by $p_{s}(e)$), in many
astrophysically relevant cases the eccentricity will still be significant in
the last stages of the inspiral. In addition, when a critical value
$p_{crit}(e)$ is reached, the eccentricity begins to increase as a result of
continued radiation induced inspiral. The two values $p_{s}$, $p_{crit}$ (for
given $e$) move closer to each other, in coordinate terms, as the black hole
spin is increased, as they do also for fixed spin and increasing eccentricity.
Of particular interest are moderate and high eccentricity orbits around rapidly
spinning black holes, with $p(e) \approx p_{s}(e)$. We call these
``zoom-whirl'' orbits, because of their characteristic behaviour involving
several revolutions around the central body near periastron. Gravitational
waveforms produced by such orbits are calculated and shown to have a very
particular signature. Such signals may well prove of considerable astrophysical
importance for the future LISA detector.

By comparing pressure as a function of baryon chemical potential we find that

phenomenon occurs for conformal symmetry in quantum Yang-Mills theories with

accelerating (de Sitter). This poses fundamental problems for string theory,
since a scattering matrix is not well defined in such Universes. In a previous

strings, which is characterized by eventual ``graceful'' exit from a de Sitter
phase. The model is based on a type-0 string theory, involving D3 brane worlds,
whose initial quantum fluctuations induce the non criticality. We argue in this
article that this model is compatible with the current observations. A crucial
r\^ole for the correct ``phenomenology'' of the model is played by the relative
magnitude of the flux of the five form of the type 0 string to the size of five
of the extra dimensions, transverse to the direction of the flux-field. We do
not claim, at this stage at least, that this model is a realistic physical
model for the Universe, but we find it interesting that the model cannot be

incompressible fluids involving interfaces is proposed. The present method is
based on the CIP-CUP (Cubic Interpolated Propagation / Combined, Unified
Procedure) method, which is a pressure-based semi-implicit solver for the Euler
equations of fluid flows. In Part I of this series of articles [M. Ida, Comput.
Phys. Commun. 132 (2000) 44], we proposed an improved scheme for the convection
terms in the equations, which allowed us discontinuous descriptions of the
density interface by replacing the cubic interpolation function used in the CIP
scheme with a quadratic extrapolation function only around the interface. In
this paper, as Part II of this series, the multi-time-step integration
technique is adapted to the CIP-CUP integration. Because the CIP-CUP treats
different-nature components in the fluid equations separately, the adaptation
of the technique is straightforward. This modification allows us flexible
determinations of the time interval, which results in an efficient and accurate
integration. Furthermore, some additional discussion on our methods is
presented. Finally, the application results to composite flow problems such as
compressible and incompressible Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and the dynamics
of two acoustically coupled deformable bubbles in a viscous liquid are
provided.

  methods","22 pages, 1 Table, 1 Figure",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.66.022104",,"quant-ph",,"  This work is an enquiry into the circumstances under which entropy methods
can give an answer to the questions of both quantum separability and classical
correlations of a composite state. Several entropy functionals are employed to
examine the entanglement and correlation properties guided by the corresponding
calculations of concurrence. It is shown that the entropy difference between
that of the composite and its marginal density matrices may be of arbitrary
sign except under special circumstances when conditional probability can be
defined appropriately. This ambiguity is a consequence of the fact that the
overlap matrix elements of the eigenstates of the composite density matrix with
those of its marginal density matrices also play important roles in the
definitions of probabilities and the associated entropies, along with their
respective eigenvalues. The general results are illustrated using pure and
mixed state density matrices of two-qubit systems. Two classes of density
matrices are found for which the conditional probability can defined: (1)
density matrices with commuting decompositions and (2) those which are
decohered in the representation where the density matrices of the marginals are
diagonal. The first class of states encompass those whose separability is
currently understood as due to particular symmetries of the states. The second
are a new class of states which are expected to be useful for understanding
separability. Examples of entropy functionals of these decohered states
including the crucial isospectral case are discussed.
