NGC 6951 are presented. A period of 220 days (416 days in the near-infrared) is
covered from the first observation obtained a few days before maximum light.
Spectroscopic observations are also discussed. Using as a distance calibrator
the Type Ia SN 2000E, which occurred some months later in the same galaxy, and
fitting a blackbody law to the photometric data we obtain a maximum bolometric
luminosity for SN 1999el of $\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. In general, the
photometric properties of SN 1999el are very similar to those of SN 1998S, a
bright and well studied Type IIn SN, showing a fast decline in all observed
bands similar to those of Type II-L SNe. The differences with SN 1998S are
analyzed and ascribed to the differences in a pre-existing circumstellar
envelope in which dust was already present at the moment of the SN outburst. We
infer that light echoes may play a possibly significant role in affecting the
observed properties of the light curves, although improved theoretical models
are needed to account for the data. We conclude that mass loss in the
progenitor RG stars is episodic and occurs in an asymmetric way. This implies
that collapsing massive stars appear as normal Type II SN if this occurs far
from major mass loss episodes, whereas they appear as Type IIn SNe if a large
mass loss episode is in progress.

This corresponds to a time ~3.5 Gyr in the past, which is only one quarter of
the present age of the Universe. Beyond z = 0.5 (a look-back time of 5 Gyr) the
effects of evolution on spiral structure are rather obvious: spiral arms are
less well-developed and more chaotic, and barred spiral galaxies seem rarer. By
z=1, around 30% of the galaxy population is sufficiently peculiar that
classification on Hubble's traditional tuning fork system is meaningless. On
the other hand, the co-moving space density and the sizes of luminous disks
have not changed significantly since z=1. Tully-Fisher measurements indicate
that the dynamical state and luminosities of large disk systems are also
consistent with passive evolution out to a redshift of unity. We conclude that
the general appearance of luminous disk galaxies has continuously changed with
cosmic epoch, but their overall numbers have been conserved since z=1, and the
bulk of the stars in these systems probably formed at z>1.

cause long-range order below T_N=217(5) mK with chains ordered
antiferromagnetically along their length and moments confined to the (b,c)
plane. Magnetic fields applied at an angle to the XY planes are found to
initially stabilize the order by promoting a spin-flop phase with an increased
perpendicular antiferromagnetic moment. In higher fields the antiferromagnetic
order becomes unstable and a transition occurs to a phase with no long-range
order in the (b,c) plane, proposed to be a spin liquid phase that arises when
the quantum fluctuations induced by the noncommuting field become strong enough
to overcome ordering tendencies. Magnetization measurements confirm that
saturation occurs at much higher fields and that the proposed spin-liquid state
exists in the region 2.10 < H_SL < 2.52 T || a. The observed phase diagram is
discussed in terms of known results on XY-like chains in coexisting
longitudinal and transverse fields.

magnitude of the most relevant finite g corrections, namely, the effect of
surface charge, the ``gate'' effect, and the fluctuation of the residual e-e

corrections of order Delta/sqrt(g). For typical values of the e-e interaction
(r_s ~ 1) and simple geometries, theory does indeed predict an asymmetric
distribution with a significant even/odd effect. The width of the distribution
is of order 0.3 Delta, and its dominant feature is a large peak for the odd
case, reminiscent of the delta-function in the g->oo limit. We consider finite
temperature effects next. Only after their inclusion is good agreement with the
experimental results obtained. Even relatively low temperature causes large
modifications in the peak spacing distribution: (a) its peak is dominated by
the even distribution at kT ~ 0.3 Delta (at lower T a double peak appears); (b)
it becomes more symmetric; (c) the even/odd effect is considerably weaker; (d)
the delta-function is completely washed-out; and (e) fluctuation of the

the d-density-wave phase is not present, at least for the superconductor with
the doping of 6.5 and the ordered ortho-II structure. We cannot exclude the
possibility that a broad peak may exist with extremely short-range DDW

Instead of a gap we find that the Q-correlated spin susceptibility persists to

Our theory concentrates on the universal aspects of reptational motion, and our

Evans-Edwards model, provided we allow for a phenomenological prefactor which
accounts for non-universal effects of the micro-structure of the Monte Carlo

function can be analyzed as special limits of our theory. First, the effects of
internal relaxation can be isolated by studying the limit $N \to \infty$, M
fixed. The results do not support the model of a `Rouse chain in a tube'. We
trace this back to the non-equilibrium initial conditions of the latter model.
Second, in the limit of long chains $(M = N \to \infty)$ and times large
compared to the internal relaxation time $(t/N^2 \to \infty)$, our theory
reproduces the results of the primitive chain model. This limiting form applies
only to extremely long chains, and for chain lengths accessible in practice,
effects of, e.g., tube length fluctuations are not negligible.

apparent indeterminateness of general relativity due to the general covariance
of the field equations) and its resolution in terms of Leibniz equivalence (the
statement that Riemannian geometries related by active diffeomorphisms
represent the same physical solution) have been the starting point for a lively
philosophical debate on the objectivity of the point-events of space-time. It
seems that Leibniz equivalence makes it impossible to consider the points of
the space-time manifold as physically individuated without recourse to
dynamical individuating fields. Various authors have posited that the metric
field itself can be used in this way, but nobody so far has considered the
problem of explicitly distilling the metrical fingerprint of point-events from
the gauge-dependent components of the metric field. Working in the Hamiltonian
formulation of general relativity, and building on the results of Lusanna and
Pauri (2002), we show how Bergmann and Komar's intrinsic pseudo-coordinates
(based on the value of curvature invariants) can be used to provide a physical
individuation of point-events in terms of the true degrees of freedom (the
Dirac observables) of the gravitational field, and we suggest how this
conceptual individuation could in principle be implemented with a well-defined
empirical procedure. We argue from these results that point-events retain a
significant kind of physical objectivity.

which the link to the phenomenology of general relativity is made. In process
physics the fundamental assumption is that reality is to be modelled as
self-organising semantic (or internal or relational) information using a
self-referentially limited neural network model. Previous progress in process
physics included the demonstration that space and quantum physics are emergent
and unified, with time a distinct non-geometric process, that quantum phenomena
are caused by fractal topological defects embedded in and forming a growing
three-dimensional fractal process-space, which is essentially a quantum foam.
Other features of the emergent physics were: quantum field theory with emergent
flavour and confined colour, limited causality and the Born quantum measurement
metarule, inertia, time-dilation effects, gravity and the equivalence
principle, a growing universe with a cosmological constant, black holes and
event horizons, and the emergence of classicality. Here general relativity and
the technical language of general covariance is seen not to be fundamental but
a phenomenological construct, arising as an amalgam of two distinct phenomena:
the `gravitational' characteristics of the emergent quantum foam for which
`matter' acts as a sink, and the classical `spacetime' measurement protocol,
but with the later violated by quantum measurement processes. Quantum gravity,
as manifested in the emergent Quantum Homotopic Field Theory of the
process-space or quantum foam, is logically prior to the emergence of the
general relativity phenomenology, and cannot be derived from it.

of a heavy charged Higgs boson (MH^+ >~ 200 GeV) is impossible for the

reinforce mutually, there are indeed regions of the MSSM parameter space which

discovery at the Tevatron for masses M_H^+<~ 300 GeV and M_H^+<~ 250 GeV,

critical point of a map from 4-space to the plane, the plane field is
essentially the field of kernels of the derivative of the map. Homotopically,
such a plane field determines two integers. I show that the sum of these
integers is the Milnor number of the fibered link. Taking the mirror image of a
link exchanges the integers. Various examples are computed. It is noted (proof
given elsewhere) that these integers are not determined by the algebraic

recursion relation for the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the anharmonic
oscillator. We extend this well known formalism to the time-dependent quantum
statistical Schroedinger equation, thus obtaining the imaginary-time evolution
amplitude by solving a recursive set of ordinary differential equations. This
approach enables us to evaluate global and local quantum statistical quantities
of the anharmonic oscillator to much higher orders than by evaluating Feynman
diagrams. We probe our perturbative results by deriving a perturbative
expression for the free energy which is then subject to variational
perturbation theory as developed by Kleinert, yielding convergent results for
the free energy for all values of the coupling strength.

condensate using the Gell-Mann realization of SU(3) symmetry. We show that
previously discussed phenomena of condensate fragmentation and spin-mixing can
be explained in terms of the hypercharge symmetry. The ground state of a
spinor-1 condensate is found to be fragmented for ferromagnetic interactions.
The notion of two bosonic mode squeezing is generalized to the two spin (U-V)
squeezing within the SU(3) formalism. Spin squeezing in the isospin subspace
(T) is found and numerically investigated. We also provide new results for the
stationary states of spinor-1 condensates.

The network has many potential applications ranging from purity tests and

reach of quantum technology that is currently being developed.

  (2001)",,,"quant-ph",,"  It is generally accepted, following Landauer and Bennett, that the process of
measurement involves no minimum entropy cost, but the erasure of information in
resetting the memory register of a computer to zero requires dissipating heat
into the environment. This thesis has been challenged recently in a two-part
article by Earman and Norton. I review some relevant observations in the
thermodynamics of computation and argue that Earman and Norton are mistaken:
there is in principle no entropy cost to the acquisition of information, but
the destruction of information does involve an irreducible entropy cost.

  systems","6 pages, 1 figure Submitted to Journal of Physics A",,,,"quant-ph cs.CC nlin.CD",,"  It is shown that evolution of wave functions in nonintegrable quantum systems
is unpredictable for a long time T because of rapid growth of number of
elementary computational operations $\mathcal O(T)\sim T^\alpha$. On the other
hand, the evolution of wave functions in integrable systems can be predicted by
the fast algorithms $\mathcal O(T)\sim (log_2 T)^\beta$ for logarithmically
short time and thus there is an algorithmic ""compressibility"" of their
dynamics. The difference between integrable and nonintegrable systems in our
approach looks identically for classical and quantum systems. Therefore the
minimal number of bit operations $\mathcal O(T)$ needed to predict a state of
system for time interval T can be used as universal sign of chaos.

(Faddeev-type) integral equation approach. As an application, we develop a
spinless, one-dimensional (1-D) model that mimics three-nucleon dynamics in one
dimension. Using simple two-body potentials that reproduce the deuteron
binding, we obtain that the three-body system binds at about 7.5 MeV. We then
consider two types of residual pionic corrections in the dynamical equation;
one related to the 2PI-exchange three-body diagram, the other to the
1PI-exchange three-body diagram. We find that the first contribution can
produce an additional binding effect of about 0.9 MeV. The second term produces
smaller binding effects, which are, however, dependent on the uncertainty in
the off-shell extrapolation of the two-body t-matrix. This presents interesting
analogies with what occurs in three dimensions. The paper also discusses the
general three-particle quantum scattering problem, for motion restricted to the
full line.
