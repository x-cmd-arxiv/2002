density inhomogeneities on scales much smaller than the disk scale height, due
to the nonlinear development of photon bubble instability. Radiation would
escape from such a ""leaky"" disk at a rate higher than that predicted by
standard accretion disk theory. The disk scale height is then smaller than that
of a similar disk without small-scale inhomogeneities, and the disk can remain
geometrically thin even as the flux approaches and exceeds the Eddington limit.
An idealized one-zone model for disks with radiation-driven inhomogeneities
suggests that the escaping flux could exceed L_E by a factor of up to ~10-100,
depending on the mass of the central object. Such luminous disks would develop
strong mass loss, but the resulting decrease in accretion rate would not
necessarily prevent the luminosity from exceeding L_E. We suggest that the
observed ""ultraluminous X-ray sources"" are actually thin, super-Eddington
accretion disks orbiting stellar-mass black holes, and need not indicate the
existence of a class of intermediate-mass black holes.

iron, while the other near the east has only weak lines. The other HII

derive the molecular concentrations through dissociation equilibrium
calculations, and estimate the opacities due to H2, H2O, OH, C2, CN, and CO for
any given density, temperature, and chemical composition of the gas. Then,
synthetic TP-AGB models with dredge-up are calculated by either 1) adopting the
newly developed routine, or 2) interpolating between fixed opacity tables for
solar chemical composition, which is the usual prescription in AGB evolution
calculations. The comparison between the two cases shows that the change in the
dominant opacity sources, as the C/O ratio grows from below to above unity,
crucially affects the evolution of the effective temperature, i.e. causing a
notable cooling of the carbon-rich models (with C/O>1). From the comparison
with observational data, it turns out that TP-AGB models with variable
molecular opacities are able to reproduce the observed range of effective
temperatures, mass-loss rates, and wind expansion velocities of C-type giants
in the solar neighbourhood, otherwise failed if assuming fixed molecular
opacities for solar-scaled mixtures. Finally, we mention other important
evolutionary and observational effects that result from the adoption of the
variable opacities, such as: i) significant shortening of the C-star phase due
to the earlier onset of the super-wind; ii) consequent reduction of the carbon
yields; iii) reproduction of the observed range of near-infrared colours of

two-component jet morphology, consisting of a fast central spine surrounded
with a boundary layer with a velocity shear. We study radiation of electrons
accelerated at such boundary layers as an option for standard approaches
involving internal shocks in jets. The acceleration process in the boundary
layer yields in a natural way a two component electron distribution: a
power-law continuum with a bump at the energy, where energy gains equal
radiation losses, followed by a cut-off. For such distributions we derive the
observed spectra of synchrotron and inverse-Compton radiation, including
comptonization of synchrotron and CMB photons. Under simple assumptions of
energy equipartition between the relativistic particles and the magnetic field,
the relativistic jet velocity at large scales and a turbulent character of the
shear layer, the considered radiation can substantially contribute to the jet
radiative output. In the considered conditions the synchrotron emission is
characterized by a spectral index of the radio-to-optical continuum being
approximately constant along the jet. A characteristic feature of the obtained
broad-band synchrotron spectrum is an excess at X-ray frequencies, similar to
the one observed in some objects by Chandra. As compared to the uniform jet
models, the velocity shear across the radiating boundary region leads to
decrease and frequency dependence of the observed jet-counterjet radio
brightness asymmetry. We conclude that a careful investigation of the
observational data looking for the derived effects can allow to evaluate the
role of the boundary layer acceleration processes and/or impose constraints for
the physical parameters of such layers in large scale jets.

separate these trial functions into a set representing integrable motions of
density waves, and a set containing all effects of non-integrability. It
transpires that the static structure factor is fixed by this minimum condition
to be the solution of the Yvon-Born-Green (YBG) equation. The residual
interactions between density waves are explicitly isolated in their Newtonian
representation and expanded by choosing the dominant objects in the phase space
of the system, that can be represented by a dissipative term with memory and a
random noise. This provides a mapping between deterministic and stochastic
dynamics. Imposing the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) allows us to
calculate the memory kernel. We write exactly the expression for it, following
two different routes, i.e. using explicitly Newtons equations, or instead,
their implicit form, that must be projected onto density pairs, as in the
development of the well-established Mode Coupling Theory (MCT). We compare
these two ways of proceeding, showing the necessity to enforce a new equation
of constraint for the two schemes to be consistent. Thus, while in the first
`Newtonian' representation a simple gaussian approximation for the random
process leads easily to the Mean Spherical Approximation (MSA) for the statics
and to MCT for the dynamics of the system, in the second case higher levels of

information in logic programming under the answer set semantics. An ordered
logic program is an extended logic program in which rules are named by unique
terms, and in which preferences among rules are given by a set of atoms of form
s < t where s and t are names. An ordered logic program is transformed into a
second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected,
in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed program correspond with the
preferred answer sets of the original program. Our approach allows the
specification of dynamic orderings, in which preferences can appear arbitrarily
within a program. Static orderings (in which preferences are external to a
logic program) are a trivial restriction of the general dynamic case. First, we
develop a specific approach to reasoning with preferences, wherein the
preference ordering specifies the order in which rules are to be applied. We
then demonstrate the wide range of applicability of our framework by showing
how other approaches, among them that of Brewka and Eiter, can be captured
within our framework. Since the result of each of these transformations is an
extended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as
dlv and smodels. To this end, we have developed a publicly available compiler

effect amplifies the signal, and the cut-off suppresses backgrounds which

successful in the prediction and description of main features of multiparticle

problems are discussed. It is shown that the analytical calculations at the
parton level with the low-momentum cut-off reproduce experimental data on the
hadronic final state in multiparticle production processes at high energies
surprisingly accurately even though the perturbative expansion parameter is not
very small. Moreover, it is important that the perturbative QCD has been able
not only to describe the existing data but also to predict many bright
qualitatively new phenomena.

of order one TeV. In an earlier work, a successful pattern for fermion masses
and mixings (to be called pattern I) has been proposed within a unified
SO(10)-framework, based on MSSM, which makes seven predictions, in good accord
with observations, including V_{cb} ~ 0.04, and \sin^22\theta_{\nu_\mu\nu_\tau}
\~ 1. To exibit new phenomenological possibilities which may arise within ESSM,
we present here a variant pattern (to be called pattern II) for fermion masses

of success as pattern I as regards the masses and mixings of all fermions
including neutrinos. The main point of this paper is to first note that either
one of these two patterns, embedded in ESSM, would lead to a reduction in the
LEP neutrino-counting from N_\nu = 3 (in good agreement with the data) and also
provide a simple explanation of the (g-2)_\mu-anomaly, as pointed out in the
accompanying paper. They can, however, be distinguished from each other by (a)
a sharpening of our understanding of the true magnitude of the anomaly in
\nu_\mu-nucleon scattering, recently reported by the NuTeV group, (b) improved
measurements of m_t, m_H and m_W, (c) improved tests of e-\mu
lepton-universality in charged current processes, and (d) improvements in the
measurements of V_{ud} and V_{us}. Pattern II (extended to ESSM) would predict
departures from the standard model in the right direction with regard to (a)
and (b), though not as regards (c) and (d) while Pattern I practically would
coincide with the standard model as regards its predictions for all four

three classes of polynomials in infinite dimensions. We fix as an underlying
space a (non-compact) Riemannian manifold $X$ and an intensity measure $\sigma$
on it. We consider a Jacobi field in the extended Fock space over
$L^2(X;\sigma)$, whose field operator at a point $x\in X$ is of the form
$\di_x^\dag+\lambda\di_x^\dag \di_x+\di_x+\di^\dag_x\di_x\di_x$, where
$\lambda$ is a real parameter. Here, $\di_x$ and $\di_x^\dag$ are,

realize the field operators as multiplication operators in $L^2({\cal

measure the strength of the nonlocality of an equal mixture of two bipartite,
orthogonal, but locally indistinguishable separable states. This gives
supporting evidence of nonzero value for a separable state, for this measure of
nonlocality. We also show that this measure of quantum correlations places a
different order on the set of states, than the good asymptotic measures of
entanglement. And that such a different order imposed on two states by the work
deficit and any entanglement measure, cannot be explained by mixedness alone.

correction/avoidance strategies for preserving quantum coherence of an open
quantum system S e.g., a quantum computer. The existence of a non-trivial group
of symmetries of the dynamical algebra of S provides state-space sectors immune
to decoherence. Such noiseless sectors, that can be viewed as a noncommutative
version of the pointer basis, are shown to support universal quantum
computation and to be robust against perturbations. When the required symmetry
is not present one can generate it artificially resorting to active
symmetrization procedures.

  Particles",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  In this note we demonstrate that a quantum-like interference picture could
appear as a statistical effect of interference of deterministic particles, i.e.
particles that have trajectories and obey deterministic equations, if one
introduces a discrete time. The nature of the resulting interference picture
does not follow from the geometry of force field, but is strongly attached to
the time discreetness parameter. As a demonstration of this concept we consider
a scattering of charged particles on the charged screen with a single slit. The
resulting interference picture has a nontrivial minimum-maximum distribution
which vanishes as the time discreetness parameter goes to zero that could be
interpreted as an analog of quantum decoherence.
