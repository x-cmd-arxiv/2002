through the resonant density and find that the adibaticity condition is
satisfied for most photon energies of interest, allowing for a normal-mode
treatment of the photon propagation. We then construct radiative equilibrium
atmosphere models of strongly magnetized neutron stars that includes these
effects, employing a new numerical method that resolves accurately the sharp
changes of the absorption and mode-coupling cross sections at the resonant
densities. We show that the resulting spectra are modified by both resonances
and are harder at all field strengths than a blackbody at the effective
temperature. We also show that the narrow absorption features introduced by the
proton cyclotron resonance have small equivalent widths. We discuss the
implications of our results for properties of thermal emission from the
surfaces of young neutron stars.

a stellar population synthesis model, we estimate the stellar mass functions of
each of these components. The disk and spheroid luminosity functions are
remarkably similar. We do, however, find evidence in the bi-variate luminosity
function that spheroid-dominated galaxies occur only among the brightest
spheroids, while disk-dominated galaxies span a much wider range of disk
luminosities. Remarkably, the total stellar mass residing in disks and
spheroids is approximately the same. For our sample, we find the ratio of
stellar masses in disks and spheroids to be 1.3+/-0.2. Ongoing large
photometric and redshift surveys will lead to a large increase in the number of

of the central dark object M and the velocity dispersion sigma of the host
galaxy, of the form log(M/M_sun) = a + b*log(sigma/sigma_0); however, published
estimates of the slope b span a wide range (3.75 to 5.3). Merritt & Ferrarese
have argued that low slopes (<4) arise because of neglect of random measurement
errors in the dispersions and an incorrect choice for the dispersion of the
Milky Way Galaxy. We show that these explanations account for at most a small
part of the slope range. Instead, the range of slopes arises mostly because of
systematic differences in the velocity dispersions used by different groups for
the same galaxies. The origin of these differences remains unclear, but we
suggest that one significant component of the difference results from Ferrarese
& Merritt's extrapolation of central velocity dispersions to r_e/8 (r_e is the
effective radius) using an empirical formula. Another component may arise from
dispersion-dependent systematic errors in the measurements. A new determination
of the slope using 31 galaxies yields b=4.02 +/- 0.32, a=8.13 +/- 0.06, for

defined within an aperture of size less than 0.5 kpc, is found to correlate
tightly with the galaxy's circular velocity, the latter measured at distances
from the galactic center at which the rotation curve is flat, 20 to 80kpc. By
using the well known M-sigma relation for SBHs, and a prescription to relate
the circular velocity to the mass of the dark matter halo in a standard CDM
cosmology, the correlation between velocity dispersion and circular velocity is
equivalent to one between SBH and halo masses. Such a correlation is found to
be nonlinear, with the ratio between the two masses decreasing from 2X10^-4 for
halos of 10^14 solar masses, to 10^-5 for halos of 10^12 solar masses.

the power spectra with frequency separations less than 0.06 c/d(0.7 microHz) as
well as amplitude variability. We examine the interpretation in terms of
separate excited stellar pulsation modes,single modes with variable amplitudes,
and observational problems. The variable-phase technique, which examines the
phase jumps near the times of minimum amplitude of an assumed single frequency,
is applied to the extensive data of the star BI CMi, which shows some of the
most extreme behavior. The following results are found for the 5 features in
the power spectrum which could be explained as single modes with variable
amplitudes or as double modes: for three features it can be shown that these
are indeed pairs of separate pulsation modes beating with each other: at times
of minimum amplitude the phase jumps are observed and both the observed
amplitude and phase variations can be predicted correctly by assuming two
separate modes of nearly equal frequencies. Artifacts caused by observational
error,insufficient frequency resolution or variable amplitudes can be ruled
out. A fourth pair has a probable origin in two excited modes, while a 5th case
is inconclusive due to long time scales of variability and small amplitudes.The
existence of close frequencies need to be taken into account in planning the
lengths of earth-based as well as space campaigns so that sufficient frequency
resolution is obtained. Possible reasons for the existence of close frequencies
in Delta Scuti stars are considered.They include the dense frequency spacing
caused by the presence of mixed modes, rotational splitting as well as
near-coincidence of the frequencies of modes with different l values (the
so-called Small Spacing).

sums or differences of the real modes) enabled us not only to test theoretical
predictions but also to indirectly infer spherical and azimuthal degrees of
real modes that had no observed splittings. In addition to the above, we
measure line-of-sight velocities from our spectra. We find only marginal
evidence for periodic modulation associated with the pulsation modes: at the
frequency of the strongest mode in the lightcurve, we measure an amplitude of
2.6+/-1.0 km/s, which has a probability of 2% of being due to chance; for the
other modes, we find lower values. Our velocity amplitudes and upper limits are
smaller by a factor of two compared to the amplitudes found in ZZ Psc. We find
that this is consistent with expectations based on the position of HS
0507+0434B in the instability strip. Combining all the available information
from data such as ours is a first step towards constraining atmospheric
properties in a convectionally unstable environment from an observational
perspective.

growth on GaAs(001), focusing on the interplay between chemistry and magnetism
at the interface. Four features appear to be generic: (1) At submonolayer
coverages, a strong chemical interaction between Fe and substrate atoms leads
to substitutional adsorption and intermixing. (2) For films of several
monolayers and more, atomically abrupt interfaces are energetically favored.
(3) For Fe films over a range of thicknesses, both Ga- and As-adlayers
dramatically reduce the formation energies of the films, suggesting a
surfactant-like action. (4) During the first few monolayers of growth, Ga or As
atoms are likely to be liberated from the interface and diffuse to the Fe film
surface. Magnetism plays an important auxiliary role for these processes, even

of the presented machinery, a proof of the almost-everywhere smoothness of the
Lorentzian distance considered as a function of one of the two arguments is
given. Afterwards, using a $C^*$-algebra approach, the spacetime causal
structure and the Lorentzian distance are generalized into noncommutative
structures giving rise to a Lorentzian version of part of Connes'
noncommutative geometry. The generalized noncommutative spacetime consists of a
direct set of Hilbert spaces and a related class of $C^*$-algebras of
operators. In each algebra a convex cone made of self-adjoint elements is
selected which generalizes the class of causal functions. The generalized
events, called {\em loci}, are realized as the elements of the inductive limit
of the spaces of the algebraic states on the $C^*$-algebras. A partial-ordering
relation between pairs of loci generalizes the causal order relation in
spacetime. A generalized Lorentz distance of loci is defined by means of a
class of densely-defined operators which play the r\^ole of a Lorentzian
metric. Specializing back the formalism to the usual globally hyperbolic
spacetime, it is found that compactly-supported probability measures give rise
to a non-pointwise extension of the concept of events.

skewon part $^{(2)}\chi$ (15 components) and the axion part $^{(3)}\chi$ (1

represented by a 2nd rank traceless tensor $\not S_i{}^j$. By means of the
Fresnel equation, we discuss how this tensor disturbs the light cones.
Accordingly, this is a mechanism for violating Lorentz invariance and time
symmetry. In contrast, the (abelian) axion part $^{(3)}\chi$ does {\em not}

link of a given direction and parity of a 10fm^4 configuration is updated, the

simultaneously. One finds that the a_mu(SUSY) can be as large as (10-20)*10^-10
for any tan beta, imposing the upper limit on the tau -> mu gamma branching
ratio. Furthermore, the two-loop Barr-Zee type contributions to a_mu(SUSY) can
be significant for large tan beta, if a stop is light and mu and A_t are large
enough (O(1) TeV). In this case, it is possible to have a_mu(SUSY) upto
O(10)*10^-10 without conflicting with tau -> l gamma. We conclude that the
possible maximal value for a_mu(SUSY) is about 20*10^-10 for any tan beta.
Therefore the BNL experiment on the muon a_mu can exclude the effective SUSY

dimensional regularization with great care concerning the conformal-mode
dependence. In this regularization, resummation can be automatically carried
out without making an assumption like that of David, Distler and Kawai. In this
paper we consider a model of 4D quantum gravity coupled to QED. Resummation
inevitably implies a four-derivative quantum gravity. The renormalizability is
directly checked up to $O(e_r^6)$ and $O(t_r^2)$, where $e_r$ and $t_r$ are the
running coupling constants of QED and the traceless gravitational mode. There
is no other running coupling constant in our model. The conformal mode is
treated exactly, which means it is unrenormalized. It is found that Hathrell's
results are included in our results. As a by-product, it is found that a
higher-order gravitational correction to the beta function of QED is negative.
An advantage of our model is that in the very high-energy regime, it closely
resembles exactly solvable 2D quantum gravity. Thus, we can study physical
states of 4D quantum gravity in this regime in parallel to those of 2D quantum
gravity, which can be described with diffeomorphism invariant composite fields.

  Review E, in press",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.65.066606",,"nlin.PS astro-ph physics.ao-ph",,"  A general wave model with the cubic nonlinearity is introduced to describe a
situation when the linear dispersion relation has three branches, which would
intersect in the absence of linear couplings between the three waves. Actually,
the system contains two waves with a strong linear coupling between them, to
which a third wave is then coupled. This model has two gaps in its linear
spectrum. Realizations of this model can be made in terms of temporal or
spatial evolution of optical fields in, respectively, a planar waveguide or a
bulk-layered medium resembling a photonic-crystal fiber. Another physical
system described by the same model is a set of three internal wave modes in a
density-stratified fluid. A nonlinear analysis is performed for solitons which
have zero velocity in the reference frame in which the group velocity of the
third wave vanishes. Disregarding the self-phase modulation (SPM) term in the
equation for the third wave, we find two coexisting families of solitons:
regular ones, which may be regarded as a smooth deformation of the usual gap
solitons in a two-wave system, and cuspons with a singularity in the first
derivative at their center. Even in the limit when the linear coupling of the
third wave to the first two vanishes, the soliton family remains drastically
different from that in the linearly uncoupled system; in this limit, regular
solitons whose amplitude exceeds a certain critical value are replaced by
peakons. While the regular solitons, cuspons, and peakons are found in an exact
analytical form, their stability is tested numerically, which shows that they
all may be stable. If the SPM terms are retained, we find that there again
coexist two different families of generic stable soliton solutions, namely,
regular ones and peakons.

for the stationary pulselike solutions in birefringent fibers when differences
in both phase velocities and group velocities between the two components and
rapidly oscillating terms are taken into account. After checking the validity
of the approximation we study how the soliton pulse shape depends on its
velocity and nonlinear propagation constant. By numerically solving the
propagation equation we have found that most of these stationary solutions are
stable.

will enable a fast and intrinsically two-photon detector, which would be of
interest for quantum information and metrology applications. We consider two
types of two-photon processes that can be observed using a very faint, but
quantum-correlated biphoton field. These are optical up-conversion and an
external photoelectric effect. We estimate the correlation enhancement factor
for the biphoton light compared to coherent light, report and discuss the
preliminary experimental results.

algorithms, including Shor's factoring algorithm, allows a quantum computer to
accurately determine an eigenvalue of an unitary operator. Quantum
nondemolition measurements are a quantum mechanical procedure, used to overcome
the standard quantum limit when measuring an observable. We show that the phase
estimation algorithm, in both the discrete and continuous variable setting, can
be viewed as a quantum nondemolition measurement.
