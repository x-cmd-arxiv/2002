GRBs is much larger than the observed one. There are 500 unobserved GRBs for
each observed one. The lack of a clear trigger makes it hard to detect these
unobserved GRBs as orphan afterglows. At late time, hundreds or thousands of
years after a GRB, we expect to observe a GRB remnant (GRBR). These remnants
could be distinguished from the more frequent SNRs using their different
morphology. While SNRs are spherical, GRBRs that arise from a highly collimated
flow, are expected to be initially nonspehrical. Using SPH simulations we
follow the evolution of a GRBR and calculate the image of the remnant produced
by bremsstrahlung and by synchrotron emission. We find that the GRBR becomes
spherical after $ \sim 3000 {\rm yr}(E_{51}/n)^{1/3}$ at $R\sim 12{\rm pc}
(E_{51}/n)^{1/3}$, where $E_{51}$ is the initial energy in units of
$10^{51}{\rm erg}$ and $n$ is the surrounding ISM number density in ${\rm

Namely, we expect $\sim ~ 20$ non spherical GRBRs with angular sizes $\sim 1
\mu$arcsec within a distance of 10Mpc. These results are modified if there is
an underlying spherical supernova. In this case the GRBR will remain spherical
only for $\sim150 {\rm yr} (E_{51}/n)^{1/3}$ and the number of non-spherical
GRBRs is smaller by a factor of 10 and their size is smaller by a factor of 3.

wavelengths. The most recent data include a complete ISO (SWS and LWS)
spectrum, which displays a remarkable richness in atomic fine-structure lines.
The number of observables is twice as much as the number available in previous
studies. In addition, most atomic species are now observed in two ionization
stages. The radio and infrared data on G29.96 are best reproduced using a
nebular model with two density components: a diffuse (n_e~680cm-3) extended (~1
pc) component surrounding a compact (~0.1 pc) dense (n_e~57000cm-3) core. The
properties of the ionizing star were derived using state-of-the-art stellar
atmosphere models. CoStar models yield an effective temperature of
\~30^{+2}_{-1} kK whereas more recent non-LTE line blanketed atmospheres with
stellar winds indicate somewhat higher values, Teff~32--38 kK. This range in
Teff is compatible with all observational constraints, including near-infrared
photometry and bolometric luminosity. The range 33-36 kK is also compatible
with the spectral type O5-O8 determined by Watson and Hanson (97) when recent
downward revisions of the effective temperature scale of O stars are taken into
account. The age of the ionizing star of G29.96 is found to be a few 10^6 yr,
much older than the expected lifetime of UCHII regions. Accurate gas phase
abundances are derived with the most robust results being Ne/S=7.5 and N/O=0.43
(1.3 and 3.5 times the solar values, respectively).

galaxy, NGC 1068, taken with XMM-Newton RGS and Chandra LETGS. Its rich
emission-line spectrum is dominated by recombination in a warm plasma (bright,
narrow radiative recombination continua provide the ``smoking gun''), which is
photoionized by the inferred nuclear power-law continuum. Radiative decay
following photoexcitation of resonant transitions is also significant. A
self-consistent model of an irradiated cone of gas is capable of reproducing
the hydrogenic/heliumlike ionic line series in detail. The radial ionic column
densities we infer are consistent with absorption measurements (the warm
absorber) in Seyfert 1 galaxies. This strongly suggests that the emission
spectrum we observe from NGC 1068 emanates from its warm absorber. The observed
extent of the ionization-cone/warm absorber in NGC 1068 of about 300 pc implies
that a large fraction of the gas associated with generic warm absorbers may
typically exist on the hundreds-of-parsec scale rather than much closer to the
nucleus (e.g., less than a parsec). Spatially-resolved spectroscopy using the
LETGS of two distinct emission regions yields two noticeably different spectra.
We show that these differences are solely due to differing radial column
densities. A fairly flat distribution in ionization parameter is necessary to
explain the inferred radial ionic column densities of all spectra. This must
primarily be due to a broad density distribution at each radius, spanning
roughly 0.1-100 cm$^{-3}$. (Abridged)

magnetohydrodynamic stability analysis, we show that long-wavelength modes are
primarily destabilized by the entropy gradient and that such `convective' modes
transport angular momentum inwards. Moreover, the stability criteria for the
convective modes are the standard Hoiland criteria of hydrodynamics. By
contrast, shorter wavelength modes are primarily destabilized by magnetic
tension and differential rotation. These `MRI' modes transport angular momentum
outwards. The convection-dominated accretion flow (CDAF) model, which has been
proposed for radiatively inefficient accretion onto a black hole, posits that
inward angular momentum transport and outward energy transport by
long-wavelength convective fluctuations are crucial for determining the
structure of the accretion flow. Our analysis suggests that the CDAF model is
applicable to a magnetohydrodynamic accretion flow provided the magnetic field
saturates at a sufficiently sub-equipartition value (plasma beta >> 1), so that
long-wavelength convective fluctuations can fit inside the accretion disk.
Numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations are required to determine whether
such a sub-equipartition field is in fact obtained.

waves with wavevectors of different orientations but same modulus. We show that

that it is favorable to have a real order parameter and that, among these

to an order parameter with a $\cos({\bf q}_{0}. {\bf r})$ dependence, in
agreement with preceding work. Finally we show that the order parameter at the

conductance obeys a power-law scaling form, similar to that of a 1D Luttinger
liquid. The exponent is magnetic-field dependent, and more surprisingly, may be
positive or negative, i. e., interactions may either suppress or enhance the

action of the cyclic group of order p yielding the lens space L(p,q).
Therefore, every lens space carries a natural quotient contact structure Q. A
theorem of Eliashberg and McDuff classifies the symplectic fillings of (L(p,1),
Q) up to diffeomorphism. We announce a generalization of that result to every
lens space. In particular, we give an explicit handlebody decomposition of
every symplectic filling of (L(p,q), Q) for every p and q. Our results imply
that: (a) there exist infinitely many lens spaces L(p,q) with q>1 such that
(L(p,q), Q) admits only one symplectic filling up to blowup and diffeomorphism;
(b) for any natural number N, there exist infinitely many lens spaces L(p,q)
such that (L(p,q), Q) admits more than N symplectic fillings up to blowup and
diffeomorphism.

omega is in the phonon band, the p-mode becomes modulationally unstable above a
critical forcing, which we determine analytically in terms of the parameters of

leads to the formation of a travelling multibreather, that, in the
low-amplitude limit could be described in terms of soliton solutions of a
suitable driven-damped nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) equation. Similar

fall on Regge trajectories. When their squared masses are plotted against the
intrinsic orbital angular momenta {\rm L}, $\Delta^*$'s with even and odd
parity can be described by the same Regge trajectory. For a given {\rm L},
nucleon resonances with spin {\rm S}=3/2 are approximately degenerate in mass
with $\Delta$ resonances. To which total angular momentum {\rm L} and {\rm S}
couple has no significant impact on the baryon mass. Nucleons with spin 1/2 are
shifted in mass; the shift is - in units of squared masses - proportional to
the component in the wave function which is antisymmetric in spin and flavor.
Based on these observations, a new baryon mass formula is proposed which
reproduces nearly all known baryon masses. It is shown that the masses are
compatible with a quark-diquark picture while the richness of the
experimentally known states require three particles to participate in the
dynamics. This conflict is resolved by proposing that quarks polarize the QCD
condensates and are surrounded by a polarization cloud shielding the color. A
new interpretation of constituent quarks as colored quark clusters emerges;
their interaction is responsible for the mass spectrum. Fast flavor exchange
between the colored quark clusters exhausts the dynamical richness of the
three-particle dynamics. The colored-quark-cluster model provides a mechanism
in which the linear confinement potential can be traced to the increase of the
volume in which the condensates are polarized. The quark-spin magnetic moment
induces currents in the polarized condensates which absorb the quark-spin
angular momentum: the proton spin is not carried by quark spins. The model
provides a new picture of hybrids and glueballs.

can be well understood in terms of the dominant isovector $\pi N$-double
scattering contribution. We calculate in chiral perturbation theory all
one-pion loop corrections to this double scattering term which in the case of
$\pi N$-scattering close the gap between the current-algebra prediction and the
empirical value of the isovector threshold T-matrix $T_{\pi N}^-$. In addition
to closing this gap there is in the $\pi d$-system a loop-induced off-shell
correction for the exchanged virtual pion. Its coordinate space representation
reveals that it is equivalent to $2\pi$-exchange in the deuteron. We evaluate
the chirally corrected double scattering term and the off-shell contribution
with various realistic deuteron wave functions. We find that the off-shell
correction contributes at most -8% and that the isovector double scattering
term explains at least 90% of the empirical value of the real part of the $\pi
d$-scattering length.

setting an upper limit, and generalize to ``Optimum Interval'' methods, which
use intervals with especially few events. These methods, which apply to the
case of relatively small backgrounds, do not use binning, are relatively
insensitive to cuts on the range of the parameter, are parameter independent

true, though possibly conservative, classical one-sided confidence intervals.
