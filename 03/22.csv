paper to result as a product of two merging black holes. If the surrounding
stellar cluster is as massive as the binary black hole, the torque acting on
the stars ejects a fraction which extracts all the binary's angular momentum on
scales of ~10^7 yr, and a geometrically thick torus remains. In the present
article we show that a certain fraction of the stars has winds, shaped into
elongated tails by the central radiation pressure, which are optically thick
for line of sights aligned with them. These stars are sufficiently numerous to
achieve a covering factor of 1, so that the complete torus is optically thick.
We find the parameters of such a patchy torus to be in the right range to
explain the observed large column densities in AGN and their temporal
variations on time scales of about a decade. Within this model the BAL quasars
can be interpreted as quasars seen at intermediate inclination angles, with the
line of sight grazing the edge of the torus. The opening angle of the torus is
wider for major mergers and thus correlates with the central luminosity. In
this picture the spin of the merged black hole is possibly dominated by the
orbital angular momentum of the binary. Thus the spin of the merged black hole
points into a new direction, and consequently the jet experiences a spin-flip
according to the spin-paradigm. This re-orientation could be an explanation for
the X-shaped radio galaxies, and the advancing of a new jet through the ambient
medium for Compact Symmetric Objects.

place constraints on models of the jet dynamics.
  A previously unknown one-sided X-ray jet in 3C31, extending up to 8 arcsec

attribute the radiation to synchrotron emission from a high-energy population
of electrons. In situ particle acceleration is required in the region of the
jet where bulk deceleration is taking place.
  We also present X-ray spectra and luminosities of the galaxies in the Arp 331

Weinberg in the context of external galaxies, requires projected positions,
$(l,b)$, and line-of-sight velocities for a spatially complete sample of
relaxed tracers. If the local standard of rest (LSR) has a zero velocity in the
radial direction ($u_{\rm LSR}$), then the quantity that is measured is $\Delta
V \equiv \Omega_p R_0 - V_{\rm LSR}$, where $\Omega_p$ is the pattern speed of
the non-axisymmetric feature, $R_0$ is the distance of the Sun from the
Galactic centre and $V_{\rm LSR}$ is the tangential motion of the LSR,
including the circular velocity. We use simple models to assess the reliability
of the method for measuring a single, constant pattern speed of either a bar or
spiral in the inner MWG. We then apply the method to the OH/IR stars in the
ATCA/VLA OH 1612 MHz survey of Sevenster et al, finding $\Delta V = 252 \pm 41$
km/s, if $u_{\rm LSR} = 0$. Assuming further that $R_0 = 8$ kpc and $V_{\rm
LSR} = 220$ \kms, this gives $\Omega_p = 59\pm 5$ km/s/kpc with a possible
systematic error of perhaps 10 km/s/kpc. The non-axisymmetric feature for which
we measure this pattern speed must be in the disc of the MWG.

follows: 1) All AGNs show significant structure in their inner 100 pc and 1 kpc
regions whose amplitude is similar in all of them, independent of the Hubble
type of the host galaxy. 2) When considering early-type galaxies, non-AGN
galaxies show no structure at all, contrary to what we find for AGN. 3) When
considering late-type galaxies, both AGN and non-AGN galaxies show significant
structure in their central region. Our results are consistent with the
hypothesis that all early-type galaxies host a supermassive black hole, but
only those that have enough material in the central regions to fuel it show an
active nucleus. The situation is more complicated in late-type galaxies. Either
not all of them host a central black hole, or, in some of them, the material
inside the innermost 100 pc region is not transported to the scales of the
central engine for some reason, or the large amount of gas and dust hides the
active nucleus from our sight.

are significant. The spiral arms are clearly seen in the HeI maps, with the
receding arm being stronger in the red side while the approaching arm is
stronger in the blue side of the line. The analysis of the Halpha maps suggests
that this emission arises mainly from a large and vertically-extended region

the uneclipsed light is dominated by a strong, blueshifted and narrow Halpha
emission line superimposed on a red continuum and can be understood as a
combination of emission from an M5V secondary star plus optically thin emission
from the outer parts of the vertically-extended disc wind. The inner disc
regions show an emission line spectrum with a strong and broad Halpha component

unusually strong Ca lines (>~solar [Fe/H]) at a common velocity of -340km/s
close to M31's systemic velocity, similar to what might be expected for M31

warped to account for these stars. More likely, these stars are metal-rich

triaxial halos by means of Liapunov exponents. This method is perfectly
suitable for time-dependent 3D potentials where surfaces of sections and other
simple diagnostics are not applicable. We find that when halos are
centrally-concentrated most trajectories starting near the plane containing the
bar become chaotic. Moreover, the shape of many of the remaining regular
trajectories do not match the bar density distribution, being too round.
Therefore, time-independent self-consistent solutions are highly unlikely to be
found. When the non-rotating non-axisymmetric perturbation in the potential
reaches 10%, almost all trajectories integrated are chaotic and have large
Liapunov exponents. No regular trajectories aligned with the bar have been
found. Hence, if the evolution of the density figure is directly related to the
characteristic timescale of orbital instability, bar dissolution would take
place on a timescale of few dynamical times. The slowly rotating
non-axisymmetric contribution to the potential required for the onset of
widespread chaotic behavior is remarkably small. Systems consisting of
centrally-concentrated axisymmetric halos and stellar bars thus appear to be
structurally unstable, and small (1%) deviations from perfect axisymmetry
should result in a bar dissolution on a timescale significantly smaller than
the Hubble time. Since halos found in CDM simulations of large scale structure
are both centrally-concentrated and triaxial it is unlikely that stellar bars
embedded in such halos would form and survive unless the halos are modified
during the formation of the baryonic component.

Space Telescope we present the detection of an intermediate-time flux excess
which is redder in color relative to the afterglow of GRB 011121, currently
distinguished as the gamma-ray burst with the lowest known redshift. The red
``bump,'' which exhibits a spectral roll-over at ~7200 Angstrom, is well
described by a redshifted Type Ic supernova that occurred approximately at the
same time as the gamma-ray burst event. The inferred luminosity is about half
that of the bright supernova 1998bw. These results serve as compelling evidence
for a massive star origin of long-duration gamma-ray bursts. Models that posit
a supernova explosion weeks to months preceding the gamma-ray burst event are
excluded by these observations. Finally, we discuss the relationship between
spherical core-collapse supernovae and gamma-ray bursts.

ks observation with the ACIS-I camera on Chandra. The observations target the
Lynx field of SPICES, and contains three known X-ray-emitting clusters out to
z=1.27. Not including the known clusters, in the 17'x17' ACIS-I field we detect
132 sources in the 0.5-2 keV (soft) X-ray band down to a limiting flux of
\~1.7e-16 erg/cm2/s and 111 sources in the 2-10 keV (hard) X-ray band down to a
limiting flux of ~1.3e-15 erg/cm2/s. The combined catalog contains a total of
153 sources, of which 42 are detected only in the soft band and 21 are detected
only in the hard band. Confirming previous Chandra results, we find that the
fainter sources have harder X-ray spectra, providing a consistent solution to
the long-standing `spectral paradox'. From deep optical and near-infrared
follow-up data, 77% of the X-ray sources have optical counterparts to I=24 and
71% of the X-ray sources have near-infrared counterparts to K=20. Four of the
24 sources in the near-IR field are associated with extremely red objects
(EROs; I-K>4). We have obtained spectroscopic redshifts with the Keck
telescopes of 18 of the Lynx Chandra sources. These sources comprise a mix of
broad-lined active galaxies, apparently normal galaxies, and two late-type
Galactic dwarfs. Intriguingly, one Galactic source is identified with an M7
dwarf exhibiting non-transient, hard X-ray emission. We review non-AGN
mechanisms to produce X-ray emission and discuss properties of the Lynx Chandra
sample in relation to other samples of X-ray and non-X-ray sources.

resemblance to the well-known case of NGC 1851. In addition, we detect a third,
smaller grouping of stars on the M75 blue tail, separated from the bulk of the
blue HB stars by a gap spanning about 0.5 mag in V. Such a group of stars may
correspond to the upper part of a very extended, though thinly populated, blue

positions inside seven bright Galactic HII regions. The observed [FeIII] line
ratios are compared with the predictions of different sets of collision
strengths and transition probabilities for this ion to select the atomic data

Fe+ abundances, along with ionization correction factors for the contribution
of Fe3+, obtained from available grids of photoionized models, imply that the
Fe/O ratio in the ionized gas is between 2% and 30% of solar. The Fe abundances
derived for each area are correlated both with the degree of ionization and the
colour excess. A possible explanation is suggested, namely the presence of a
population of small grains, probably originating from the fragmentation of
larger grains. These small grains would release Fe atoms into the gas after the
absorption of energetic photons; the small grains surviving this destruction
process would be swept out of the ionized region by the action of radiation
pressure or stellar winds. An indication of a further and more efficient
destruction agent is given by the high Fe abundance derived for a position
sampling the optical jet H399 in M20, where dust destruction due to shock waves
has presumably taken place.

variable V2051 Oph using the Physical Parameter Eclipse Mapping method in order
to map the gas temperature and surface density of the disc for the first time.
The disc appears optically thick in the central regions and gradually becomes
optically thin towards the disc edge or shows a more and more dominating
temperature inversion in the disc chromosphere. The gas temperatures in the
disc range from about 13500 K near the white dwarf to about 6000 K at the disc
edge. The intermediate part of the disc has temperatures of 9000 K to 6500 K.
  The quiescent disc (chromosphere) shows a prominent bright region with
temperatures of 10500 K around the impact region of the stream from the
secondary with an extension towards smaller azimuths. The disc has a size of
0.53 +- 0.03 R_L1 and a mass accretion rate of between dM/dt = 10^15 g/s to
10^17g/s. The light curves must include an uneclipsed component, a hot
chromosphere and/or a disc wind.
  The PPEM method allows us to determine a new distance of 146+-20pc,
compatible with previous rough estimates. For the white dwarf we then
reconstruct a temperature of 19600 K, if the lower hemisphere of the white
dwarf is occulted by the disc.
  We find that although V2051 Oph is very similar to the SU UMa type dwarf
novae HT Cas, OY Car and Z Cha, there must be a substantial difference in order
to explain its unique light curve. For further details and results see paper.

active nucleus, the spectrum shows emission lines from multi temperature
collisionally ionized gas. The emission lines are significantly broader than
the RGS point-source spectral resolution, and in the cross dispersion direction
the emission lines are detected adjacent to, as well as coincident with, the
active nucleus. This implies that they originate in a region of more than an
arcminute (~ 1 kpc) spatial extent. A good fit to the whole RGS spectrum can be
found using a model consisting of an absorbed power law from the active nucleus
and a 3 temperature thermal plasma. Two of the thermal plasma components have
temperatures of 0.18+-0.04 keV and 0.64+-0.04 keV, characteristic of the hot
interstellar medium produced by supernovae; the combined luminosity of these
two plasma components accounts for all the unresolved bulge X-ray emission seen
in the Chandra observation by Tennant et al (2001). The third component has a
higher temperature (~1.7 keV) and we propose X-ray binaries in the bulge of M81
as the most likely source of this emission.

discs around black holes. This instability is an important issue for most
models of cosmic gamma-ray bursts, where the central engine responsible for the
initial energy release is such a system consisting of a thick disc surrounding
a black hole. We have carried out a comprehensive number of time-dependent
simulations aimed at exploring the appearance of the instability. Our study has
been performed using a fully relativistic hydrodynamics code. The general
relativistic hydrodynamic equations are formulated as a hyperbolic
flux-conservative system and solved using a suitable Godunov-type scheme. We
build a series of constant angular momentum discs around a Schwarzschild black
hole. Furthermore, the self-gravity of the disc is neglected and the evolution
of the central black hole is assumed to be that of a sequence of exact
Schwarzschild black holes of varying mass. The black hole mass increase is thus
determined by the mass accretion rate across the event horizon. In agreement
with previous studies based on stationary models, we find that by allowing the
mass of the black hole to grow the disc becomes unstable. Our hydrodynamical
simulations show that for all disc-to-hole mass ratios considered (between 1
and 0.05), the runaway instability appears very fast on a dynamical timescale
of a few orbital periods, typically a few 10 ms and never exceeding 1 s for our
particular choice of the mass of the black hole ($2.5 \mathrm{M_\odot}$) and a
large range of mass fluxes ($\dot{m} \ga 10^{-3} \mathrm{M_{\odot}/s}$). The
implications of our results in the context of gamma-ray bursts are briefly

the quasi-two-dimensional ruthenium oxide Sr2RuO4 on the basis of
two-dimensional three-band Hubbard model. We solve the linearized Eliashberg
equation by taking into account the full momentum-frequency dependence of the
order parameter for the spin-triplet and the spin-singlet states, and estimate
the transition temperature as a function of the Coulomb integrals. The
effective pairing interaction is expanded perturbatively with respect to the
Coulomb interaction at the Ru sites up to the third order. As a result, we show
that the spin-triplet p-wave state is more stable than the spin-singlet d-wave
state for moderately strong Coulomb interaction. Our results suggest that one
of the three bands, $\gamma$, plays a dominant role in the superconducting
transition, and the pairing on the other two bands($\alpha$ and $\beta$) is
induced passively through the inter-orbit couplings. The most significant
momentum dependence for the p-wave pairing originates from the vertex
correction terms, while the incommensurate antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations,
which are observed in inelastic neutron scattering experiments, are expected to
disturb the p-wave pairing by enhancing the d-wave pairing. Therefore we can
regard the spin-triplet superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 as one of the natural
results of the electron correlations, and cannot consider as a result of some
strong magnetic fluctuations. We will also mention the normal Fermi liquid
properties of Sr2RuO4.

observed structure evolution exhibits complex dynamics. It is characterized by
non-monotonic time variations in an Er-rich fraction respect with an Er-poor
fraction observed experimentally. The present paper proposes a qualitative
model for this non-monotonic structure relaxation. We assume that the alloy
have crystalline defects which trap (or emit) an additional amount of Er atoms.
Hydrogen atoms into the alloy disturb the phase equilibrium as well as change
the defects capacity with respect to Er atoms. Both of these factors lead to
the spatial redistribution of Er atoms and cause the interface between the
Er-rich and the Er-poor phase to move. The competition of diffusion fluxes in
system is responsible for non-monotonic time variations, for example, in the
relative volume of the enriched phase. We have found the conditions when the
interface motion can change its direction several times during the system
relaxation to a new equilibrium state. From our point of view this effect is
the essence of the hydrogen induced non-monotonic relaxation observed in such
systems. The numerical simulation confirms the basic assumptions.

Without being much affected, A first acts on S, whose state collapses in a very
brief time. The mechanism differs from the usual decoherence. Soon after its
irreversibility is achieved. Finally the field induced by S on M, which may
take two opposite values with probabilities given by Born's rule, drives A into

  Numbers","29 pages",,,,"math.CO",,"  A permutation $\pi \in S_n$ is said to {\it avoid} a permutation $\sigma \in
S_k$ whenever $\pi$ contains no subsequence with all of the same pairwise
comparisons as $\sigma$. For any set $R$ of permutations, we write $S_n(R)$ to
denote the set of permutations in $S_n$ which avoid every permutation in $R$.
In 1985 Simion and Schmidt showed that $|S_n(132, 213, 123)|$ is equal to the
Fibonacci number $F_{n+1}$. In this paper we generalize this result in several
ways. We first use a result of Mansour to show that for any permutation $\tau$
in a certain infinite family of permutations, $|S_n(132, 213, \tau)|$ is given
in terms of Fibonacci numbers or $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers. In many
cases we give explicit enumerations, which we prove bijectively. We then use
generating function techniques to show that for any permutation $\gamma$ in a
second infinite family of permutations, $|S_n(123, 132, \gamma)|$ is also given
in terms of Fibonacci numbers or $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers. In many
cases we give explicit enumerations, some of which we prove bijectively. We go
on to use generating function techniques to show that for any permutation
$\omega$ in a third infinite family of permutations, $|S_n(132, 2341, \omega)|$
is given in terms of Fibonacci numbers, and for any permutation $\mu$ in a
fourth infinite family of permutations, $|S_n(132, 3241, \mu)|$ is given in
terms of Fibonacci numbers and $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers. In several
cases we give explicit enumerations. We conclude by giving an infinite class of
examples of a set $R$ of permutations for which $|S_n(R)|$ satisfies a linear
homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients.

dielectric cylindrical rods in air placed normal to the basal plane on vertices
of tiles composing the quasiperiodic pattern. An isotropic photonic band gap
(PBG) appeared in the TM mode, where electric fields were parallel to the rods,
even when the real part of a dielectric constant of the rod was as small as
2.4. An isotropic PBG-like dip was seen in tiny Penrose and octagonal PCs with
only 6 and 9 rods, respectively. These results indicate that local multiple
light scattering within the tiny PC plays an important role in the PBG
formation. Besides the isotropic PBG, we found dips depending on the incident
angle of the light. This is the first report of anisotropic structures clearly
observed in transmission spectra of quasiperiodic PCs. Based on rod-number and
rod-arrangement dependence, it is thought that the shapes and positions of the
anisotropic dips are determined by global multiple light scattering covering
the whole system. In contrast to the isotropic PBG due to local light
scattering, we could not find any PBGs due to global light scattering even
though we studied transmission spectra of a huge Penrose PC with 466 rods.
