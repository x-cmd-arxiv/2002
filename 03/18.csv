frequencies. The radio data are in excellent agreement with that expected for
free-free wind emission. and the ionized mass-loss rate is derived. The X-ray
emission measure distribution shows a dominant contribution from cool plasma at
kT$_{cool}$ = 0.5 keV (6 MK) which is only weakly absorbed. We argue that this
cool emission originates at hundreds of radii if the wind is spherical and
homogeneous and derive shock velocities and the X-ray filling factor using
radiative shock models. A surprising result is the unambiguous detection of a
hard X-ray component clearly seen in the hard-band images and the spectra. This
hard component accounts for about half of the observed flux and can be
acceptably fitted by a hot optically thin thermal plasma or a power-law model.
If the emission is thermal, then a temperature kT$_{hot}$ $\geq$ 3 keV is
derived. Such high temperatures are not predicted by current instability-driven
wind shock models. We examine several alternatives and show that the hard
emission could be accounted for by the WR wind shocking onto a close stellar
companion which has so far escaped detection. However, until persuasive
evidence for binarity is found we are left with the intriguing possibility that
the hard X-ray emission is produced entirely by the Wolf-Rayet star.

Sitter space.
  In this brane-universe cosmology, the Friedmann equation is modified by the
appearance of extra terms which derive from existence of the extra dimensions.
  In the present work we concentrate on the ``dark radiation'' term which
diminishes with cosmic scale factor as $a^{-4}$.
  We show that, although the observational constraints from primordial
abundances allow only a small contribution when this term is positive, a much
wider range of negative values is allowed. Furthermore, such a negative
contribution can reconcile the tension between the observed primordial $\he4$
and D abundances.
  We also discuss the possible constraints on this term from the power spectrum
of CMB anisotropies in the limit of negligible cosmological perturbation on the
brane world. We show that BBN limits the possible contribution from dark
radiation just before the nucleosynthesis epoch to lie between -65% and $+5%$
of the background photon energy density. Combining this with the CMB constraint
reduces this range to between -24% and $+3.5%$ at the $2\sigma$ confidence
level.

F_L in the semi-inclusive region. The dramatic breakdown of the operator
product expansion at large Bjorken x due to the formation of a narrow jet with
invariant mass W (W^2=Q^2(1-x)/x) calls for an alternative approach. Our main
conjecture is that the dominant contribution at each twist is the one which
mixes under renormalization with the leading twist (ultraviolet dominance). At
twist two the dominant perturbative corrections at large x due to soft and
collinear radiation can be factorized into a jet function. From the ultraviolet
dominance conjecture it follows that the twist two parton distribution as well
as the jet function actually factorize to any order in the twist expansion.
This factorization suggests that non-perturbative corrections ~1/W^{2n}
exponentiate together with the leading twist. We verify explicitly, at the
level of a single dressed gluon, the cancellation between ambiguities due to
infrared renormalons in the twist-two coefficient functions and those due to
the ultraviolet divergence of twist-four matrix elements. Independently of the
renormalon analysis, we show that the dominant contribution to twist four at
large x is associated with a twist-two like configuration: the final states are
identical to those of twist two, whereas the initial states differ just by
additional partons carrying small momentum fractions. This picture is
consistent with the ultraviolet dominance conjecture.

introduction about supergravity theories. In the second chapter closed strings
are analyzed, with particular emphasis on type IIB, whose orientifold
projection, in order to build type-I models, is the subject of the third
chapter. Original results are reported in chapters 4 and 5. In chapter 4 we
describe the complete coupling of (1,0) six-dimensional supergravity to tensor,
vector and hypermultiplets. The generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism implies
that the resulting theory embodies factorized gauge and supersymmetry
anomalies, to be disposed of by fermion loops. Consequently, the low-energy
theory is determined by the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions, rather than by
the requirement of supersymmetry, and this procedure does not fix a quartic
coupling for the gauginos. In chapter 5 we describe the low-energy effective
actions for type-I models with brane supersymmetry breaking, resulting form the
simultaneous presence of supersymmetric bulks, with one or more gravitinos, and
non-supersymmetric combinations of BPS branes.The consistency of the resulting
gravitino couplings implies that local supersymmetry is non-linearly realized
on some branes. We analyze in detail the ten-dimensional $USp(32)$ model and
the six-dimensional (1,0) models.

  Postscript file, submitted to Res. Population Ecology",,,,"nlin.AO cond-mat.stat-mech physics.bio-ph q-bio.PE",,"  A mechanism of sympatric speciation is presented based on the
interaction-induced developmental plasticity of phenotypes. First, phenotypes
of individuals with identical genotypes split into a few groups, according to
instability in the developmental dynamics that are triggered with the
competitive interaction among individuals. Then, through mutational change of
genes, the phenotypic differences are fixed to genes, until the groups are
completely separated in genes as well as phenotypes. It is also demonstrated
that the proposed theory leads to hybrid sterility under sexual recombination,
and thus speciation is completed in the sense of reproductive isolation. As a
result of this post-mating isolation, the mating preference evolves later. When
there are two alleles, the correlation between alleles is formed, to
consolidate the speciation. When individuals are located in space, different
species are later segregated spatially, implying that the speciation so far
regarded to be allopatric may be a result of sympatric speciation.
Relationships with previous theories, frequency-dependent selection,
reinforcement, Baldwin's effect, phenotypic plasticity, and resource
competition are briefly discussed. Relevance of the results to natural
evolution are discussed, including punctuated equilibrium, incomplete
penetrance in mutants, and the change in flexibility in genotype-phenotype
correspondence. Finally, it is discussed how our theory is confirmed both in
field and in laboratory (in an experiment with the use of E coli.).

replication, exceeds a certain threshold. We study how the chemicals in a
catalytic network can form recursive production states in the presence of
errors in the replication process. Depending on the balance between the total
number of molecules in a cell and the number of molecule species, we have found
three phases; a phase without a recursive production state, a phase with
itinerancy over a few recursive states, and a phase with fixed recursive
production states. Heredity is realized in the latter two phases where molecule
species that are population-wise in the minority are preserved and control the
phenotype of the cell. It is shown that evolvability is realized in the
itinerancy phase, where a change in the number of minority molecules controls a
change of the chemical state.

, we show how to use an identification and replacement process to construct a
unique, unitary particle-antiparticle amplitude. This process differs from
conventional on-shell Mandelstam s,t,u crossing in that the input and
constructed amplitudes can be off-diagonal and off-energy shell. Further,
amplitudes are constructed using the invariant parameters which are appropriate
to use as driving terms in the multi-particle, multichannel non-perturbative,
cluster decomposable, relativistic scattering equations of the Faddeev-type
integral equations recently presented by Alfred, Kwizera, Lindesay and Noyes.
It is therefore anticipated that when so employed, the resulting multi-channel
solutions will also be unitary. The process preserves the usual
particle-antiparticle symmetries. To illustrate this process, we construct a
J=0 scattering length model chosen for simplicity. We also exhibit a class of
physical models which contain a finite quantum mass parameter and are Lorentz
invariant. These are constructed to reduce in the appropriate limits, and with
the proper choice of value and sign of the interaction parameter, to the
asymptotic solution of the non-relativistic Coulomb problem, including the
forward scattering singularity, the essential singularity in the phase, and the
Bohr bound-state spectrum.

cannot be absorbed quickly by matter, so that it remains a zero point field.
Splitting the total, genuine electromagnetic field into the sum of a
conventional field and a zero point field is physically meaningless until a
receiver attenuates the genuine field down to the zero point field, or studying
the amplification of the zero point field by a source.
  In classical optics all optical effects must be written using the genuine
field, so that at low light levels the nonlinear effects become linear in
relation to the conventional field. The result of the interpretation of all
observations, even at low light levels, is exactly the same in quantum
electrodynamics and in the semi- classical theory.
  The zero point field is stochastic only far from the sources and the
receivers; elsewhere, it is shaped by matter, it may be studied through fields
visible before an absorption or after an amplification.
  A classical study of the reduction of the wave packet extends the domain of
equivalence of the classical and quantum zero point field; using both
interpretations of this field makes the results more reliable, because the
traps are different.

``which-way'' experiment, caused by an environmental interaction, may be viewed
as the destruction of first-order coherence as defined by Glauber many years
ago (Glauber). However, the influence of an environment can also destroy the
$n$th-order quantum coherence in a quantum system, where this high order
coherence is captured. We refer to this phenomenon as the $n$% th-order
decoherence. In this paper we show that, just as the first-order coherence can
be understood as the interference of the amplitudes for two distinct paths, the
higher order coherence may be understood as the interference of multiple
amplitudes corresponding to multiple paths. To see this, we introduce the
concept of $n$th-order ``multi-particle wave amplitude''. It turns out that the
$n$th-order correlation function can be expressed as the square norm of some
``multi-particle wave amplitude'' for the closed system or as the sum of such
square norms for the open system. We also examine, as a specific example, how
an environment can destroy the second order coherence by eliminating the
interference between various multiple paths.

is allowed since, as it happens in every quantum theory for spin-1/2 particles,
the momentum operator (that is conserved) and the velocity operator (that is
not) are independent operators, which refer to independent quantities. As a
consequence, at variance with ordinary Dirac particles, for PT's the average
velocity is not equal to the classical velocity, but actually to the velocity
""dual"" of the classical velocity. The speed of PT's is therefore smaller than
the speed of light. Since a lot of experimental data seems to involve a
negative mass squared for neutrinos, we suggest that these particles might be
PT's, travelling, because of their very small mass, at subluminal speeds very
close to c. The present theory is shown to be separately invariant under the C,
P, T transformations; the covariance under Lorentz transformations is also
proved. Furthermore, we derive the kinematical constraints linking 4-impulse,
