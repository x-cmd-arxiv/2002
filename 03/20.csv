cosmological constant) seem to dominate the Universe. Thus its direct detection
is central to particle physics and cosmology. Supersymmetry provides a natural
dark matter candidate, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). One
essential ingredient in obtaining the direct detection rates is the density and
velocity distribution of the LSP. The detection rate is proportional to this
density in our vicinity. Furthermore, since this rate is expected to be very
low, one should explore the two characteristic signatures of the process,
namely the modulation effect, i.e. the dependence of the event rate on the
Earth's motion and the correlation of the directional rate with the motion of
the sun. Both of these crucially depend on the LSP velocity distribution. In
the present paper we study simultaneously density profiles and velocity
distributions based on the Eddington theory.

models for CMB spectra distorted by a single or two heating processes at
different cosmic times. The constraints on the fractional energy injected in
the radiation field, DE/E, are mainly provided by the FIRAS instrument aboard
the COBE satellite. Under the hypothesis that two heating processes have
occurred at different epochs, the limits on DE/E are relaxed by a factor 2 both
for the earlier and the later process with respect to the case in which a
single energy injection in the thermal history of the universe is considered.
In general, the constraints on DE/E are weaker for early processes than for
relatively late processes, because of the wavelength coverage of FIRAS data.
  We considered also the FIRAS calibration as revised by Battistelli et al.
2000, that, in the case of the favourite calibrator emissivity law proposed by
the authors, implies significant deviations from a planckian spectrum. An
astrophysical explanation of this, although intriguing, seems difficult, both
in terms of CMB spectral distortions and in terms of a relevant millimetric
foreground.
  Future precise measurements at longer wavelengths as well as current and
future CMB anisotropy space missions will provide independent, direct or
indirect, cross checks.

Here we investigate whether thermal conduction operating over those gradients

(2001) and Gruzinov (2002) have noted, using published results on cluster
temperatures, that conduction within a factor of a few of the Spitzer rate is
sufficient to balance bremsstrahlung cooling. From a detailed study of the
temperature and emission measure profiles of Abell 2199 and Abell 1835, we find
that the heat flux required by conduction is consistent with or below the rate
predicted by Spitzer in the outer regions of the core. Conduction may therefore
explain the lack of observational evidence for large mass cooling rates
inferred from arguments based simply on radiative cooling, provided that
conductivity is suppressed by no more than a factor of three below the full
Spitzer rate. To stem cooling in the cluster centre, however, would necessitate
conductivity values at least a factor of two larger than the Spitzer values,
which we consider implausible. This may provide an explanation for the observed
star formation and optical nebulosities in cluster cores. The solution is
likely to be time dependent. We briefly discuss the possible origin of the
cooler gas and the implications for massive galaxies.

The relative proper motion of a caustic-crossing binary lens can be measured
with observations from a single terrestrial telescope. Thus, uniquely, binary
lenses can be completely solved with only the addition of a measurement of the
microlensing parallax. This solution will yield the mass, distance, and
transverse velocity of the lens relative to the source. To date, only one of
the $\sim 1000$ observed microlensing events has been so solved.
  We examine the ability of a parallax satellite combined with ground-based
observations to solve these events. To measure both components of the vector
parallax, the lens must be observed near two different caustics. Thus, the
final accuracy is determined mostly by whether one can intensively monitor part
of the first caustic crossing, by the magnification pattern, and by the path of
the source with respect to the lens geometry. We find that vector parallaxes
can be measured far more easily for binary lenses than single lenses, requiring
1-3 orders of magnitude fewer photons. They may thus yield a large number of
completely solved lenses relatively cheaply.

produced by gas with a wider range of temperatures and the lower densities of
unvirialized structures; they could also detect X-ray forest absorption by C,
N, Ne, Fe, and possibly Si. If the IGM metallicity is 0.1 solar, then the
predicted number of systems strong enough for a ~5\sigma detection with Chandra
or XMM-Newton is extremely low, though scatter in metallicity would increase
the number of strong absorbers even if the mean metallicity remained the same.
Our simulation reproduces the high observed incidence of OVI absorbers (in the
UV), and the most promising strategy for finding the X-ray forest is to search
at the redshifts of known OVI systems, thus reducing the signal-to-noise
threshold required for a significant detection. However, while many OVI
absorbers have associated OVII or OVIII absorption, the OVI systems trace only
the low temperature phases of the X-ray forest, and a full accounting of the
strong OVII and OVIII systems will require a mission with the anticipated
capabilities of Constellation-X. The large effective area of the XEUS satellite
would make it an extremely powerful instrument for studying the IGM, measuring
X-ray forest absorption by a variety of elements and revealing the shock-heated
filaments that may be an important reservoir of cosmic baryons.

low-frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) of X-ray binaries, in particular
those hosting a black hole. We discuss and repeat the recent analysis and
spectral modelling of the micro-quasar GRO J1655 by Sobczak et al (2000,

analyze in more detail the different behavior noted by SMR, between GRO J1655

the disk inner radius. In a companion paper (Varniere et al., 2002, hereafter

  We thus propose that the difference between GRO J1655 and other sources comes
from the fact that in the former, observed in a very high state, the disk inner
radius always stays close to the Last Stable Orbit.
  In the course of this analysis, we also indicate interesting differences
between the source properties, when the spectral fits give an anomalously low
inner disk radius. This might indicate the presence of a spiral shock or a hot

  Relativistic effects","accepted by A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20020401",,"astro-ph",,"  The Accretion-Ejection Instability has been proposed to explain the low
frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) observed in low-mass X-Ray Binaries,
in particular Black-Hole candidates. Its frequency, typically a fraction of the
Keplerian frequency at the disk inner radius, is exactly in the range indicated
by observations. The variations of the frequency with the disk inner radius
(extracted from spectral fits of the X-ray emission) might thus be a useful
test. In this paper we discuss how changes in the rotation curve, due to
relativistic effects when the disk approaches the central object, affect the
physics of the instability, and thus this frequency-inner radius relation. We
find that the relationship between the frequency of the mode and the Keplerian
frequency at the inner disk radius ($r_{int}$) departs from the one obtained in
a Keplerian disk, when $r_{int}$ approaches the last stable orbit. This might
agree with the recently published results, showing a discrepancy between the
behavior of the QPO in the micro quasar GRO J1655, compared to other sources
such as XTE J1550 and GRS 1915.

radius (assumed to be close to its inner radius) and the QPO frequency could
indeed be explained by our theoretical result.

investigate the long-term period evolution, covering 340 years, going back to
its discovery in AD 1662. Wavelets are used to determine both the period and
semi-amplitude. We show that the period decreased linearly between 1770 and
1950; since 1950 the period has stabilized at 385 days. The semi-amplitude
closely follows the period evolution. Detailed analysis of the oldest data
shows that before 1770 the period was about 495 days. We find no evidence for
an increasing period during this time as found by Wood & Zarro. IRAS data shows
that the mass loss dropped dramatically around AD 1750. The decline agrees with
the mass-loss formalism from Vassiliadis & Wood, but is much larger than
predicted by the Bloecker mass-loss law. An outer detached IRAS shell suggests
that R Hya has experienced such mass-loss interruptions before. The period
evolution can be explained by a thermal pulse occuring around AD 1600, or by an
non-linear instability leading to an internal relaxation of the stellar
structure. The elapsed time between the mass-loss decline giving rise to the
outer detached shell, and the recent event, of approximately 5000 yr suggests
that only one of these events could be due to a thermal pulse. Further
monitoring of R Hya is recommended, as both models make strong predictions for
the future period evolution. R Hya-type events, on time scales of 10^2-10^3 yr,
could provide part of the explanation for the rings seen around some AGB and

the two-zone approximation. The disk is divided into an underlying disk and a
corona, where the latter is defined as the upper surface layers for which the
effective optical depth is unity. It is found that a significant part of the
accretion flow (or dissipation rate) can take place in the corona if the scale
height of the magnetic field is larger than that of the disk. The presence of
such a dissipative corona leads to a modification in the topology of local disk
solutions. For example, these solutions are found from local stability analysis
to be both secularly and thermally stable, for accretion rates which are a
factor $\approx$ four higher than those inferred from the stability of standard
disk solutions. Thus, the applicability of optically thick disks with
dissipative coronas are not as restrictive as disks without such coronas and
can provide an attractive explanation for the origin of the soft spectral
component observed in black hole X-ray binary systems.

at z=0.18, using the LDSS++ spectrograph on the AAT. We obtained spectra
covering redshifted H-alpha for 522 galaxies brighter than I=22.5, covering a
field of 8.7'X8.7'. We detect H-alpha emission in 46 of these galaxies;
accounting for selection effects due to sampling and cluster membership, we
determine that 24% of cluster members brighter than M_R=-16.5+5log(h) are
detected with H-alpha flux greater than 4h^{-2}X 10^{38} ergs/s. This
corresponds to a limiting star formation rate of 0.008 h^{-2} Msun/yr, assuming
1 magnitude of dust extinction. From a Hubble Space Telescope mosaic covering
7.5' X 10.0', we determine morphologies for 199 galaxies brighter than I=21,
and find that 20% of the cluster members are of type Sa or later. More than 90%
of cluster spirals show H-alpha emission, compared with less than 10% of E and
S0 galaxies. The cluster H-alpha luminosity function has a low normalisation
relative to the z~0.2 field, by ~50%, after accounting for the different
fraction of spiral galaxies in the two environments. When compared with local
field galaxies, this suggests that star formation activity is suppressed in
early-type cluster galaxies, relative to their field counterparts. Our sample
includes 29 galaxies previously observed with ISOCAM at 6 and 15 microns. We
detect all 15-micron sources at H-alpha, so there is no evidence for any star
formation completely hidden at H-alpha. Comparing the 15-micron and H-alpha
fluxes, we find evidence that some mid-infrared-detected galaxies could be
obscured by as much as 3 magnitudes of extinction at H-alpha, although this
depends on the largely unknown contribution from any AGN-heated dust to the
mid-infrared flux.

X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). Most of these observations were spaced by less

and by the PCA in the 2-16 keV range but at different times. During the closely
spaced RXTE observations beginning on 2000 July 28, an ending of one flare and
a start of another are visible, associated with spectral changes, where the
photon index Gamma ranges between ~ 1.4 and 1.7, and the spectrum is harder
when the source is brighter. This implies that 1ES1959 is an XBL-type blazar,
with the X-ray emission likely to originate via the synchrotron process. The
USA observations reveal another flare that peaked on 2000 November 14 and
doubled the flux within a few days, again associated with spectral changes of
the same form. The spectral variability correlated with the flux and timing
characteristics of this object that are similar to those of other nearby BL
Lacs, and suggest relativistic beaming with a Doppler factor delta > 1.6 and
magnetic fields of the order of a few mG. We also suggest that the steady
component of the X-ray emission -- present in this object as well as in other
XBLs -- may be due to the large-scale relativistic jet (such as measured by
Chandra in many radio-loud AGN), but pointing very closely to our line of

galaxies brighter than M_b=-19 (LCDM) at 0.05<z<0.1 in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift
Survey (2dF), in the fields of seventeen known galaxy clusters. The limited
redshift range ensures that our results are insensitive to aperture bias, and
to residuals from night sky emission lines. We use these measurements to trace
mustar, the star formation rate normalized to Lstar, as a function of distance
from the cluster centre, and local projected galaxy density. We find that the
distribution of mustar steadily skews toward larger values with increasing
distance from the cluster centre, converging to the field distribution at
distances greater than ~3 times the virial radius. A correlation between star
formation rate and local projected density is also found, which is independent
of cluster velocity dispersion and disappears at projected densities below ~1
galaxy (brighter than M_b=-19) per Mpc^2. This characteristic scale corresponds
approximately to the mean density at the cluster virial radius. The same
correlation holds for galaxies more than two virial radii from the cluster
centre. We conclude that environmental influences on galaxy properties are not
restricted to cluster cores, but are effective in all groups where the density
exceeds this critical value. The present day abundance of such systems, and the
strong evolution of this abundance, makes it likely that hierarchical growth of
structure plays a significant role in decreasing the global average star
formation rate. Finally, the low star formation rates well beyond the
virialised cluster rule out severe physical processes, such as ram pressure
stripping of disk gas, as being completely responsible for the variations in
galaxy properties with environment.

delivered to the wall of a 2D hopper by a granular medium flowing through it.
The forces are predominantly impulsive at all flow rates for which the flow
does not permanently jam. The average impulse delivered to the wall is much
larger than the momentum acquired by a single particle under gravity between
collisions, reflecting the fact that momentum is transferred to the walls from
the bulk of the flow by collisions. At values larger than the average impulse,
the probability distribution of impulses is broad and decays exponentially on
the scale of the average impulse, just as it does in static granular media. At
small impulse values, the probability distribution evolves continuously with
flow velocity but does not show a clear signature of the transition from purely
collisional flow to intermittently jamming flows. However, the time interval
between collisions tends to a power law distribution, $P(\tau)\sim
\tau^{-3/2}$, thus showing a clear dynamical signature of the approach to
jamming.

500 correlation functions, where each correlation function is started at a
different time.
  The correlation functions are calculated in real time and are referenced to a
unique starting time.
  The multispeckle nature of the CCD camera detector means that a true ensemble
average is calculated; no time averaging is necessary.
  The technique thus provides a ""snapshot"" of the dynamics, making it
particularly useful for non-stationary systems where the dynamics are changing
with time.
  Delay times spanning the range from 1 ms to 1000 s are readily achieved with
this method.

diffusing-wave spectroscopy theory applies.

technique that can measure faster decay times.

has been explicitly incorporated into the calculations as it affects
ionizations from the valence band. A Monte-Carlo model was constructed to
describe the path of electrons following the impact of a single electron of
energy E 250 eV. The results show the evolution of the secondary electron
cascades in terms of the number of electrons liberated, the spatial
distribution of these electrons, and the energy distribution among the
electrons as a function of time. The predicted ionization rates (5-13 electrons
in 100 fs) lie within the limits given by experiments and phenomenological
models. Calculation of the local electron density and the corresponding Debye
length shows that the latter is systematically larger than the radius of the
electron cloud. This means that the electron gas generated does not represent a
plasma in a single impact cascade triggered by an electron of E 250 eV energy.
This is important as it justifies the independent-electron approximation used
in the model. At 1 fs, the (average) spatial distribution of secondary
electrons is anisotropic with the electron cloud elongated in the direction of
the primary impact. The maximal radius of the cascade is about 50 A at this
time. As the system cools, energy is distributed more equally, and the spatial
distribution of the electron cloud becomes isotropic. At 90 fs maximal radius
is about 150 A. The Monte-Carlo model described here could be adopted for the
investigation of radiation damage in other insulators and has implications for
planned experiments with intense femtosecond X-ray sources.

Kondo-lattice model is investigated as a candidate for a proper representation
of local-moment ferromagnets. Magnetic and electronic key-quantities as the
Curie-temperature and the quasiparticle density of states are derived with
previously tested many-body procedures. It is shown that the magnetic
properties can be interpreted exclusively in terms of the temperature-dependent
electronic quasiparticle structure. An extended RKKY theory leads to effective
Heisenberg exchange integrals, which turn out to be functionals of the
conduction electron selfenergy, getting therewith a remarkable temperature and
band occupation dependence.
  In a second step the model studies are combined with tight binding-LMTO
bandstructure calculations in order to get for real ferromagnetic films
quasiparticle densities of states and quasiparticle bandstructures. The
proposed method avoids the double-counting of relevant interactions and takes
into account the correct symmetry of the atomic orbitals. Special results are
given for thin ferromagnetic EuO (100) films. The Curie temperature
$T_{\textrm{C}}$ of the EuO film turns out to be strongly thickness-dependent,
starting from a very low value ($\simeq 15K$) for the monolayer and reaching
the bulk value at about 30 layers. For a 20-layer film we predict the existence
of a surface state, the temperature-behaviour of which can lead to a surface

random walk algorithms to draw samples which follow such distributions. In
addition, we can measure the probability that a page about one broad topic will
link to another broad topic. Extending this experiment, we can measure how
quickly topic context is lost while walking randomly on the Web graph.
Estimates of this topic mixing distance may explain why a global PageRank is

neutrino mass obtained in this way is fairly robust against variations in

universal radio background, and the extragalactic magnetic field, within their
anticipated uncertainties. Much stronger systematics arises from different
possible assumptions about the diffuse background of ordinary cosmic rays from
unresolved astrophysical sources. In the most plausible case that these
ordinary cosmic rays are protons of extragalactic origin, one is lead to a
required neutrino mass in the range 0.08 eV - 1.3 eV at the 68 % confidence

background is assumed, e.g. to 0.08 eV - 0.40 eV for a large one. The required

on the so called extended moduli space of string theory can not be physical -
in the sense that it does not survive the inclusion of general nonperturbative
vacua given by boundary conditions on the level of two dimensional conformal
field theory - but has to be extended to a quantum symmetry given by a
self-dual, noncommutative, and noncocommutative Hopf algebra. First, we show
that a class of two dimensional boundary conformal field theories always
uniquely defines a trialgebra and find the above mentioned Hopf algebra as the
universal symmetry of such trialgebras (in analogy to the definition of GT as
the universal symmetry of quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebras). Second, we

found in a more geometric picture using the language of gerbes.

algebras L(E) for reflexive Banach spaces E, as well as all biduals of Arens
regular Banach algebras. The general impression is that amenable, dual Banach
algebras are rather the exception than the rule. We confirm this impression. We
first show that under certain conditions an amenable dual Banach algebra is
already super-amenable and thus finite-dimensional. We then develop two notions
of amenability - Connes-amenability and strong Connes-amenability - which take
the $w^\ast$-topology on dual Banach algebras into account. We relate the
amenability of an Arens regular Banach algebra A to the (strong)
Connes-amenability of $A^{\ast\ast}$; as an application, we show that there are
reflexive Banach spaces with the approximation property such that L(E) is not

compact groups in terms of their algebras of pseudo-measures. Finally, we give

fit to available experimental data on photoproduction of $\omega$ meson in the

different observables in $\gamma+N\to\omega+N^{*}(1440)$. Numerical results

$\pi$-exchange while effects of nucleon and $N^{*}(1440)$ pole terms can be

Filter approach for atmospheric data assimilation. Our scheme is based on the
hypothesis that, when the Earth's surface is divided up into local regions of
moderate size, vectors of the forecast uncertainties in such regions tend to
lie in a subspace of much lower dimension than that of the full atmospheric
state vector of such a region. Ensemble Kalman Filters, in general, assume that
the analysis resulting from the data assimilation lies in the same subspace as
the expected forecast error. Under our hypothesis the dimension of this
subspace is low. This implies that operations only on relatively low
dimensional matrices are required. Thus, the data analysis is done locally in a
manner allowing massively parallel computation to be exploited. The local
analyses are then used to construct global states for advancement to the next
forecast time. The method, its potential advantages, properties, and
implementation requirements are illustrated by numerical experiments on the
Lorenz-96 model. It is found that accurate analysis can be achieved at a cost
which is very modest compared to that of a full global ensemble Kalman Filter.

feedback to realize the whole class of field-quadrature quantum nondemolition
measurements, from Von Neumann projective measurement to fully non-destructive
non-informative one. In our setup, the signal under investigation is mixed with
a squeezed probe in an interferometer and, at the output, one of the two modes
is revealed through homodyne detection. The second beam is then
amplitude-modulated according to the outcome of the measurement, and finally
squeezed according to the transmittivity of the interferometer. Using strongly
squeezed or anti-squeezed probes respectively, one achieves either a projective
measurement, i.e. homodyne statistics arbitrarily close to the intrinsic
quadrature distribution of the signal, and conditional outputs approaching the
corresponding eigenstates, or fully non-destructive one, characterized by an
almost uniform homodyne statistics, and by an output state arbitrarily close to
the input signal. By varying the squeezing between these two extremes, or
simply by tuning the internal phase-shift of the interferometer, the whole set
of intermediate cases can also be obtained. In particular, an optimal quantum
nondemolition measurement of quadrature can be achieved, which minimizes the
information gain versus state disturbance trade-off.

interferometer when combined with a third differential delay element at the
receiver. The protocol is characterized by a high efficiency, reduced exposure
to an attack by an eavesdropper, and higher sensitivity to such an attack when
compared to other QKD schemes. For example, the efficiency with which
transmitted data contribute to the private key is 3/4 compared with 1/4 for
BB84 [2]. Moreover, an eavesdropper can aquire a maximum of 1/3 of the key
which leads to an error probability in the private key of 1/3. This can be
compared to 1/2 and 1/4 for these same parameters in both BB84 and IWY. The
combination of these considerations should lead to increased range and key
distribution rate over present fiber-based QKD schemes.
