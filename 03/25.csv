accretion flows by solving radiation transfer as well as the energy equations
of radiation and gas. It is found that the slim-disk model generally
overestimates the luminosity of the disk at around the Eddington luminosity
(L_E) and is not accurate in describing the effective temperature profile,
since it neglects time delay between energy generation at deeper inside the
disk and energy release at the surface. Especially, the photon-trapping effects
are appreciable even below L ~ L_E, while they appear above ~ 3L_E according to
the slim disk. Through the photon-trapping effects, the luminosity is reduced
and the effective temperature profile becomes flatter than r^{-3/4} as in the
standard disk. In the case that the viscous heating is effective only around
the equatorial plane, the luminosity is kept around the Eddington luminosity
even at very large mass accretion rate, Mdot>>L_E/c^2. The effective
temperature profile is almost flat, and the maximum temperature decreases in
accordance with rise in the mass accretion rate. Thus, the most luminous radius
shifts to the outer region when Mdot/(L_E/c^2) >> 10^2. In the case that the
energy is dissipated equally at any heights, the resultant luminosity is
somewhat larger than in the former case, but the energy-conversion efficiency
still decreases with increase of the mass accretion rate, as well. The most
luminous radius stays around the inner edge of the disk in the latter case.
Hence, the effective temperature profile is sensitive to the vertical
distribution of energy production rates, so is the spectral shape. Future
observations of high L/L_E objects will be able to test our model.

lived structure than previously assumed. The whole disk-like structure of the

CND shows the observed disk height structure. In a second step the environment
of the CND is taken into account. Retrograde and prograde encounters of a cloud
of several 10^4 M_solar falling onto an already existing nuclear disk using
different energy loss rates per collision are simulated. The influence of the
energy loss rate per collision on the evolution of the mass accretion and cloud
collision rates is strongest for a prograde encounter. A composite data cube of
two different snapshots of a prograde encounter together with the CND shows
striking similarity with the observed Sgr A cloud complex. The current
appearance of the Galactic Centre environment can thus be explained by at least
two dynamically distinct features together with the CND. The current mass
accretion rate within the CND ranges between 10^-3 and 10^-4 M_solar yr^-1. It
can rise up to several 10^-2 M_solar yr^-1 during massive accretion events.

Two methods for density diagnostics are applied. The He-like triplets from NVII

only assuming that the emitting plasma is immersed in the radiation field. For
the high temperature He-like ions only low density limits are found. Using
ratios of FeXXI lines produced at similar temperatures are sensitive to lower
densities but again yield only low density limits. We thus conclude that the
hot plasma has densities below 10^12 cm^-3. Assuming a constant pressure corona

We search for X-ray emission from point sources as well as for diffuse
emission, down to the detection limit of the ROSAT data. Using X-ray hardness
ratio diagrams we differentiate between thermal plasma and power-law X-ray
spectra which helps to determine the nature of the individual sources.
Correlating the X-ray data with complementary observations ranging from the
far-ultraviolet to the radio regime we increase the probability of correctly
identifying sources belonging to Holmberg II. We did not detect soft X-ray
emission originating from hot gas within supergiant HI shells above our
luminosity sensitivity limit of (L_limit(0.1 - 2.1 keV) ~ 10^{37}erg/s). This
finding can probably be attributed to blow-out in the case of the largest holes
and insufficient sensitivity (due to strong photoelectric absorption) in case
of the smaller HI holes. However we find faint X-ray sources well beyond the
stellar body but within the HI distribution of Holmberg II, which suggests the
presence of X-ray binaries. This indicates that star formation has taken place
across the entire gaseous disk of Holmberg II in the past, some of which may
have created the structures seen in the ISM at large galactocentric radii.

quantizations of the classical multibaker models previously considered by

parametrizing the quantization, we consider only two classes of the QMB maps:
uniform and random. Uniform QMB maps are characterized by phases which are the
same in every unit cell of the multibaker chain. Random QMB maps have phases
that vary randomly from unit cell to unit cell. The eigenstates in the former
case are extended while in the latter they are localized. In the uniform case
and for large $\hbar$, analytic solutions can be obtained for the time
dependent quantum states for periodic chains and for open chains with absorbing
boundary conditions. Steady state solutions and the properties of the
relaxation to a steady state for a uniform QMB chain in contact with
``particle'' reservoirs can also be described analytically. The analytical
results are consistent with, and confirmed by, results obtained from numerical
methods. We report here results for the deep quantum regime (large $\hbar$) of
the uniform QMB, as well as some results for the random QMB. We leave the
moderate and small $\hbar$ results as well as further consideration of the

the Omori law (power law decay ~1/t^{1+\theta} of seismicity after an

use in addition a power law distribution ~1/r^{1+\mu} of distances between
triggered and triggering earthquakes. We present an exact mapping between the
ETAS model and a class of CTRW (continuous time random walk) models, based on
the identification of their corresponding Master equations. This mapping allows
us to use the wealth of results previously obtained on anomalous diffusion of
CTRW. We provide a classification of the different regimes of diffusion of
seismic activity triggered by a mainshock. Specifically, we derive the relation
between the average distance between aftershocks and the mainshock as a
function of the time from the mainshock and of the joint probability
distribution of the times and locations of the aftershocks. Our predictions are
checked by careful numerical simulations. We stress the distinction between the
``bare'' Omori law describing the seismic rate activated directly by a
mainshock and the ``renormalized'' Omori law taking into account all possible
cascades from mainshocks to aftershocks of aftershock of aftershock, and so on.
In particular, we predict that seismic diffusion or sub-diffusion occurs and
should be observable only when the observed Omori exponent is less than 1,
because this signals the operation of the renormalization of the bare Omori
law, also at the origin of seismic diffusion in the ETAS model.

provides a natural explanation for many of the key features of protein

obtains marginally compact structures, which are relatively few in number

to be explicitly time-dependent and can be expressed as a formal rotation of
two cubic polynomial functions, $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$, of the canonical variables
(q,p).
  We investigate the role of these fouled Hamiltonians at the quantum level.
Adopting a canonical quantization procedure, we construct some quantum models
and analyze the related eigenvalue equations. One of these models is described
by a Hamiltonian admitting infinite self-adjoint extensions, each of them has a
discrete spectrum on the real line. A self-adjoint extension is fixed by
choosing the spectral parameter $\epsilon$ of the associated eigenvalue
equation equal to zero. The spectral problem is discussed in the context of
three different representations. For $\epsilon =0$, the eigenvalue equation is
exactly solved in all these representations, in which square-integrable
solutions are explicity found. A set of constants of motion corresponding to
these quantum models is also obtained. Furthermore, the algebraic structure
underlying the quantum models is explored. This turns out to be a nonlinear
(quadratic) algebra, which could be applied for the determination of
approximate solutions to the eigenvalue equations.
