flux-limited samples of z~4.3 and z>5.8 quasars, recently published by the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our main findings are: (i) The lensing
probability should be 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than for conventional
surveys. The expected fraction of multiply-imaged quasars is highly sensitive
to redshift and the uncertain slope of the bright end of the luminosity
function, beta_h. For beta_h=2.58 (3.43) we find that at z~4.3 and i*<20.0 the
fraction is ~4% (13%) while at z~6 and z*<20.2 the fraction is ~7% (30%). (ii)
The distribution of magnifications is heavily skewed; sources having the
redshift and luminosity of the SDSS z>5.8 quasars acquire median magnifications
of med(mu_obs)~1.1-1.3 and mean magnifications of <mu_obs>~5-50. Estimates of
the quasar luminosity density at high redshift must therefore filter out
gravitationally-lensed sources. (iii) The flux in the Gunn-Peterson trough of
the highest redshift (z=6.28) quasar is known to be f_lambda<3 10^-19
erg/sec/cm^2/Angstrom. Should this quasar be multiply imaged, we estimate a 40%
chance that light from the lens galaxy would have contaminated the same part of
the quasar spectrum with a higher flux. Hence, spectroscopic studies of the
epoch of reionization need to account for the possibility that a lens galaxy,
which boosts the quasar flux, also contaminates the Gunn-Peterson trough. (iv)
Microlensing by stars should result in ~1/3 of multiply imaged quasars in the
z>5.8 catalog varying by more than 0.5 magnitudes over the next decade. The
median equivalent width would be lowered by ~20% with respect to the intrinsic
value due to differential magnification of the continuum and emission-line
regions.

distance is known from trigonometric parallax. The distance from the relation

4% but is still marginally within the combined errors. Both distances are well
within the errors of the distance derived from trigonometric parallax.

of 0.6 square degrees in 173 fields probing independent lines of sight, hence
minimising the impact of sample variance. We also extend our measurements of
cosmic shear with the William Herschel Telescope (Bacon, Refregier & Ellis
2000) to a survey area of 1 square degree. The joint measurements with two
independent telescopes allow us to assess the impact of instrument-specific
systematics, one of the major difficulties in cosmic shear measurements. For
both surveys, we carefully account for effects such as smearing by the point
spread function and shearing due to telescope optics. We find negligible
residuals in both cases and recover mutually consistent cosmic shear signals,
significant at the 5.1 sigma level. We present a simple method to compute the
statistical error in the shear correlation function, including non-gaussian
sample variance and the covariance between different angular bins. We measure
shear correlation functions for all fields and use these to ascertain the
amplitude of the matter power spectrum, finding sigma_8 (Omega_m/0.3)^0.68 =
0.97 \pm 0.13 with 0.14<Omega_m<0.65 in a Lambda-CDM model with Gamma=0.21.
These 68% CL uncertainties include sample variance, statistical noise, redshift
uncertainty, and the error in the shear measurement method. The results from
our two independent surveys are both consistent with measurements of cosmic
shear from other groups. We discuss how our results compare with current
normalisation from cluster abundance.

Sgr in the Galaxy and HV 2671 in the LMC. These stars have in common random
deep declines in visual brightness which are characteristic for R Coronae
Borealis (RCB) stars. RCB stars are typically cool, hydrogen deficient
supergiants. The four stars studied in this paper are hotter (T$_{\rm eff}$ =
15-20 kK) than the majority of RCB stars (T$_{\rm eff}$ = 5000-7000 K).
Although these are commonly grouped together as the \emph{hot RCB stars} they
do not necessarily share a common evolutionary history. We present new
observational data and an extensive collection of archival and
previously-published data which is reassessed to ensure internal consistency.
We find temporal variations of various properties on different time scales
which will eventually help us to uncover the evolutionary history of these
objects. DY Cen and MV Sgr have typical RCB helium abundances which excludes
any currently known post-AGB evolutionary models. Moreover, their carbon and
nitrogen abundances present us with further problems for their interpretation.
V348 Sgr and HV 2671 are in general agreement with a born-again post-AGB
evolution and their abundances are similar to Wolf-Rayet central stars of PN.
The three Galactic stars in the sample have circumstellar nebulae which produce
forbidden line radiation (for HV 2671 we have no information). V348 Sgr and DY
Cen have low density, low expansion velocity nebulae (resolved in the case of
V348 Sgr), while MV Sgr has a higher density, higher expansion velocity nebula.

Resolution Camera operating with tip-tilt adaptive optics correction.
Observations from the South African Astronomical Observatory in the V-band were
also analyzed and exhibit a periodic signal of the same period. This orbital
period suggests that V101 has a secondary of mid to late K spectral type with
Mv = +8.2 +- 0.5. The predicted spectral type is consistent with previous
spectral observations in quiescence which show a fairly red continuum. From the
observed minimum brightness of V = 22.5, we derive a distance modulus of (m -

useful probe of the density profile of clusters of galaxies. We examine several
systematic effects which are important in predicting the number of arcs, with
particular attention to the difference between tangential and radial arcs.
First we derive an analytic expression of the cross section for radial arcs
taking account of the source size and find that the moderate source size
enhances the cross section for radial arcs while larger source size (\gtrsim
1'' in our example) suppresses the number of radial arcs. On the other hand,
tangential arcs are much less sensitive to the source size. Next we numerically
calculate the cross section for arcs considering the lens and source
ellipticities. We find that the numbers of both tangential and radial arcs are
highly enhanced by both ellipticities, by one or two orders of magnitude. The
number ratio of radial to tangential arcs is, however, not so affected if the
threshold axis ratio of arcs is large (\gtrsim 7). The number ratio therefore
still remains good statistics which probe the density profile of the lens
objects, if the source size effect is correctly taken into account.

formed within growing cold dark matter halos. The outer RC shape correlates
mainly with the surface brightness (SB), the luminous mass fraction, fd, and
the bulge fraction. In order the shapes of RC depend significantly on
luminosity, fd should be a strong function of mass (feedback). For the
preferred values of fd (\lesssim 0.03), the high SB models can be maximum disks
only when the halos have a shallow core. The low SB models are sub-maximum
disks. The residuals of the baryonic Tully-Fisher (TF) and disk mass-radius
relations show a clear anti-correlation among them, but when one passes to the
TF and luminosity-radius relations, the anti-correlation almost disappears.
Therefore, the observed lack of correlation among the residuals of the last two
relations should not be interpreted as an evidence of sub-maximal disks.

above 165 K of the films with various thicknesses is consistent with small
polaronic hopping conductivity. The polaronic formation energy $E_{P}$ is
reduced with the decrease of film thickness. We found that the strain
dependence of $T_{c}$ mainly results from the strain-induced electron-phonon
coupling. The strain effect on $E_{P}$ is in good agreement with the

Below the Curie transition temperature $T_c=$ 125 K, $\rho_{ab}$ and $\rho_{c}$

the metallic regime (50 K $\leq T \leq$ 110 K), both $\rho_{ab}(T)$ and

$B_{ab}^{fit}$ and the ratio of the exchange interaction $J_{ab}/J_c$ obtained
by fitting the data are in excellent agreement with the calculated $B_{ab}$
based on the two-magnon model and $J_{ab}/J_c$ deduced from neutron scattering,
respectively. This provides further support for this scattering mechanism. At
even lower $T$, in the non-metallic regime ($T<$ 50 K), {\it both} the in-plane

virtual Dirac quasiparticle-hole excitation, is calculated carefully, and leads
to a ground state transition for the triangular lattice from an orientation
along one of the crystal axis to one at 45$^o$ to them, i.e, along the gap zero

  Electromagnetic Moments in pf-Shell Nuclei","11 pages, 4 figures",,,,"nucl-th cond-mat nlin.CD",,"  We study the fluctuation properties of $\Delta T=0$ electromagnetic
transition intensities and electromagnetic moments in $A \sim 60$ nuclei within
the framework of the interacting shell model, using a realistic effective
interaction for
  $pf$-shell nuclei with a $^{56}$Ni core. The distributions of the transition
intensities and of the electromagnetic moments are well described by the
Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. In particular, the transition
intensity distributions follow a Porter-Thomas distribution. When diagonal
matrix elements (i.e., moments) are included in the analysis of transition
intensities, we find that the distributions remain Porter-Thomas except for the
isoscalar $M1$. The latter deviation is explained in terms of the structure of
the isoscalar $M1$ operator.

  Generation","21 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.optics",,"  Polarized and azimuthal dependencies of optical second harmonics generation
(SHG) at the surface of noncentrosymmetric semiconductor crystals have been
measured on polished surfaces of ZnSe(100), using a fundamental wavelength of
1.06$\mu m$. The SHG intensity patterns were analyzed for all four combination
of p- and s-polarized incidence and output, considering both the bulk and
surface optical nonlinearities in the electric dipole approximation. We found
that the measurement using $S_{in}-S_{out}$ is particularly useful in
determining the symmetry of the oxdized layer interface, which would lower the
effective symmetry of the surface from $C_{4v}$ to $C_{2v}.$ We also have shown
that the [011] and [0$\bar{1}$1] directions can be distinguished through the
analysis of p-incident and p-output confugration.

Conversion is really an amplification, in a nonlinear crystal pumped by a
laser, of certain pairs of modes of the electromagnetic zeropoint field. The
demonstration is achieved by showing the existence of a related phenomenon,
Spontaneous Parametric Up Conversion. This phenomenon, once observed, will cast
doubt on the quantum-optical theory, which treats photons as the elementary
objects of the light field. It will also lend greater credibility to the
zeropoint-field description of optical entanglement phenomena. That description
is based on the unquantized light field and is consistently local, in contrast
with the nonlocal description of Quantum Optics.
