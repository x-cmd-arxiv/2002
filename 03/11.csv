Tunguska event. It is the only known example of a low altitude atmospheric
explosion. It is also the largest recorded event. Remarkably no fragments or
significant chemical traces have ever been recovered. (b) Anomalous low
altitude fireballs which (in some cases) have been observed to hit the ground.
The absence of fragments is particularly striking in these cases, but this is
not the only reason they are anomalous. On the other hand, there is strong
evidence that most of our galaxy is made from exotic dark material - `dark
matter'. Mirror matter is one well motivated dark matter candidate, since it is
dark and stable and it is required to exist if particle interactions are mirror
symmetric. If mirror matter is the dark matter, then some amount must exist in
our solar system. We demonstrate that the mirror matter theory allows for a
simple explanation for the puzzling meteoritic events [both (a) and (b)] if
they are due to mirror matter space-bodies. A direct consequence of this
explanation is that mirror matter fragments should exist in (or on) the ground
at various impact sites. The properties of this potentially recoverable
material depend importantly on the sign of the photon-mirror photon kinetic
mixing parameter, $\epsilon$. We argue that the broad characteristics of the
anomalous events suggests that $\epsilon$ is probably negative. Strategies for
detecting mirror matter in the ground are discussed.

that $\ell_{peak}$ is approximately a function of $\Omega_K/\Omega_M$ where
$\Omega_K$ and $\Omega_M$ are the curvature ($\Omega_K > 0$ implies an open

$\Omega_K/\Omega_M \ll 1$, one obtains a simple formula for $\ell_{peak}$, the

much higher column densities of ZnII. The gap between the QSO-DLA and GRB-DLA
distributions is smoothly bridged by observations of the interstellar
absorption in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. Very small [Fe/Zn],
[Si/Zn], and [Cr/Zn] values in GRB-DLAs indicate large dust depletions. Once
the dust-to-metals ratios are determined, we find an optical extinction A_V ~ 1
mags, to be compared with typical A_V < 0.1 in most QSO-DLAs. Our inference of
high dust content appears to be in contradiction with the typical low reddening
previously found in GRBs. One possible way to reconcile is a dust grain-size
distribution biased towards big grains, which would give a grey extinction.
Possibly the small dust grains have been destroyed by the GRBs themselves. Our
findings support the idea that primarily optically selected QSOs probe mainly
low gas/dust regions of high redshift galaxies, while the more powerful GRBs
can be detected through denser regions of their ISM (molecular clouds and star
forming regions). Therefore GRB-DLAs and QSO-DLAs together provide a more

undergone some Li depletion, our finding is indicative of shallow mixing, i.e.
of a mixing process that can transport surface material deep enough for Li
burning to occur, but not deep enough for Be burning. As shown in previous
studies, the Li vs. Be diagram is a powerful diagnostic of stellar interiors.

the current discrepancy in empirical distance estimates for 47 Tuc, arising
from recent MS-fitting and white dwarf fitting results, is due to inaccuracies

revealed systematic offsets which mean that the $(B-V)$ main-line used in
previous studies may be too blue by ~ 0.02 mag. We have derived main-lines in
V/(B-V) and V/(V-I) from the data of Kaluzny et al. (1998), which we have
recalibrated from the `secondary' standards in 47 Tuc of Stetson (2000). Using
an assumed cluster reddening of E(B-V)=0.04, our best-fit apparent distance
modulus is (m-M)V=13.37 (+0.10)(-0.11) in both colour planes, which implies a
cluster age of 11.0 +/-1.4 Gyr and leads to a dereddened distance modulus of
(m-M)0=13.25 (+0.06)(-0.07). Comparison with previous work shows that our
apparent distance modulus is ~0.2 mag smaller than those derived in previous
MS-fitting studies. The difference is accounted for by our preferred cluster
reddening and the recalibration of the cluster photometry, which has made the
main-line redder by an average of 0.02 mag in (B-V). Independent support for
our MS-fitting distance comes from consideration of the Red Clump in the
cluster, from which we derive a dereddened distance modulus of (m-M)0=13.31

mass and central velocity dispersion suggests a possibility to estimate the
SMBH mass from the measured central velocity dispersion. However, for most AGNs
it is difficult to measure the central velocity dispersions of their host
galaxies directly. In this paper we adopt the fundamental plane for ellipticals
to estimate the central velocity dispersion and SMBH mass for a number of AGNs
with morphology parameters of their elliptical host galaxies obtained by the
HST imaging observations. The estimated SMBH masses of 63 BL Lac objects, 10
radio galaxies, 10 radio-loud quasars and 9 radio-quiet quasars are mostly in
the range of $10^{7.5} M_\odot$ to $10^{9} M_\odot$. No significant difference
in black hole mass is found for high-frequency peaked BL Lacs and low-frequency
peaked BL Lacs, as well as for radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars. The
Eddington ratios of radio galaxies are substantially smaller than those of
quasars. This suggests that the different observational features of radio-loud
AGNs may be mainly dominated by accretion rate rather than by the black hole
mass, which is in agreement with some evolutionary scenarios recently proposed
for radio-loud AGNs. Different from some previous claims, we found that the
derived mean SMBH mass for radio-loud quasars is only slightly larger than that
of radio-quiet quasars. Though their SMBH mass distributions are statistically
different, their Eddington ratio distributions are probably from the same
population. In addition, we noted that the relation between black hole mass and
host galaxy luminosity obtained using the fundamental plane provides further
arguments for a nonlinear scaling law between SMBH and galactic bulge mass.

down to about 5 T at 0.5 K, where the flux flow resistivity becomes as small as
about 30 % of the normal state value. Below the upper critical field $H_{\rm

appears, as well as that of the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations, with
respect to the normal state one which is described with the standard
Lifshitz-Kosevich formula. The magnitude of the additional damping near $H_{\rm
c2}$ is the same with that observed in the dHvA oscillations and well explained
by the theoretical predictions in consideration of fluctuations in the thermal
vortex liquid state. In the quantum fluctuation region at lower temperature,
however, only SdH effect shows the stronger damping than that of the dHvA
oscillations. The different magnetic field dependence of the additional damping
of the oscillation amplitude between the SdH and dHvA effects is discussed in

  Institute on Elementary Particle Physics",,,"ULB-TH/02-08","hep-th",,"  The physical world is marked by the phenomenon of spontaneous broken symmetry
(SBS) i.e. where the state of a system is assymmetric with respect to the
symmetry principles that govern its dynamics. For material systems this is not
surprising since more often than not energetic considerations dictate that the
ground state or low lying excited states of many body system become ordered
i.e. a collective variable, such as magnetization or the Fourier transform of
the density of a solid, picks up expectation values which otherwise would
vanish by virtue of the dynamical symmetry(isotropy or translational symmetry
in the aforementioned examples). More surprising was the discovery of the role
of SBS in describing the vacuum or low lyng excitations of a quantum field
theory. First came spontaneously broken chiral symmetry which was then applied
to soft pion physics. When combined with current algebra, this field dominated
particle physics in the 60's. Then came the application of the notion of SBS to
situations where the symmetry is locally implemented by gauge fields. In that
case the concept of order becomes more subtle. This development lead the way to
electroweak unification and it remains one of the principal tools of the
theorist in the quest for physics beyond the standard model. This brief review
is intended to span the history of SBS with emphasis on conceptual rather than
quantitative content. It is a written version of lectures of R.Brout on the
``Paleolithic Age'' and on ``Modern Times'' by F.Englert, i.e. respectively

analytic surgery of eta- and rho-invariants. We investigate in detail the
(Atiyah-Patodi-Singer)-rho-invariant for manifolds with boundary. First we
generalize the cut-and-paste formula to arbitrary boundary conditions. A priori
the rho-invariant is an invariant of the Riemannian structure and a
representation of the fundamental group. We show, however, that the dependence
on the metric is only very mild: it is independent of the metric in the
interior and the dependence on the metric on the boundary is only up to its
pseudo--isotopy class. Furthermore, we show that this cannot be improved: we
give explicit examples and a theoretical argument that different metrics on the
boundary in general give rise to different rho-invariants. Theoretically, this
follows from an interpretation of the exponentiated rho-invariant as a
covariantly constant section of a determinant bundle over a certain moduli
space of flat connections and Riemannian metrics on the boundary. Finally we
extend to manifolds with boundary the results of Farber-Levine-Weinberger
concerning the homotopy invariance of the rho-invariant and spectral flow of
the odd signature operator.
