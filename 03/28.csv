Nebula (torus + jets) in terms of the standard theory by Kennel and Coroniti
(1984). The only new element is the inclusion of anisotropy in the energy flux
from the pulsar in the theory. In the standard theory of relativistic winds,
the Lorentz factor of the particles in front of the shock that terminates the
pulsar relativistic wind depends on the polar angle as
$\gamma=\gamma_0+\gamma_m\sin^2\theta$, where $\gamma_0 \sim 200$ and $\gamma_m
\sim 4.5\times 10^6$. The plasma flow in the wind is isotropic. After the
passage of the pulsar wind through the shock, the flow becomes subsonic with a
roughly constant (over the plerion volume) pressure $P={1\over 3}n\epsilon$,
where $n$ is the plasma particle density and $\epsilon$ is the mean particle
energy. Since $\epsilon \sim \gamma mc^2$, a low-density region filled with the
most energetic electrons is formed near the equator. A bright torus of
synchrotron radiation develops here. Jet-like regions are formed along the
pulsar rotation axis, where the particle density is almost four orders of
magnitude higher than that in the equatorial plane, because the particle energy
there is four orders of magnitude lower. The energy of these particles is too
low to produce detectable synchrotron radiation. However, these quasi-jets
become comparable in brightness to the torus if additional particle
acceleration takes place in the plerion. We also present the results of our
study of the hydrodynamic interaction between an anisotropic wind and the
interstellar medium. We compare the calculated and observed distributions of
the volume intensity of X-ray radiation.

well suited to detect and extract sources with a given profile embedded in a

useful to obtain a real-time preliminary catalogue of extragalactic sources,
which would have a great scientific interest, e. g. for follow-up observations.

role of solar variability in forcing terrestrial climate change on solar cycle
timescales (roughly 11 years). We examine the connection between mean annual
solar irradiance, as reconstructed from sunspot and isotope records, and the
climate, as proxied by two Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature
reconstructions. By applying wavelet transforms to these signals, we are able
to analyze both the frequency content of each signal, and also the time
dependence of that content. After computing wavelet transforms of the data, we
perform correlation analyses on the wavelet transforms of irradiance and
temperature via two techniques: the Pearson's method and the conditional
probability method. We thus track the correlation between individual frequency
components of both signals as a function of time. A nonzero correlation between
the irradiance and temperature wavelet spectra requires a phase lag between the
two data sets (i.e., terrestrial response to solar output is not
instantaneous). We search for the optimal phase lag that maximizes the
correlation. By choosing an appropriate phase for each year, we find a
significant, positive sun-climate correlation for most of the period AD
1720-1950. We find that this phase-optimized correlation varies in time,
oscillating between 0.12 and 0.71 throughout the past 400 years. We find that

present epoch and compare its predictions with observational data. We explore
two processes that break the self-similarity of galaxy clusters: systematic
variation in the dark matter halo concentration and energy injection into the
intracluster gas, through their effects on the observed cluster properties.
Three observed relations between cluster properties and temperature are
employed to constrain the model; mass, slope of gas density profile (beta) and
luminosity. The slope of the mass-temperature relation is found to be
reproduced by our model when the observed variation in concentration is
included, raising the slope from the self-similar prediction of 1.5, to that of
the observed relation, ~ 2. Heating of the gas is observed to have little
effect on the mass-temperature relation. The mean trend in the beta-temperature
relation is reproduced by energy injection of 0.5-0.75 keV per particle, while
concentration variation has only a small effect. Excess energies calculated for
individual systems from the beta-temperature relation suggest that the lowest
mass systems may have excess energies that are biased to lower values by
selection effects. The observed properties of the luminosity-temperature
relation are reproduced by the combined effects of excess energy and a trend in
the dark matter concentration. At high masses the observed variation in dark
matter concentration results a slope of ~ 2.7 compared to recent observations
in the range 2.6-2.9, whilst the observed steepening in galaxy groups is
predicted when heating of 0.5-0.75 keV per particle is included. Hence a
combination of energy injection and dark matter concentration variation appears
able to account for the mean trends in the observed relations.

of average values of quantum operators and time correlation functions in the

Initial conditions for this equation are given by the Fourier transform of the
Wiener path integral representation of the matrix elements of the propagators

Monte Carlo methods and computes numerical traces and spectra of the relevant
dynamical quantities such as momentum-momentum correlation functions and

  the 42th IEEE Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, FOCS 2001",,,,"cs.NI cs.DC",,"  We study {\em routing} and {\em scheduling} in packet-switched networks. We
assume an adversary that controls the injection time, source, and destination
for each packet injected. A set of paths for these packets is {\em admissible}
if no link in the network is overloaded. We present the first on-line routing
algorithm that finds a set of admissible paths whenever this is feasible. Our
algorithm calculates a path for each packet as soon as it is injected at its
source using a simple shortest path computation. The length of a link reflects
its current congestion. We also show how our algorithm can be implemented under
today's Internet routing paradigms.
  When the paths are known (either given by the adversary or computed as above)
our goal is to schedule the packets along the given paths so that the packets
experience small end-to-end delays. The best previous delay bounds for
deterministic and distributed scheduling protocols were exponential in the path
length. In this paper we present the first deterministic and distributed
scheduling protocol that guarantees a polynomial end-to-end delay for every
packet.
  Finally, we discuss the effects of combining routing with scheduling. We
first show that some unstable scheduling protocols remain unstable no matter
how the paths are chosen. However, the freedom to choose paths can make a
difference. For example, we show that a ring with parallel links is stable for
all greedy scheduling protocols if paths are chosen intelligently, whereas this
is not the case if the adversary specifies the paths.

the operational grounds the fields and spacetime are not very different. To
describe a field in an experimental region we have to assign coordinates to the
points of that region in order to speak of the ""when"" and ""where"" of the field
itself. But to operationally study the topology and to coordinatize the region
of spacetime, the use of radars (to send and receive electromagnetic signals)
is required. Thus the description of fields (or, rather, processes) and the
description of space-time are indistinguishable at the fundamental level.
Moreover, classical general relativity already says -- albeit preserving the
fiber bundle structure -- that spacetime and matter are intimately related. All
this indicates that a new theory of elementary processes (out of which all the
usual processes of creation, annihilation and propagation, and consequently the
topology of spacetime itself would be constructed) has to be devised.

operators are equal to the masses of the classical point particles in dS_3 that
cause the conical defect. The quantum dimensions instead are shown to coincide
with the mass of the Kerr-dS_3 solution computed with the Brown-York stress
tensor. Therefore classical de Sitter gravity encodes the quantum properties of
Liouville theory. The equality of the gravitational and the Liouville stress
tensor provides a further check of this correspondence. The Seiberg bound for
vertex operators translates on the bulk side into an upper mass bound for
classical point particles. Bulk solutions with cosmological event horizons
correspond to microscopic Liouville states, whereas those without horizons
correspond to macroscopic (normalizable) states. We also comment on recent
criticism by Dyson, Lindesay and Susskind, and point out that the
contradictions found by these authors may be resolved if the dual CFT is not
able to capture the thermal nature of de Sitter space. Indeed we find that on
the CFT side, de Sitter entropy is merely Liouville momentum, and thus has no
statistical interpretation in this approach.

soliton in ac-driven weakly damped systems with periodic boundary conditions.
The effect is demonstrated in detail for a long annular Josephson junction.
Unlike earlier considered cases of the ac-driven motion of fluxons (kinks), in
the present case the long junction is_spatially uniform_. Numerical simulations
reveal that progressive motion of the fluxon commences if the amplitude of the
ac drive exceeds a threshold value. The direction of the motion is randomly
selected by initial conditions, and a strong hysteresis is observed. An
analytical approach to the problem is based on consideration of the interaction
between plasma waves emitted by the fluxon under the action of the ac drive and
the fluxon itself, after the waves complete round trip in the annular junction.
The analysis predicts instability of the zero-average-velocity state of the
fluxon interacting with its own radiation tails, provided that the drive's
amplitude exceeds an explicitly found threshold. The predicted threshold
amplitude strongly depends on the phase shift gained by the wave after the
round trip. A very similar dependence is found in the simulations, testifying
to the relevance of the analytical consideration.

  Summary. In default of prior probability the parameter is not defined as a
random variable, hence there can be no genuine prior-free parametric inference.
Nevertheless prior-free predictive inference regarding any future datum is
generated directly from the datum of a location measurement. Such inference
turns out as if obtained from a certain pdf (""fiducial"") indirectly associated
with the parameter. This false pdf can expedite predictive inference, but is
inappropriate in the analysis of combined measurements (unless they all are
location measurements of the same parameter). Also it has the same distribution
as the ostensible Bayesian posterior from a uniform ""prior"". However, if any of
these spurious entities is admitted in the analysis, inconsistent results
follow. When we combine measurements, we find that the quantisation errors,
inevitable in data recording, must be taken into consideration. These errors
cannot be folded into predictive inference in an exact sense; that is, we
cannot render a predictive distribution of a future datum except as an
approximation.

at finite temperature. A leaky cavity is designed via the insertion of a
dispersive mirror into a larger ideal cavity (the reservoir). In the case of
parametric resonance the rotating wave approximation allows for the
construction of an effective Hamiltonian. The number of produced particles is
then calculated using response theory as well as a non-perturbative approach.
In addition we study the associated master equation and briefly discuss the
effects of detuning. The exponential growth of the particle numbers and the
strong enhancement at finite temperatures found earlier for ideal cavities turn
out to be essentially preserved. The relevance of the results for experimental
tests of quantum radiation via the dynamical Casimir effect is addressed.
Furthermore the generalization to the electromagnetic field is outlined.
