Second, we examine the probability that giant planets between 1 and 3 M_J could

the Sun, finding that heated giant planets would be efficiently destroyed near
the surface of the star, while the cores of cold giant planets may be able to
survive to the base of the star's convection zone. Third, we examine the tidal
interaction between a planet and its host star, showing that this interaction
can lead to tidal disruption of the planet and accretion of its material, or
orbital decay followed by hydrodynamical interaction. Throughout, we consider
the case of HD 82943, a star known to have two planets and having a preliminary
detection of 6Li. Using stellar models including diffusion, we estimate the
mass of the HD 82943 to be about 1.2 M_sun and its age to be about 0.5-1.5 Gyr.
The observed 7Li abundance for HD 82943 is consistent with stars of similar

  Journal","Astrophys.J.584:541-558,2003","10.1086/345788",,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate the evolution of substructure in cold dark matter halos using
N-body simulations of tidal stripping of substructure halos (subhalos) within a
static host potential. We find that halos modeled following the Navarro, Frenk
& White (NFW) mass profile lose mass continuously due to tides from the massive
host, leading to the total disruption of satellite halos with small tidal
radii. The structure of stripped NFW halos depends mainly on the fraction of
mass lost, and can be expressed in terms of a simple correction to the original
NFW profile. We apply these results to substructure in the Milky Way, and
conclude that the dark matter halos surrounding its dwarf spheroidal (dSph)
satellites have circular velocity curves that peak well beyond the luminous
radius at velocities significantly higher than expected from the stellar
velocity dispersion. Our modeling suggests that the true tidal radii of dSphs
lie well beyond the putative tidal cutoff observed in the surface brightness
profile, suggesting that the latter are not really tidal in origin but rather
features in the light profile of limited dynamical relevance. For Draco, in
particular, our modeling implies that its tidal radius is much larger than
derived by Irwin & Hatzidimitriou (1995), lending support to the interpretation
of recent Sloan survey data by Odenkirchen et al. (2001). Similarly, our model
suggests that Carina's halo has a peak circular velocity of ~55 km/s, which may
help explain how this small galaxy has managed to retain enough gas to undergo
several bursts of star formation. Our results imply a close correspondence
between the most massive subhalos expected in a CDM universe and the known
satellites of the Milky Way, and suggest that only subhalos with peak circular
velocities below 35 km/s lack readily detectable luminous counterparts.

band range from 4e39 ergs/s to 5e41 ergs/s, which are 1-3 orders of magnitude
smaller than in classical Seyfert galaxies. The X-ray spectra of most objects
are well described by a canonical model which consists of (1) a soft component
from a thermal plasma with kT<1 keV and (2) a hard component represented by a
power law with a photon index~1.8 or thermal bremsstrahlung emission with kT~10
keV. Several objects do not require the soft thermal component, and their
continua are well fitted by a single power-law model. Some objects show heavy
absorption with column densities in excess of 1e23 cm^-2. We detect in several
objects Fe K line emission with equivalent widths ranging from 50 eV to 2 keV.
Variability on timescales less than a day is uncommon in our sample. By
comparing multiple observations made with ASCA or with published observations

we take a different viewpoint and would like to view dark matter as an emergent
phenomenon - very much like many such phenomena known in condensed matter

that an intrinsic bend in the jet is undetected in one image and magnified in

The known populations of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters are far too small

dark objects is needed. The standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model might be able

efficient conversion of shock ram pressure into cosmic-ray pressure.
Cosmic-rays accelerated at these shocks produce a diffuse gamma-ray flux which
is dominated by inverse Compton emission from electrons scattering off cosmic
microwave background photons. Decay of neutral pi-mesons generated in p-p
inelastic collisions of the ionic cosmic-ray component with the thermal gas
contribute about 30% of the computed emission. Based on experimental upper
limits on the photon flux above 100 MeV from nearby clusters we constrain the

thermal cloud at finite temperature T. The finite system size allows three
different regimes for the equilibrium density profiles at T=0: a fully mixed
state, a partially mixed state in which the overlap between the boson and
fermion clouds is decreasing, and a fully demixed state where the two clouds
have zero overlap. We propose simple analytical rules for the two cross-overs

several exotic configurations for the two phase-separated clouds in addition to
simple ones consisting of a core of bosons enveloped by fermions and ""vice

simply exacerbates or transfers the problem.
  Because the entropy of de Sitter space is $S\leq 1/\Lambda$, using the
present acceleration of the universe as a low energy $(\Lambda\sim 10^{-120}$)
inflationary stage, as in cyclic ekpyrotic models, produces a gravitational
heat death after one cycle. Only higher energy driven inflation, together with
a suitable, quantum gravity holography style, restriction on {\em ab initio}
degrees of freedom, gives a suitable low entropy initial state. We question the
suggestion that a high energy inflationary stage could be naturally reentered
by Poincare recurrence within a finite causal region of an accelerating
universe.

consistent with the 2nd law of thermodynamics within a causal patch.

due to its relation to the so called {\it Proton Spin Problem}. The relevant
flavor singlet axial current is anomalous, i.e., its divergence contains a
piece which is the celebrated $U_A(1)$ anomaly. This anomaly is intimately
associated with the $\eta^\prime$ meson, which gets its mass from it. When the
gauge degrees of freedom of QCD are confined within a volume as is presently
understood, the $U_A(1)$ anomaly is known to induce color anomaly leading to
""leakage"" of the color out of the confined volume (or bag). For consistency of
the theory, this anomaly should be cancelled by a boundary term. This ``color
boundary term"" inherits part or most of the dynamics of the volume (i.e., QCD).
In this thesis, we exploit this mapping of the volume to the surface via the
color boundary condition to perform a complete analysis of the flavor singlet
axial charge in the chiral bag model using the Cheshire Cat Principle. This
enables us to obtain the hitherto missing piece in the axial charge associated
with the gluon Casimir effect. The result is that the flavor singlet axial
charge is small independent of the confinement (bag) size ranging from the
skyrmion picture to the MIT bag picture, thereby confirming the (albeit
approximate) Cheshire Cat phenomenon.

how heat-kernel methods can be used to obtain approximate solutions to the flow
and the corresponding Ward identities. Expansion schemes are discussed, which
are not applicable in covariant gauges. As an application, we derive the
one-loop effective action for covariantly constant field strength, and the
one-loop beta-function for arbitrary regulator.

symmetric scalar field theories are studied to leading order in the derivative
expansion. The Gaussian fixed point is examined for d>2 dimensions and
arbitrary infrared regularisation. The Wilson-Fisher fixed point in d=3 is
studied using an optimised flow. We compute critical exponents and subleading
corrections-to-scaling to high accuracy from the eigenvalues of the stability
matrix at criticality for all N. We establish that the optimisation is
responsible for the rapid convergence of the flow and polynomial truncations
thereof. The scheme dependence of the leading critical exponent is analysed.
For all N > 0, it is found that the leading exponent is bounded. The upper
boundary is achieved for a Callan-Symanzik flow and corresponds, for all N, to
the large-N limit. The lower boundary is achieved by the optimised flow and is
closest to the physical value. We show the reliability of polynomial
approximations, even to low orders, if they are accompanied by an appropriate
choice for the regulator. Possible applications to other theories are outlined.

in the absence of external turbulence the intermediate region between the
viscous sublayer and the external flow consists of two sharply separated
self-similar structures. The velocity distribution in these structures is
described by two different scaling laws. The mean velocity u in the region
adjacent to the viscous sublayer is described by the previously obtained
Reynolds-number-dependent scaling law $\phi = u/u_*=A\eta^{\alpha}$,
$A=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \ln Re_{\Lambda}+ \frac 52$, $\alpha=\frac{3}{2\ln
Re_{\Lambda}}$,
  $\eta = u_* y/\nu$. (Here $u_*$ is the dynamic or friction velocity, y is the
distance from the wall, $\nu$ the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, and the
Reynolds number $Re_{\Lambda}$ is well defined by the data) In the region
adjacent to the external flow the scaling law is different: $\phi=
B\eta^{\beta}$. The power $\beta$ for zero-pressure-gradient boundary layers
was found by processing various experimental data and is close (with some
scatter) to 0.2. We show here that for non-zero-pressure-gradient boundary
layers, the power $\beta$ is larger than 0.2 in the case of adverse pressure
gradient and less than 0.2 for favourable pressure gradient. Similarity
analysis suggests that both the coefficient B and the power $\beta$ depend on
$Re_{\Lambda}$ and on a new dimensionless parameter P proportional to the
pressure gradient. Recent experimental data of Perry, Maru\v{s}i\'c and Jones
(1)-(4) were analyzed and the results are in agreement with the model we
propose.

  and time delay patterns","6 pages, including 6 figures, RevTeX",,,,"nlin.CD cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  We propose a simple method to measure synchronization and time delay patterns
between signals. It is based on the relative timings of events in the time
series, defined e.g. as local maxima. The degree of synchronization is obtained
from the number of quasi-simultaneous appearances of events, and the delay is
calculated from the precedence of events in one signal with respect to the
other. Moreover, we can easily visualize the time evolution of the delay and
synchronization level with an excellent resolution.
  We apply the algorithm to short rat EEG signals, some of them containing
spikes. We also apply it to an intracranial human EEG recording containing an
epileptic seizure, and we propose that the method might be useful for the
detection of foci and for seizure prediction. It can be easily extended to
other types of data and it is very simple and fast, thus being suitable for
on-line implementations.

  Nuclear Physics, Bormio (Italy), January 21-25 2002",,,"GANIL P 02 07","nucl-ex",,"  Fragment production in central collisions of Xe+Sn has been systematically
studied with the INDRA multidetector from 25 to 150 AMeV. The predominant role
of collision dynamics is evidenced in multiple intermediate mass fragment
production even at the lowest energies, around the so-called
""multifragmentation threshold"". For beam energies 50 AMeV and above, a
promising agreement with suitably modified Antisymmetrised Molecular Dynamics
calculations has been achieved. Intriguingly the same reactions have recently
been interpreted as evidence for a liquid-gas phase transition in
thermodynamically equilibrated systems. The universal fluctuation theory,
thanks to its lack of any equilibrium hypothesis, shows clearly that in all but
a tiny minority of carefully-selected central collisions fragment production is
incompatible with either critical or phase coexistence behaviour. On the other
hand, it does not exclude some similarity with aggregation scenarios such as
the lattice-gas or Fisher droplet models.

relativistic heavy ion collisions from both superposition of initial multiple
proton-proton interactions and the secondary collisions in the produced
hadronic matter. The yield of phi mesons is then reconstructed from their
decaying product of either the kaon-antikaon pairs or the dimuon pairs. Since
the kaon-antikaon pairs at midrapidity with low transverse momenta are
predominantly rescattered or absorbed in the hadronic medium, they can not be
used to reconstruct the phi meson and lead thus to a smaller reconstructed phi
meson yield than that reconstructed from the dimuon channel. With in-medium
mass modifications of kaons and phi mesons, the phi yield from dimuons is
further enhanced compared to that from the kaon-antikaon pairs. The model
result is compared with the experimental data at the CERN/SPS and RHIC energies
and its implications to quark-gluon plasma formation are discussed.

  paper with Charis Anastopoulos",,"10.1016/S0960-0779(02)00299-0","umdpp 02-038","quant-ph",,"  In quantum computation, it is of paramount importance to locate the parameter
space where maximal coherence can be preserved in the qubit system. In recent
years environment-induced decoherence based the quantum Brownian motion (QBM)
models have been applied to two level systems (2LS) interacting with an
electromagnetic field, leading to the general belief that 2LS are easily
decohered. In a recent paper C. Anastopoulos and B. L. Hu [Phys. Rev. A62,
(2000) 033821] derived a new exact non-Markovian master equation at zero
temperature, from which they showed that this belief is actually misplaced. For
a two-level atom (2LA)- electromagnetic field (EMF) system the decoherence time
is rather long, comparable to the relaxation time. Theoretically this is
because the dominant interaction is the $\hat \sigma_{\pm}$ type of coupling
between the two levels (what constitutes the qubit) and the field, not the
$\hat \sigma_z$ type, which shows the QBM behavior. Depending on the coupling
the field can act as a resonator (in an atom cavity) or as a bath (in QBM) and
produce very different decoherent behavior in the system. This is not new to
Cavity QED experimentalists: the 2LA-EMF system maintaining its coherence in
sufficiently long duration is the reason why they can manipulate them so well
to show interesting quantum coherence effects.
