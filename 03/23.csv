up in the H I line profiles as extended wings of emission towards the systemic
velocity. In the central regions these wings are very broad (up to 150 km/s)
and indicate large deviations from circular motion. We have separated the
anomalous gas component from the cold disk and have obtained for it a separate
velocity field and a separate rotation curve. The mass of the anomalous
component is 1/10 of the total H I mass. The rotation velocity of the anomalous
gas is 25-50 km/s lower than that of the disk. Its velocity field has
non-orthogonal major and minor axes that we interpret as due to an overall
inflow motion of 10-20 km/s towards the centre of the galaxy. The picture
emerging from these observations is that of a cold H I disk surrounded by a
thick and clumpy H I layer characterized by slower rotation and inflow motion
towards the center. The origin of this anomalous gas layer is unclear. It is
likely, however, that it is related to the high rate of star formation in the
disk of NGC 2403 and that its kinematics is the result of a galactic fountain
type of mechanism. We suggest that these anomalous H I complexes may be
analogous to a part of the High Velocity Clouds of our Galaxy.

cooling (mass dropout) is assumed to avoid accumulation of unacceptably large

evidence for locally cooling gas. This has revived the notion that cooling
flows are heated by some process such as an intermittent, low-level AGN
involving supermassive black holes in the central galaxy. To explore this
hypothesis, we consider the gasdynamical consequences of galactic cooling flows
heated by many different scenarios without specifying the detailed physics of
the heating process. We are unable to find a single acceptable heated flow in
reasonable agreement with well observed hot gas temperature and density
profiles, even using finely tuned parameters. Idealized flows in which
radiative cooling is perfectly balanced by global heating are grossly
incompatible with observations. Flows heated by episodic central feedback
generate quasi-cyclic changes in the hot gas density profile which are not
supported by current observations. Paradoxically, centrally heated (or
pressurized) cooling flows experience spontaneous non-linear compressions that
result in spatially widespread cooling instabilities. Therefore, spectral
evidence for cooling gas is difficult to avoid by central heating.

Taken at face value, this dispersion implies a mass-to-light ratio of ~ 40 (in
solar units) based on the best-fit King-Michie model. The surface density
profile of Palomar 13 also appears to be anomalous among Galactic globular
clusters -- depending upon the details of background subtraction and
model-fitting, Palomar 13 either contains a substantial population of
""extra-tidal"" stars, or it is far more spatially extended than previously
suspected. The full surface density profile is equally well-fit by a
King-Michie model having a high concentration and large tidal radius, or by a
NFW model. We examine -- and tentatively reject -- a number of possible
explanations for the observed characteristics of Palomar 13 (e.g., velocity
""jitter"" among the red giants, spectroscopic binary stars, non-standard mass
functions, modified Newtonian dynamics), and conclude that the two most
plausible scenarios are either catastrophic heating during a recent
perigalacticon passage, or the presence of a massive dark halo. Thus, the
available evidence suggests that Palomar 13 is either a globular cluster which

observations is a bar-shaped ""filament"" inclined almost at right angles to the
inferred jet direction and extending 24"" (10.8 /h kpc) along its longest axis.
The constraints of reproducing the appearance of this structure in simulations
indicate that the jet of Pictor A lies nearly in the plane of the sky. The
results of the simulation are also consistent with other features found in the
radio image of Pictor A. This filament arises from the surging behaviour of the
jet near the hot-spot; the surging is provoked by alternate compression and
decompression of the jet by the turbulent backflow in the cocoon. We also
examine the arguments for the jet in Pictor A being at a more acute angle to
the line of sight and find that our preferred orientation is just consistent
with the limits on the brightness ratio of the X-ray jet and counter-jet. We
determine from our simulations, the structure function of hot-spot brightness

which is encountered whenever Standard Model is incorporated into a theory with
a larger mass scale. Experimentally, one of the first signals of physics beyond
Standard Model is provided by the atmospheric neutrino experiments which
indicate the existence of at least one non-zero neutrino mass. An
interpretation of both solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies in terms of
neutrino oscillations would lead to specific patterns for neutrino masses and
mixing. In this thesis, we studied the possibilities of generating the required
neutrino mass patterns in the context of supersymmetric standard models with
lepton number (L) violation. After an introduction to supersymmetric standard
models in Chapter 1, we give an overview of neutrino phenomenology in chapter
2. Chapter 3 discusses analytical and semi-analytical solutions to
Renormalisation Group Equations (RGE) with lepton number violating couplings in
the superpotential. Neutrino masses with bilinear L violation in the context of
gauge mediated supersymmetric models (GMSB) are discussed in Chapter 4, where
2-loop RGE for the parameter $\Delta B_i$ are presented. Chapter 5 discusses
neutrino mass structure when L violation is through trilinear lepton number
violating terms. Chapter 6 discusses RG enhancement of neutrino masses and
neutrino mass bounds on trilinear lepton number violating couplings in the
context of mSUGRA. Chapter 7 summarises general features of neutrino masses
within these models and contains overall conclusions based on the work
presented in the thesis.

tachyon, absence of the adequate Adler zero, and massless vector particles, not
to mention the conformal anomaly. The supersymmetric version does not really
solve most of these problems. For a long time it has been believed that the
solution of at least some of these difficulties is associated to a proper
identification of the vacuum, but this program has remained elusive. We show in
this work how the first three problems can be avoided, by using a sigma model
approach where excitations above the correct (chirally non-invariant) QCD
vacuum are identified. At the leading order in a derivative expansion we
recover the non-linear sigma model of pion interactions. At the next-to-leading
order the O(p^4) Lagrangian of Gasser and Leutwyler is obtained, with values

Hilbert space $X$ into $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ can be uniformly approximated by
$C^\infty$ smooth mappings {\em with no critical points}. This kind of result
can be regarded as a sort of very strong approximate version of the Morse-Sard
theorem. Some consequences of the main theorem are as follows. Every two
disjoint closed subsets of $X$ can be separated by a one-codimensional smooth
manifold which is a level set of a smooth function with no critical points;
this fact may be viewed as a nonlinear analogue of the geometrical version of
the Hahn-Banach theorem. In particular, every closed set in $X$ can be
uniformly approximated by open sets whose boundaries are $C^\infty$ smooth
one-codimensional submanifolds of $X$. Finally, since every Hilbert manifold is
diffeomorphic to an open subset of the Hilbert space, all of these results
still hold if one replaces the Hilbert space $X$ with any smooth manifold $M$
modelled on $X$.

exact result for maps of Bernoulli type since the work of Fujisaka and
Grossmann [Z. Physik B {\bf 48}, 261 (1982)]. However, this correct solution is

approaches, the bridges are being built between different ways of describing
the stable as well as the most exotic nuclei. In the present talk, I give a
review of several selected subjects that are currently at the fore front of new
developments in this domain of nuclear science.

(CP), intermediate mass fragments (IMF) and the largest fragment (MAX) are
investigated for $^{129}Xe$ as functions of temperature and 'freeze-out'
density in the frameworks of the isospin-dependent lattice gas model and the
classical molecular dynamics model. Definite turning points for the slopes of
average multiplicity of LP, CP and IMF, and of the mean mass of the largest
fragment ($A_{max}$) are shown around a liquid-gas phase transition temperature
and while the largest variances of the distributions of LP, CP, IMF and MAX
appear there. It indicates that the cluster emission rate can be taken as a
probe of nuclear liquid--gas phase transition. Furthermore, the largest
fluctuation is simultaneously accompanied at the point of the phase transition
as can be noted by investigating both the variances of their cluster
multiplicity or mass distributions and the Campi scatter plots within the
lattice gas model and the molecular dynamics model, which is consistent with
the result of the traditional thermodynamical theory when a phase transition
occurs.

isospin dependent lattice gas model and classical molecular dynamics model. It
is found that the emission of individual cluster which is heavier than proton
is almost Poissonian except near the liquid gas phase transition point and the
thermal scaling is observed by the linear Arrhenius plots which is made from
the average multiplicity of each cluster versus the inverse of temperature in
the nuclear liquid phase. It indicates of a statistical nature of such cluster
emission in the models. The ""emission barriers"" which are the slopes of the
Arrhenius plots are extracted as a function of the mass or charge number and
fitted by the formula embodied with the contributions of the surface energy and
Coulomb interaction. The possible influences of the source size, Coulomb
interaction and ""freeze-out"" density and related physical implications are
discussed.

  Primary: 35Q35, Secondary: 76B03,76B47","Comm Partial Differential Equations 28 (2003) 349-379",,,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  In this article we study the asymptotic behavior of incompressible, ideal,
time-dependent two dimensional flow in the exterior of a single smooth obstacle
when the size of the obstacle becomes very small. Our main purpose is to
identify the equation satisfied by the limit flow. We will see that the
asymptotic behavior depends on $\gamma$, the circulation around the obstacle.
For smooth flow around a single obstacle, $\gamma$ is a conserved quantity
which is determined by the initial data. We will show that if $\gamma = 0$, the
limit flow satisfies the standard incompressible Euler equations in the full
plane but, if $\gamma \neq 0$, the limit equation acquires an additional
forcing term. We treat this problem by first constructing a sequence of
approximate solutions to the incompressible 2D Euler equation in the full plane
from the exact solutions obtained when solving the equation on the exterior of
each obstacle and then passing to the limit on the weak formulation of the
equation. We use an explicit treatment of the Green's function of the exterior
domain based on conformal maps, {\it a priori} estimates obtained by carefully
examining the limiting process and the Div-Curl Lemma, together with a standard
weak convergence treatment of the nonlinearity for the passage to the limit.
