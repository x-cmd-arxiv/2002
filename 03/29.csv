examined with N-body simulations, and precise amplitudes of the Galactic warp
excitation are obtained. The Galactic models are constructed most realistically
to satisfy available observational constraints on the local circular velocity,
the mass, surface density and thickness of the disk, the mass and size of the
bulge, the local density of the halo matter at the solar radius, and the mass
and orbit of the LMC. By using hybrid algorithm (SCF-TREE) I have succeeded to
follow the evolution with millions of particles. The orbiting satellite excites
density enhancement as a wake, and the wake exerts a tidal force on the disk.
Because of the additional torque from the wakes in the halo, the amplitudes of
the induced warps are much larger than the classical estimate by [hunt1969],
who considered only the direct torque from the LMC. The obtained amplitudes of
m=0, 1, 2 warps in the larger halo model show very good agreement with the
observed amplitude in the Milky Way. This result revives the LMC as a possible
candidate of the origin of the Galactic warp. Our smaller halo model, however,
yield only weak warps in all the harmonic modes. Therefore the halo still has
significant influence on excitation of warp even in the interaction scenario
for excitation of warps.

connection between high-redshift quasars and their host galaxies. In the
framework of a model where the shining of the quasar is the episode that stops
the formation of the galactic spheroid inside a virialized halo, it has been
proven possible to explain the submillimetre source counts together with their
related statistics and the local luminosity function of spheroidal galaxies.
The time delay between the virialization and the quasar manifestation required
to fit the counts is short and incresing with decresing the host galaxy mass.
In this paper we compute the detailed chemical evolution of gas and stars
inside virialized haloes in the framework of the same model, taking into
account the combined effects of cooling and stellar feedback. Under the
assumption of negligible angular momentum, we are able to reproduce the main
observed chemical properties of local ellipticals. In particular, by using the
same duration of the bursts which are required in order to fit the
submillimetre source counts, we recover the observed increase of the Mg/Fe
ratio with galactic mass. Since for the most massive objects the assumed
duration of the burst is Tburst < 0.6 Gyr, we end up with a picture for
elliptical galaxy formation in which massive spheroids complete their assembly
at early times, thus resembling a monolithic collapse, whereas smaller galaxies
are allowed for a more prolonged star formation, thus allowing for a more
complicated evolutionary history.

been shown to correlate strongly (r=0.8) with a galaxy's central velocity

cost-effective (in terms of both telescope time and data reduction) for many
fields of extragalactic research. It is a purely photometric quantity which
apparently not only traces the mass of a bulge but has additionally been shown
to reflect the degree of bulge concentration. This paper explores the affect of
replacing the central velocity dispersion term in the Fundamental Plane with
the Sersic index n. Using a sample of early-type galaxies from the Virgo and
Fornax clusters, various (B-band) `Photometric Planes' were constructed and
found to have a scatter of 0.14-0.17 dex in log(r_e), or a distance error of
38-48% per galaxy (the higher values arising from the inclusion of the S0
galaxies). The corresponding Fundamental Plane yielded a 33-37% error in
distance for the same galaxy (sub-)samples (i.e. ~15-30% less scatter). The
gains in using a hyperplane (i.e. adding the Sersic index to the Fundamental
Plane as a fourth parameter) were small, giving a 27-33% error in distance,
depending on the galaxy sample used. The Photometric Plane has been used here
to estimate the Virgo-Fornax distance modulus; giving a value of
\Delta\mu=0.62(+/-0.30) mag (cf. 0.51(+/-0.21), HST Key Project on the
Extragalactic distance Scale). The prospects for using the Photometric Plane at
higher redshift appears promising. Using published data on the intermediate
redshift cluster Cl 1358+62 (z=0.33) gave a Photometric Plane distance error of
35-41% per galaxy.

angular momenta of many stars in a galaxy disk. Stars near to corotation are
affected most strongly: for a wave of ~20% overdensity, the rms change for
particles near to corotation is ~18% of their initial angular momenta. Yet
these changes produce no increase in random motion near corotation, while the
same wave causes mild heating near its Lindblad resonances. The direction of
radial migration depends both on initial location relative to corotation and on
azimuth. Streamlines of cold gas become very significantly distorted before
they cross, suggesting that gas is also mixed radially by this mechanism. Such
continuous churning of the disk has profound implications for abundance
gradients in galaxies. Furthermore, it is quite possible that the Sun has
migrated significantly from its radius of birth, consistent with the claims of
Wielen et al.

as many as 40%) are double-barred, with no preference for Hubble type or the
strength of the primary bar. A typical secondary bar is ~12% of the size of its
primary bar and 240--750 pc in radius. We see no significant effect of
secondary bars on nuclear activity. We also find kiloparsec-scale inner disks

are on average 20% the size of their host bar, and show a wider range of
relative sizes than do secondary bars. Nuclear rings are present in about a
third of our sample. Most are dusty, sites of current or recent star formation,

(15% of the S0's) appear to have purely stellar nuclear rings, with no evidence

spectroscopy were compared with temperatures estimated using optical and

significantly higher than the photometric estimates, possibly as a result of
spottedness or chromospheric activity on these active stars. Values of
effective temperature, surface gravity, and luminosity were compared to
theoretical stellar evolution tracks and the evolutionary status of these
objects was evaluated. The correlation between heavy element abundance patterns
and kinematics (space motion) was also examined. Two nearby stars that were
tentatively assigned to the Hyades cluster based on kinematics have Fe
abundances that are also consistent with membership in that cluster. Members of
the Ursa Major kinematic group exhibit a range of [Fe/H] values but have

incorporation of the heavy elements into protostars is creating the variation
in metallicity. Local Association members have a distinctly different Si/Fe

anti-phase to the HeI line, i.e., PG1115+166 is a DA+DB binary. The minimum
masses of the stars are M_DA=0.43+-0.15 solar masses and M_DB=0.52+-0.12 solar
masses. The separation of the stars is about 45 solar radii which is much
smaller than a typical AGB progenitor of a white dwarf, implying that there has
been at least one common envelope phase in this binary. Indeed, it is possible
that this binary may have suffered up to three mass transfer episodes - two
associated with the red giant phase prior to the formation of each white dwarf
and a third associated with the ``born-again'' red giant phase of the DB white
dwarf. PG1115+166 has the longest orbital period of any post common envelope
white dwarf - white dwarf binary found to date. Published models for the
formation of white dwarf - white dwarf binaries do not predict any white dwarfs
with the combination of long orbital period and high mass found in PG1115+166.
We conclude that PG1115+166 is a key object for testing models of binary star
evolution and it may also be a key object for our understanding of the
formation of DB white dwarfs. We outline the observational tests which can be
applied to scenarios for the formation of PG1115+166 and apply them to the
simplest case of a single common envelope phase. This suggests that some part
of the internal energy stored in the envelope of the AGB star, e.g., as ionized
hydrogen, may have contributed to the ejection of the common envelope, but
there are several unanswered questions concerning this simple scenario.

coefficient and ionic distribution functions from Poisson-Boltzmann theory with

results for the case of poly(para-phenylene) and compare it to recently
obtained experimental data on this stiff polyelectrolyte. We also investigate

should correspond to the "" geometrical optics "" limit of a linear wave
equation, in the same way as ray optics is the limit of wave optics. It is
shown that, using notions of modern wave theory, the "" geometrical optics ""
analogy leads to the correspondence between a classical Hamiltonian H and a ""
quantum "" wave equation in a natural and general way. In particular, the
correspondence is unambiguous also in the case where H contains mixed terms
involving momentum and position. In the line of Schroedinger's ideas, it is
also attempted to justify the occurrence, in QM, of eigenvalues problems, not
merely for energy, but also for momentum. It is shown that the wave functions
of pure momentum states can be defined in a physically more satisfying way than
by assuming plane waves. In the case of a spatially uniform force field, such
momentum states have a singularity and move undeformed according to Newton's
second law. The mentioned unambiguous correspondence allows to uniquely extend
the Klein-Gordon relativistic wave equation to the case where a constant
gravitational field is present. It is argued that Schroedinger's wave mechanics
can be extended to the case with a variable gravitational field only if one
accepts that the wave equation is a preferred-frame one. From this viewpoint,
generally-covariant extensions of the wave equations of QM seem rather formal.
Finally, it is conjectured that there is no need for a quantum gravity.

MSSM, taking into account the previously uncalculated contributions from
supersymmetric (SUSY) particles. We find that the contributions of the SUSY
particles enhance the cross section over most of SUSY parameter space,
especially when the SUSY particles are light, ~200 GeV. With favorable SUSY
parameters, at small tan beta, this process can yield more than ten
W^{\pm}H^{\mp} events for m_{H^{\pm}} <~ 350 GeV in 500 fb-1 at a 500 GeV e+e-
collider, or m_{H^{\pm}} <~ 600 GeV in 1000 fb-1 at a 1000 GeV collider. 80%
left-handed polarization of the e- beam improves these reaches to m_{H^{\pm}}
<~ 375 GeV and m_{H^{\pm}} <~ 670 GeV, respectively.

look like R^4/Z_2 fibered over a SLAG, and can globally be embedded in CICYs in
weighted projective spaces. The local model depends on the choice of a discrete
torsion in the fibration, and the global model on an anti-holomorphic
involution of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface. We determine how these choices are
related to each other by computing a Wilson surface detecting discrete torsion.

due to light scattering during the propagation along an optical transmission
line and propose a setup allowing an entanglement purification from a number of
preparations which are partially decohered due to transmission. A purification
is achieved even without any manual intervention. We consider a nondemolition
configuration to measure the purity of the state as contrast of interference
fringes in a double-slit setup. Regarding the entangled coherent states as a
state of a bipartite quantum system, a close relationship between purity and
entanglement of formation can be obtained. In this way, the contrast of
interference fringes provides a direct means to measure entanglement.

mirror, is studied within the framework of a one dimensional model with respect
to spontaneous decay and resonance fluorescence. The system under consideration
corresponds to the setup of a recently performed experiment [J. Eschner
\textit{et. al.}, Nature \textbf{413}, 495 (2001)] where the influence of a
mirror on a fluorescing single atom was revealed. In the present work special
attention is paid to a regime of large atom-mirror distances where intrinsic
memory effects cannot be neglected anymore. This is done with the help of delay
differential equations which contain, for small atom-mirror distances, the
Markovian limit with effective level shifts and decay rates leading to the
phenomenon of enhancement or inhibition of spontaneous decay. Several features
are recovered beyond an effective Markovian treatment, appearing in
experimental accessible quantities like intensity or emission spectra of the
scattered light.
