  6-8 February 2002",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The determination of chemical abundances in star-forming galaxies and the
study of their evolution on cosmological timescales are powerful tools for
understanding galaxy formation and evolution. This contribution presents the
latest results in this domain. We show that detailed studies of chemical
abundances in UV-selected, HII and starburst nucleus galaxies, together with
the development of new chemical evolution models, put strong constraints on the
evolutionary stage of these objects in terms of star formation history.
Finally, we summarize our current knowledge on the chemical properties of
distant galaxies. Although the samples are still too small for statistical
studies, these results give insight into the nature and evolution of distant
star-forming objects and their link with present-day galaxies. No doubt that
the next large-scale spectroscopic surveys on 10-m class telescopes will shed
light on these fundamental issues.

However, w_QG depends on several cosmological parameters and the galaxy bias

summarize the relative frequency of the energy of photons (X-ray or gamma-ray)
arriving at a detector. Independent Poisson distributions are more appropriate
to model the counts than the commonly used normal approximation. We model the
high energy tail of the ASCA spectrum of each of the stars as a combination of
a Bremsstrahlung continuum and ten narrow emission lines, included at positions
of known strong lines. Statistical analysis is based on two source observations

their spatial and multiwavelength properties can be well explained by beamed
emission as a consequence of supercritical accretion.
  Binaries with a neutron star or moderate mass black-hole (up to 20\msun), and

poor ([Fe/H]=-2.7) stars LP625-44 and LP706-7. We find that a high neutron
exposure and a small overlap factor are necessary to fit the abundance pattern
observed in these two metal-deficient stars, particularly the abundance ratios,
Pb/Ba $\approx 1$ and Ba/Sr $\approx 10$. We have also constructed stellar
models to better understand how such s-process conditions could arise. We have
calculated a 2$M_\odot$ model star with metallicity [Fe/H]=-2.7 from the ZAMS
up to AGB phase. We find that for such low-metallicity stars the He convective
shell reaches the bottom of the overlying H-rich envelope at the second thermal
pulse. Protons are then carried into the hotter He burning layers and $^{13}$C
is formed as protons mix into the He shell. Subsequently, material in the
H-flash driven convective zone experiences a high neutron exposure due to the
$^{13}$C($\alpha$, n) reaction. This results in a new neutron-capture s-process
paradigm in which the abundances are characterized by only one neutron
exposure. We suggest that this new s-process site may be a significant
contributor to the s-process abundances in low-metallicity ([Fe/H] $\le -2.5$)
stars.

evaluation of the full reptation model yields an excellent fit to the data for
both total chains and internal pieces and for all wave vectors and all times,
provided specific micro-structure effects of the MC-dynamics are negligible.
Such micro-structure effects show up for wave vectors of the order of the
inverse segment size. For the dynamics of the total chain our data analysis
based on the full reptation model shows the importance of tube length
fluctuations. Universal (Rouse-type) internal relaxation is unimportant. It can
be observed only in the form of the diffusive motion of a short central

of rods, vibration amplitude and frequency. The size of the vortices increases
with the number of rods. We characterize the growth of the ordered domains by
measuring the area fraction of the ordered regions as a function of time. A

investigate the impact of the direction of driving on the observed phenomena,
we performed experiments with the container vibrated horizontally. Although
vertical domains form, vortices are not observed. We therefore argue that the
motion is generated due to the interaction of the inclination of the rods with
the bottom of a vertically vibrated container. We also perform simple
experiments with a single row of rods in an annulus. These experiments directly
demonstrate that the rod motion is generated when the rods are inclined from
the vertical, and is always in the direction of the inclination.

propose a new term added to the previous elastic energy, which is associated
with the bending of layers. We show that there are two regimes for the
parallel-fracture solution of this elastic energy; near the fracture tip the
deformation field is governed by a parabolic differential equation while the
field away from the tip follows the usual elliptic equation. Analytical results
show that the fracture tip is lenticular, as suggested in a paper on a smectic
liquid crystal (P. G. de Gennes, Europhys. Lett. 13 (8), 709 (1990)). On the
contrary, away from the tip, the stress and deformation distribution recover
the usual singular behaviors (sqrt(x) and 1/sqrt(x), respectively, where x is
the distance from the tip). This indicates there is no enhancement in toughness
in the case of parallel fracture.

that the Kondo scaling involves many parameters, which makes the results depend
on concrete microscopic models. We illustrate this by the scaling calculations
of the Kondo temperature, $T_K$, as a function of the energy difference between
the singlet and triplet states $\Delta$. $T_K(\Delta)$ decreases with
increasing $\Delta$, showing a crossover from a power law with a universal
exponent to that with a nonuniversal exponent. The crossover depends on the
initial parameters of the model.

these microscopic models are sums over irregular, background-independent
lattices. We show that all of these issues can be addressed by the recent
application of the Kreimer Hopf algebra for quantum field theory
renormalization to non-perturbative statistical physics. The main difference
from standard renormalization group is that the Hopf algebra executes block
transformations in parts of the lattice only but in a controlled manner so that

We take the typical grid size as (505,505,253) for (x,y,z) and the maximum grid
size as (633,633,317). These grid numbers enable us to put the outer boundaries
of the computational domain near the local wave zone and hence to calculate
gravitational waveforms of good accuracy (within $\sim 10%$ error) for the
first time. To model neutron stars, we adopt a $\Gamma$-law equation of state
in the form $P=(\Gamma-1)\rho\epsilon$, where P, $\rho$, $\varep$ and $\Gamma$
are the pressure, rest mass density, specific internal energy, and adiabatic
constant. It is found that gravitational waves in the merger stage have
characteristic features that reflect the formed objects. In the case that a
massive, transient neutron star is formed, its quasi-periodic oscillations are
excited for a long duration, and this property is reflected clearly by the
quasi-periodic nature of waveforms and the energy luminosity. In the case of
black hole formation, the waveform and energy luminosity are likely damped
after a short merger stage. However, a quasi-periodic oscillation can still be
seen for a certain duration, because an oscillating transient massive object is
formed during the merger. This duration depends strongly on the initial
compactness of neutron stars and is reflected in the Fourier spectrum of
gravitational waves. To confirm our results and to calibrate the accuracy of
gravitational waveforms, we carried out a wide variety of test simulations,
changing the resolution and size of the computational domain.

corrections due to gluon emission in perturbative QCD, as well as power-behaved
corrections of nonperturbative origin. The latter are derived by demanding that
perturbatively resummed partonic observables should be analytic in the whole
$Q^2$-plane if they are to be related to physical observables measured in
experiments. I also show phenomenological consequences of this approach. The
focus is on the electromagnetic pion form factor to illustrate both effects,
Sudakov logarithms and power corrections in leading order of
$\Lambda_{\rm{QCD}}^2/Q^2$. The same approach applied to the inclusive
Drell-Yan cross section enables us to perform an absolutely normalized
calculation of the leading power correction in $b^2\Lambda_{\rm{QCD}}^2$ (b
being the impact parameter), which after exponentiation, gives rise to a
nonperturbative Sudakov-type contribution that provides enhancement rather than
suppression, hence partly counteracting the perturbative Sudakov suppression.

Dirac-type matrices $\Gamma^{(N)}_\mu$ are embedded into a Clifford algebra

is dual to a three-dimensional field theory whose renormalisation group flow
runs from the conformal fixed point in the infra-red regime to a non-conformal

a phase transition associated with a naked singularity of the M2-brane. In the

nuclear forces gives rise to low energy nucleon dynamics which is governed by
the generalized dynamical equation with a nonlocal-in-time interaction

Various simplifications are often introduced, including an assumption that the
two-time correlation function is proportional to the renormalized infinitesimal
propagator (Green's function), i.e. the decorrelation rate for fluctuations is
equal to the decay rate for perturbations. While this is a rigorous result of
the fluctuation--dissipation theorem for thermal equilibrium, it does not
necessarily apply to all types of turbulence. Building on previous work on
realizable Markovian closures, we explore a way to allow the decorrelation and
decay rates to differ (which in some cases affords a more accurate treatment of
effects such as non-white noise), while retaining the computational advantages
of a Markovian approximation. Some Markovian approximations differ only in the
initial transient phase, but the multiple-rate Markovian closure (MRMC)
presented here could modify the steady-state spectra as well. Markovian models
can be used directly in studying turbulence in a wide range of physical
problems (including zonal flows, of recent interest in plasma physics), or they
