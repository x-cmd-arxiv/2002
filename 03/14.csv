  November 2001, ESTEC, The Netherlands",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The X-ray binary pulsar Her X-1 shows a wide variety of long and short term
variabilities in the X-ray light curve. The 35 d variability of the source is
interpreted as the influence of a warped, inclined, and twisted accretion disk
periodically covering the line of sight to the central neutron star. In 1997
September we observed the ``turn-on'' of a 35 d cycle with the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer (RXTE). Spectral analysis reveals that during early phases of
the turn-on the overall spectrum is composed of X-rays scattered into the line
of sight plus heavily absorbed X-rays. This interpretation is consistent with
the variation of the pulse profile observed at the same time. The overall shape
of the pulse profile is not changing, but towards earlier phases of the turn-on
the pulse signature is steadily ``washed out''. This behavior can be understood
as an influence of scattering and absorption due to the presence of the
accretion disk rim. Using a Monte Carlo code we simulate the influence of both
processes on a time variable, beamed emission characteristic, similar to the
pulse profile of Her X-1. By comparing the results of the simulation with the
observed profiles we determine the amount of scattered radiation, absorbed
radiation, and the size of the scattering region.

to microlensing by the stellar populations of intervening elliptical/S0
galaxies is computed by combining the joint distribution of effective
microlensing convergence (kappa) and shear (gamma) with microlensing
magnification patterns. Microlensing is common in multiply imaged sources. We
find that 1 in 3 multiply imaged quasars should vary by more than 0.5
magnitudes per decade due to microlensing, while 10% of macrolensed GRB
afterglows should show a departure of more than 0.5 magnitudes from their
intrinsic light-curve during the first 30 days. However microlensing by stars
is rare in general, with only 1 source in ~500 varying by more than 0.5
magnitudes during the same periods. We find that most microlensing by stars
will be observed in a regime where gamma>0.1. Thus point-mass lenses do not
provide an adequate description for most microlensing events. If dark matter
halos contain a large fraction of mass in compact objects, the fraction of
microlensed (by 0.5 magnitudes) images rises significantly to ~1 in 10 for
quasars and ~1 in 5 for GRB afterglows. Comparison of variability between
macrolensed and normal quasar images, and a moderate number of well sampled GRB
afterglow light-curves should therefore discover or refute the existence of
stellar mass compact objects in galaxy halos. While microlensing results in
departures of the distribution of magnifications from that of a smooth model,
the effect on the macrolensing magnification bias for the discovery of lenses
in quasar surveys is small. On the other hand, microlensing significantly
broadens the distribution of macrolensed image flux ratios.

of view. Through the measurements of the well-known asteroids Ceres, Pallas,
Juno and Vesta and the planets Uranus and Neptune it was possible to improve

We were also able to establish calibration schemes for the important slew end

the context of our current knowledge of size, shape and albedos, derived from
IRAS observations, occultation measurements and lightcurve inversion

only one was clearly detected and the radiometric results agreed with sizes
given by occultation and HST observations. Four different comets have clearly
been detected at 170 micron and two have marginal detections. The observational
results are presented to be used by thermal comet models in the future. The
nine ISOSS slews over Hale-Bopp revealed extended and asymmetric structures

plasmas with very large magnetic Prandtl numbers. In this regime, which is
realized in the interstellar medium, some accretion disks, protogalaxies,
galaxy-cluster gas, early Universe, etc., magnetic fluctuations can be excited
at scales below the viscous cutoff. The salient feature of the resulting
small-scale magnetic turbulence is the folded structure of the fields. It is
characterized by very rapid transverse spatial oscillation of the field
direction, while the field lines remain largely unbent up to the scale of the
flow. Quantitatively, the fluctuation level and the field-line geometry can be
studied in terms of the statistics of the field strength and of the field-line
curvature. In the kinematic limit, the distribution of the field strength is an
expanding lognormal, while that of the field-line curvature K is stationary and
has a power tail K^{-13/7}. The field strength and curvature are
anticorrelated, i.e. the growing fields are mostly flat, while the sharply
curved fields remain relatively weak. The field, therefore, settles into a
reduced-tension state. Numerical simulations demonstrate three essential
features of the nonlinear regime. First, the total magnetic energy is equal to
the total kinetic energy. Second, the intermittency is partially suppressed
compared to the kinematic case, as the fields become more volume-filling and
their distribution develops an exponential tail. Third, the folding structure
of the field is unchanged from the kinematic case: the anticorrelation between
the field strength and the curvature persists and the distribution of the
latter retains the same power tail. We propose a model of back reaction based
on the folding picture that reproduces all of the above numerical results.

than 90% at $n_{\rm H} > 10^6 {\rm cm}^{-3}$. Thus grains play a decisive role
in the process of magnetic flux loss. Approximating the flux loss time $t_B$ by
a power law $t_B \propto B^{-\gamma}$, where $B$ is the mean field strength in
the cloud, we find $\gamma \approx 2$, characteristic to ambipolar diffusion,
only at $n_{\rm H} < 10^7 {\rm cm}^{-3}$. At higher densities, $\gamma$
decreases steeply with $n_{\rm H}$, and finally at $n_{\rm H} \approx n_{\rm

effectively decouple from the gas, $\gamma << 1$ is attained, reminiscent of
Ohmic dissipation, though flux loss occurs about 10 times faster than by Ohmic
dissipation. Ohmic dissipation is dominant only at $n_{\rm H} > 1 \times

magnetic force at all densities, grains of opposite charges drift in opposite
directions at high densities, where grains are major contributors to the
frictional force. Although magnetic flux loss occurs significantly faster than
by Ohmic dissipation even at very high densities as $n_{\rm H} \approx n_{\rm

diffusion in which particles of opposite charges are supposed to drift as one

remnant G 69.4+1.2 in the emission lines of [O III], Halpha+[N II] and [S II].
The low ionization images reveal diffuse and filamentary emission in the
central and south, south-west areas of our field. Estimates of the [S
II]/Halpha ratio suggest that the detected emission in these areas originates
from shock heated gas, while the strong extended source in the north must be an
HII region. The medium ionization image of [O III] shows a single filament
close to the field center. Emission from [O III] is not detected elsewhere in
the field but only in the north from LBN 069.96+01.35. Deep long-slit spectra
taken at the position of the [O III] filament suggest shock velocities ~120
km/s, while in other areas velocities around 50 km/s are expected. The sulfur
lines ratio indicates electron densities less than 120 cm^{-3}. The absolute
Halpha flux is ~5 x 10^{-17} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} arcsec^{-2}. The optical
emission is very well correlated with the radio emission, especially in the
south west. The soft X-ray emission detected in the ROSAT All-Sky survey shows
a satisfactory degree of correlation with the optical data in the south-west
suggesting their association.

gamma-rays by the EGRET experiment aboard CGRO in 1995 during a gamma-ray
outburst at energies above 100 MeV lasting for five weeks.
  In this time period the blazar was significantly (~ 5.9 sigma) detected by
COMPTEL at 10-30 MeV. At lower COMPTEL energies the detection is marginal,
resulting in a hard MeV spectrum.
  The combined COMPTEL/EGRET energy spectrum shows a break at MeV energies. The
broad-band spectrum (radio - gamma-rays) shows that the gamma-ray emission
dominates the overall power output. On top of the 5-week gamma-ray outburst,
EGRET detected a huge flare lasting for > 1 day. Enhanced MeV emission (10 - 30

with respect to the emission above 100 MeV. Outside the 5-week flaring period

the most sensitive survey with imaging instruments in the soft X-ray band (0.1

and yielded a catalogue of about 1000 sources. Large efforts were undertaken to
identify and classify the X-ray sources according to the nature of their X-ray

electro-magnetic wavelength bands to screen out foreground stars and background
objects from the LMC intrinsic X-ray source population which comprises X-ray
binaries, supernova remnants and supersoft sources. However, the vast majority
of sources still remains of unknown nature. First deep XMM-Newton observations
of selected regions in the LMC demonstrate a large step forward in the
identification of LMC X-ray sources. The large collecting area together with
imaging detectors covering energies 0.1 - 15 keV with far improved spectral
resolution allows to determine the nature of an object directly from the X-ray
properties down to low flux levels of a few 10$^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.
First results of a deep observation north of LMC X-4 are presented, which

extended atmosphere, an atmosphere above the photosphere. The extended
atmosphere of R Sct is formed from matter which gradually have lifted up from
the photosphere through the pulsations of the star.
  In contrast to the abundant molecules around the star, the silicate dust
feature is weak and the dust mass-loss rate is only 10^{-11} solar mass per

  RV Tau stars are commonly considered as post-AGB stars. While a detached dust
envelope around R Sct is consistent with such an interpretation, we show that
its period evolution is slower than expected. We argue that R Sct may be a
thermal-pulsing AGB star, observed in a helium-burning phase.

to the fundamental electronic gap develops at about 0.44 eV. It corresponds to
the transition between vanadium dxy and the impurity band, which forms in the
middle of the pure NaV2O5 gap. Raman spectra measured with incident photon
energy larger then 2 eV show strong resonant behavior, due to the presence of

a table is partitioned by an off-line training procedure into disjoint

on-line compressor like gzip. We provide a new theory that unifies previous
experimental observations on partitioning and heuristic observations on column
permutation, all of which are used to improve compression rates. Based on the
theory, we devise the first on-line training algorithms for table compression,
which can be applied to individual files, not just continuously operating
sources; and also a new, off-line training algorithm, based on a link to the
asymmetric traveling salesman problem, which improves on prior work by
rearranging columns prior to partitioning. We demonstrate these results
experimentally. On various test files, the on-line algorithms provide 35-55%
improvement over gzip with negligible slowdown; the off-line reordering
provides up to 20% further improvement over partitioning alone. We also show
that a variation of the table compression problem is MAX-SNP hard.

non-barotropic polytropic stars in the Cowling approximation, including first
order rotational corrections. By taking into account the coupling between the
polar and axial equations, we find that, in contrast to previous results, the
$m=2$ $r$ modes are essentially unaffected by the continuous spectrum and exist
even for very relativistic stellar models. We perform our calculations both in
the time and frequency domain. In order to numerically solve the infinite
system of coupled equations, we truncate it at some value $l_{\rm max}$.
Although the time dependent equations can be numerically evolved without any
problems, the eigenvalue equations possess a singular structure, which is
related to the existence of a continuous spectrum. This prevents the numerical
computation of an eigenmode if its eigenfrequency falls inside the continuous
spectrum. The properties of the latter depend strongly on the cut-off value
$l_{\rm max}$ and it can consist of several either disconnected or overlapping
patches, which are the broader the more relativistic the stellar model is. By
discussing the dependence of the continuous spectrum as a function of both the
cut-off value $l_{\rm max}$ and the compactness $M/R$, we demonstrate how it
affects the inertial modes. Through the time evolutions we are able to show
that some of the inertial modes can actually exist inside the continuous
spectrum, but some cannot. For more compact and therefore more relativistic
stellar models, the width of the continuous spectrum strongly increases and as
a consequence, some of the inertial modes, which exist in less relativistic
stars, disappear.

channels above the top quark mass are $H^\pm\to tb$ and
$H^\pm\to\tau^\pm\nu_\tau$ which provide coverage in the low and high
$\tan\beta$ regions up to $\sim 600$ GeV. The achievable precisions on the
charged Higgs mass and $\tan\beta$ determination are also discussed. The
$H^\pm\to W^\pm h^0$ channel, though restricted to a small MSSM parameter
space, shows a viable signal in NMSSM where the parameter space is less
constrained. The observation of the channel $H^-\to\tau^-_L\nu_\tau + c.c.$ may
constitute a distinctive evidence for models with singlet neutrinos in large
extra dimensions.

representation of the Poincare' group on the one-particle Hilbert space. The
abstract real Hilbert subspace version of the Tomita-Takesaki theory enables us
to bypass some limitations of the Wigner formalism by introducing an intrinsic
spacetime localization. Our approach works also for continuous spin
representations to which we associate a net of von Neumann algebras on
spacelike cones with the Reeh-Schlieder property. The positivity of the energy
in the representation turns out to be equivalent to the isotony of the net, in
the spirit of Borchers theorem. Our procedure extends to other spacetimes
homogeneous under a group of geometric transformations as in the case of
conformal symmetries and de Sitter spacetime.

We show that $Q=(Z_{\beta}Z^T_{\beta})^{-1}$ for a zonotopal parallelotope
$P(Z)$ which is the Minkowski sum of column vectors $z_j$ of the $n\times r$

encounter essential interpreting difficulties, which the most known example is
the anomalous behaviour of the combination tone 2f1-f2. Without doubt the
phenomenon of combination tones is connected with nonlinear phenomena in the
human ear. Therefore, it is generally assumed that the explanation of this
phenomenon is possible on the level of the ear. This paper proposes different
approach, which assumes the existence of an additional mechanism beyond the
ear. The aim of this mechanism is to diminish sensitivity of the auditory
process to nonlinear distortions by appropriate decoding of sound information.
The general rule of construction and the mathematical model of such a mechanism
is proposed, which allows for the explanation of many problems associated with
combination tones. As a consequence an unexpected result is obtained with
regard to a combination tone 2f1-f2 that it can originate already from the
nonlinear distortion of the second order. This mathematical model is formulated
in terms of finite groups.

and $^{4}$He in an applied magnetic field B is studied using different
approximations of the atomic Hamiltonian. All optical transitions (line
positions and intensities) of the 1083 nm $2^{3}$S-$2^{3}$P transition are
computed as a function of B. The effect of metastability exchange collisions
between atoms in the ground state and in the $2^{3}$S metastable state is
studied, and rate equations are derived, for the populations these states in
the general case of an isotopic mixture in an arbitrary field B. It is shown
that the usual spin-temperature description remains valid. A simple optical
pumping model based on these rate equations is used to study the B-dependence
of the population couplings which result from the exchange collisions. Simple
spectroscopy measurements are performed using a single-frequency laser diode on
the 1083 nm transition. The accuracy of frequency scans and of measurements of
transition intensities is studied. Systematic experimental verifications are
made for B=0 to 1.5 T. Optical pumping effects resulting from hyperfine
decoupling in high field are observed to be in good agreement with the
predictions of the simple model. Based on adequately chosen absorption
measurements at 1083 nm, a general optical method to measure the nuclear
polarisation of the atoms in the ground state in an arbitrary field is
described. It is demonstrated at $B\sim$0.1 T, a field for which the usual
optical methods could not operate.

to the strong coupling between turbulent motions and reaction. The large amount
of heat released by a typical hydrocarbon flame leads to significant
modifications of the thermodynamic variables and the molecular transport
coefficients and thus alters the fluid dynamics. Additionally, in nonpremixed
combustion, the flame has a complex spatial structure. Localized expansions and
contractions occur, enhancing the dilatational motions. Therefore, the
compressibility of the flow and the heat release are intimately related.
However, fundamental studies of the role of compressibility on the scalar
mixing and reaction are scarce. In this paper we present results concerning the

upper and lower bounds of energy are calculated for a number of
non-relativistic three-body Coulomb and nuclear systems. The formulas for
calculation of upper and lower bounds for exponential basis are given, the
lower bounds for great part of systems were calculated for the first time. By
comparison of calculations for different bases the efficiency of exponential
trial functions and their universality in respect to masses of particles and
interaction are demonstrated. The advantage of exponential basis manifests
mostly evident for the systems with comparable masses, though its use in
one-center and two-center problems is justified too. For effective solution of
two-center problem a carcass modification of the trial function is proposed.
The stability of various three-particle Coulomb systems is analyzed.

A 66 (2002) 012311.","10.1103/PhysRevA.66.012311",,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum information is defined by applying the concepts of ordinary (Shannon)
information theory to a quantum sample space consisting of a single framework
or consistent family. A classical analogy for a spin-half particle and other
arguments show that the infinite amount of information needed to specify a
precise vector in its Hilbert space is not a measure of the information carried
by a quantum entity with a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space; the latter is,
instead, bounded by log d bits (1 bit per qubit). The two bits of information
transmitted in dense coding are located not in one but in the correlation
between two qubits, consistent with this bound. A quantum channel can be
thought of as a ""structure"" or collection of frameworks, and the physical
location of the information in the individual frameworks can be used to
identify the location of the channel. Analysis of a quantum circuit used as a
model of teleportation shows that the location of the channel depends upon
which structure is employed; for ordinary teleportation it is not (contrary to
Deutsch and Hayden) present in the two bits resulting from the Bell-basis
measurement, but in correlations of these with a distant qubit. In neither
teleportation nor dense coding does information travel backwards in time, nor
is it transmitted by nonlocal (superluminal) influences. It is (tentatively)
proposed that all aspects of quantum information can in principle be understood
in terms of the (basically classical) behavior of information in a particular
framework, along with the framework dependence of this information.

relation to entanglement in composite quantum systems consisting of well
separated subsystems. Our studies are motivated by recent experiments and
theoretical investigations on quantum dots and neutral atoms in microtraps as
tools for quantum information processing. We present analogies between
distinguishable particles, bosons and fermions in low-dimensional Hilbert
spaces. We introduce the notion of Slater rank for pure states of pairs of
fermions and bosons in analogy to the Schmidt rank for pairs of distinguishable
particles. This concept is generalized to mixed states and provides a
correlation measure for indistinguishable particles. Then we generalize these
notions to pure fermionic and bosonic states in higher-dimensional Hilbert
spaces and also to the multi-particle case. We review the results on quantum
correlations in mixed fermionic states and discuss the concept of fermionic
Slater witnesses. Then the theory of quantum correlations in mixed bosonic
states and of bosonic Slater witnesses is formulated. In both cases we provide
methods of constructing optimal Slater witnesses that detect the degree of
quantum correlations in mixed fermionic and bosonic states.

general simulations, while considering the required number of time steps only
for special cases (decoupling and time-reversal). These two complexity measures
differ significantly. Here we derive lower bounds on the number of time steps
for general simulations. In particular, the simulation of interaction graphs
with irrational spectrum requires at least n steps. We discuss as examples
graphs that correspond to graph codes and nearest neighbor interactions in 1-

tight.
