thought to be highly polarized. However, because of the different orientations
of the magnetic field over the surface of the neutron star (NS), it is commonly
assumed that the net observed polarization will be significantly reduced as the
polarization from different regions will cancel each other. We show that the
birefringence of the magnetized QED vacuum decouples the polarization modes in
the magnetosphere; therefore, the direction of the polarization follows the
direction of the magnetic field up to a large distance from the stellar
surface. At this distance, the rays that leave the surface and are destined for
our detectors pass through only a small solid angle; consequently, the
polarization direction of the emission originating in different regions will
tend to align together. The net observed polarization of the thermal radiation
of NSs should therefore be very large. Measurement of this polarization will be
the first direct evidence of the birefringence of the magnetized vacuum due to
QED and a direct probe of behavior of the vacuum at magnetic fields of order of
and above the critical QED field of 4.4 x 10 13 G. The large observable
polarization will also help us learn more about the atmospheric properties of

The link between c1, normally a surface gravity indicator, and metallicity

(EHB) are found in the UV color-magnitude diagrams of omega Cen and NGC 2808.
Such stars are unexplained by canonical HB theory. In order to explore the
origin of these subluminous stars, we evolved a set of low-mass stars from the
main sequence through the helium-core flash to the HB for a wide range in the
mass loss along the red-giant branch (RGB). Stars with the largest mass loss
evolve off the RGB to high effective temperatures before igniting helium in
their cores. Our results indicate that the subluminous EHB stars, as well as
the gap within the EHB of NGC 2808, can be explained if these stars undergo a
late helium-core flash on the white-dwarf cooling curve. Under these conditions
the flash convection will penetrate into the stellar envelope, thereby mixing
most, if not all, of the envelope hydrogen into the hot helium- burning
interior. This phenomenon is analogous to the ""born-again"" scenario for
producing hydrogen-deficient stars during a very late helium-shell flash.
""Flash mixing"" greatly enhances the envelope helium and carbon abundances and,
as a result, leads to an abrupt increase in the HB effective temperature. We
argue that the EHB gap in NGC 2808 is caused by this theoretically predicted
dichotomy in the HB morphology. Using new helium- and carbon-rich stellar
atmospheres, we show that the flash-mixed stars have the same reduced UV flux
as the subluminous EHB stars. Moreover, we demonstrate that models without
flash mixing lie, at most, ~0.1 mag below the EHB and hence fail to explain the
observations. Flash mixing may also provide a new evolutionary channel for
producing the high gravity, He-rich sdO and sdB stars.

J100424.9+122922 is the second lensed system to be found in this program,
suggesting that many gravitational lenses are probably missed from conventional
optical quasar surveys. We have made a simple lens model and a rough estimate
of the reddening in the immediate environment of the quasar which suggests that
the quasar is intrinsically very luminous and is accreting at close to the
Eddington limit of its ~10^9 M_sun black hole. The lensing galaxy has a small
amount of dust which is responsible for some excess reddening observed in the
fainter image of the quasar, but is otherwise a fairly typical massive
elliptical galaxy. We model the selection effects working against the detection
of red quasars in both lensed and unlensed samples. We show that these
selection effects are very effective at removing even lightly-reddened high
redshift quasars from magnitude-limited samples, whether they are lensed or
not. This suggests that the red quasar population in general could be very
large, and in particular the class of iron broad absorption line quasars of

thermal instability (TI) in the context of the atomic interstellar medium
(ISM), in order to assess the ability of TI to establish a well-segregated
multi-phase structure in the turbulent ISM. The key parameter is the ratio of
the cooling time to the dynamical crossing time $\eta$. The isobaric density
perturbations of sizes $\gtrsim 15$ pc in media with mean density $\sim 1$
cm$^{-3}$ develop inflow motions with Mach number larger than 0.5 and a shock
that propagates outwards from the condensation and brings the surrounding
medium out of thermal equilibrium. The time for the dynamical transient state
to subside ranges from 4 to 30 Myr for initial density perturbations of 20% and
sizes 3 to 75 pc. By the time the condensations have formed, a substantial
fraction of the mass is still traversing the unstable range and, therefore,
clouds formed by TI should be bounded by accreting gas traversing the unstable
range, rather than by sharp transitions to the stable warm phase. In the
presence of random velocity forcing the condensation process can be suppressed
for arbitrarily long times if the forcing causes a moderate rms Mach number
($\gtrsim 0.3$) and extends to small enough scales that $\eta>1$. We suggest
that these mechanisms may be at the origin of the relatively large amounts of
gas mass in the unstable regime. We remark that in the (stable) warm diffuse
medium, $\eta>1$ for velocity perturbations of scales up to several pc. The
flow's response to them is thus nearly adiabatic, and relatively weakly
compressible, consistent with observations that suggest a nearly Kolmogorov
power spectrum in this medium.

of t_*f with stellar mass dictates whether massive stars can form
simultaneously with low-mass stars in clusters. Here we show that t_*f is
determined by conditions in the star's natal cloud, and is typically ~10^5 yr.
The corresponding mass accretion rate depends on the pressure within the cloud

and final stellar masses. Characteristic accretion rates are sufficient to
overcome radiation pressure from ~100 solar mass protostars, while
simultaneously driving intense bipolar gas outflows. The weak dependence of

(BHs) in galactic nuclei. We use the velocity dispersions of early-type
galaxies obtained by the SDSS and the relation between BH mass and velocity
dispersion to estimate the local BH mass density to be 2.5x10^5 Msun/Mpc^3. We
also use the QSO luminosity function from the 2dF Redshift Survey to estimate
the BH mass density accreted during optically bright QSO phases. The local BH
mass density is consistent with the density accreted during optically bright
QSO phases if QSOs have an efficiency 0.1. By studying the continuity equation
for the BH mass distribution, including the effect of BH mergers, we find
relations between the local BH mass function and the QSO luminosity function.
If the BH mass is assumed to be conserved during BH mergers, comparison of the
predicted relations with the observations suggests that luminous QSOs
(L_{bol}>10^{46} erg/s) have a high efficiency (e.g. 0.2), and the growth of
high-mass BHs (>10^8 Msun) comes mainly from accretion during optically bright
QSO phases, or that luminous QSOs have a super-Eddington luminosity. If
luminous QSOs are not accreting with super-Eddington luminosities and the
growth of low-mass BHs also occurs mainly during optically bright QSO phases,
less luminous QSOs must accrete with a low efficiency <0.1; alternatively, they
may accrete with high efficiency, but a significant fraction should be
obscured. We estimate that the mean lifetime of luminous QSOs is (3-13)x10^7
yr, which is comparable to the Salpeter time. We also investigate the case in
which total BH mass decreases during BH mergers due to gravitational radiation,
and the observations again suggest that BHs in most luminous QSOs are Kerr BHs
accreting with an efficiency >0.1.

_{c}/\rho_{ab} to decrease at low temperatures. Most notably, it is found that
\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} at moderate temperatures (100 - 300 K) is almost completely
independent of doping in the non-superconducting regime (x = 0.01 to 0.05);
this indicates that the same charge confinement mechanism that renormalizes the
c-axis hopping rate is at work down to x = 0.01. It is discussed that this
striking x-independence of \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} is consistent with the idea that
holes form a self-organized network of hole-rich regions, which also explains
the unusually metallic in-plane transport of the holes in the lightly-doped
region. Furthermore, the data for x > 0.05 suggest that the emergence of the
superconductivity is related to an increase in the c-axis coupling.

weak subdominant triplet pairing interaction between electrons with
antiparallel spins, in addition to a dominant singlet pairing interaction. An
order-parameter mixing effect enhances the FFLO state, and plays an essential
role in the semi-quantitative agreement. As a possible origin of the small
triplet component, pairing interactions mediated by spin fluctuations are
proposed. It is discussed that in this mechanism of the pairing interactions
equal spin pairing interactions are much weaker than the antiparallel spin
pairing interactions in the strong magnetic field, which is consistent with the

only near x = 0.25, where it cannot be quenched effectively and Tc is reduced
below 1K. We found that the high Tc's which were sometimes deduced from
resistivity measurements, and attributed to compounds with .25 < x < .30, are
to be ascribed to interfacial superconductivity which generates spectacular
non-linear effects. We also clarified the effect of acid etching and set more
precisely the low-rubidium-content boundary of the hexagonal phase.This work
makes clear that Tc would increase continuously (from 2 K to 5.5 K) as we
approach this boundary (x = 0.20), if no ordering would take place - as its is
approximately the case in CsxWO3. This behaviour is reminiscent of the
tetragonal tungsten bronze NaxWO3 and asks the same question : what mechanism
is responsible for this large increase of Tc despite the considerable
associated reduction of the electron density of state ? By reviewing the other
available data on these bronzes we conclude that the theoretical models which
are able to answer this question are probably those where the instability of
the lattice plays a major role and, particularly, the model which call upon
local structural excitations (LSE), associated with the missing alkali atoms.

interact, a spacelike curvature singularity or Cauchy horizon develops because
of mutual focusing. We show with an exact solution that the collision of

singularities on null surfaces and that this is a transition phase between
spacelike singularities and regular horizons. Divergences of tidal forces in
the null singularities is shown to be weaker relative to the spacelike ones.
Using the local isometry between colliding plane waves and black holes, we show
that the inner horizon of Reissner-Nordstrom black hole transforms into a null
singularity when a particular scalar field is coupled to it. We also present an
analytic exact solution, which represents a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole with

makes matched filtering an attractive detection strategy. This detection method
involves the filtering of the detector output with a set of theoretical
waveforms or templates. One of the most important factors in this strategy is
knowing how many templates are needed in order to reduce the loss of possible
signals. In this study we calculate the number of templates and computational
power needed for a one-step search for gravitational waves from inspiralling
binary systems. We build on previous works by firstly expanding the
post-Newtonian waveforms to 2.5-PN order and secondly, for the first time,
calculating the number of templates needed when using P-approximant waveforms.
The analysis is carried out for the four main first-generation interferometers,
LIGO, GEO600, VIRGO and TAMA. As well as template number, we also calculate the
computational cost of generating banks of templates for filtering GW data. We
carry out the calculations for two initial conditions. In the first case we
assume a minimum individual mass of $1 M_{\odot}$ and in the second, we assume
a minimum individual mass of $5 M_{\odot}$. We find that, in general, we need
more P-approximant templates to carry out a search than if we use standard PN
templates. This increase varies according to the order of PN-approximation, but
can be as high as a factor of 3 and is explained by the smaller span of the
P-approximant templates as we go to higher masses. The promising outcome is
that for 2-PN templates the increase is small and is outweighed by the known
robustness of the 2-PN P-approximant templates.

sfermion mass degeneracy, irrespective of the dominant source of supersymmetry

the running of soft $({\rm mass})^2$ stemming from the nonzero energy density

Q$-ball formation. The running in presence of gauge and Yukawa couplings
becomes strong if $m_{1/2}/m_0$ is sufficiently large. Moreover, the $\rm
Q$-balls which are formed during the early oscillations constantly evolve, due
to the redshift of the Hubble-induced soft mass, until the low-energy
supersymmtery breaking becomes dominant. For smaller $m_{1/2}/m_0$, $\rm
Q$-balls are not formed during early oscillations because of the shrinking of
the instability band due to the Hubble expansion. In this case the $\rm

charges, as a result of their amplitude redshift. Therefore, the Hubble-induced
corrections to the flat directions give rise to a successful $\rm Q$-ball
cosmology.

and breather solutions are unavailable. We construct for each of these
equations classes of modified scattering solutions, which exist globally in
time, and are asymptotic to solutions of the corresponding linear equations up
to explicit phase shifts. These solutions are used to demonstrate lack of local
well-posedness in certain Sobolev spaces,in the sense that the dependence of
solutions upon initial data fails to be uniformly continuous. In particular, we
show that the mKdV flow is not uniformly continuous in the $L^2$ topology,
despite the existence of global weak solutions at this regularity.
  Finally, we investigate the KdV equation at the endpoint regularity
$H^{-3/4}$, and construct solutions for both the real and complex KdV
equations. The construction provides a nontrivial time interval $[-T,T]$ and a
locally Lipschitz continuous map taking the initial data in $H^{-3/4}$ to a
distributional solution $u \in C^0 ([-T,T]; $H^{-3/4})$ which is uniquely
defined for all smooth data. The proof uses a generalized Miura transform to

SO(3) monopoles, obtaining a formula relating the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten
invariants of smooth four-manifolds using the SO(3)-monopole cobordism. The
main technical difficulty in the SO(3)-monopole program relating the
Seiberg-Witten and Donaldson invariants has been to compute intersection
pairings on links of strata of reducible SO(3) monopoles, namely the moduli
spaces of Seiberg-Witten monopoles lying in lower-level strata of the Uhlenbeck
compactification of the moduli space of SO(3) monopoles [arXiv:dg-ga/9710032].
In this monograph, we prove --- modulo a gluing theorem which is an extension
of our earlier work in [arXiv:math/9907107] --- that these intersection
pairings can be expressed in terms of topological data and Seiberg-Witten
invariants of the four-manifold. This conclusion is analogous to the
Kotschick-Morgan conjecture concerning the wall-crossing formula for Donaldson
invariants of a four-manifold with $b_2^+=1$; that wall-crossing formula and
the resulting structure of Donaldson invariants for four-manifolds with
$b_2^+=1$ were established, assuming the Kotschick-Morgan conjecture, by
Goettsche [arXiv:alg-geom/9506018] and Goettsche and Zagier

factors binding to rather short recognition motifs generally located upstream

regulatory elements in the upstream region of eukaryotic genes. The genes are
grouped in sets sharing an overrepresented short motif in their upstream
sequence. For each set, the average expression level from a microarray
experiment is determined: If this level is significantly higher or lower than
the average taken over the whole genome, then the overerpresented motif shared
by the genes in the set is likely to play a role in their regulation. The
method was tested by applying it to the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
using the publicly available results of a DNA microarray experiment, in which
expression levels for virtually all the genes were measured during the diauxic
shift from fermentation to respiration. Several known motifs were correctly
identified, and a new candidate regulatory sequence was determined.
