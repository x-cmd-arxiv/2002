confine the radio plasma of such galaxies. Velocities derived from the spectra

extended X-ray emission combined with a statistical excess of neighboring

irregular galaxy Sextans A. The supergiants were identified in previously
published stellar photometry measured from Hubble Space Telescope imaging. The
high resolution imaging and low dust environment provided high photometric
accuracy such that the main sequence and blue He-burning supergiants are
clearly separated. This allows us to isolate the He-burning phase at both the
red and blue ends of the so called ``blue-loops''. The B/R supergiant ratio
provides an observational constraint on the relative lifetimes of these two
phases which is a sensitive test for convection, mass loss, and rotation
parameters. These parameters have direct implications for the period-luminosity
relationship for Cepheid variable stars. Previous studies have used a single
number to represent this ratio. However, since the B/R ratio is a fairly strong
function of mass for a single age stellar population, both changes in recent
star formation rate and choice of luminosity cut-off can dramatically affect
the result. We have analyzed the ratio as a function of age, or equivalently,
mass. This method eliminates the confusion of unknown star formation histories
so that B/R can be a more reliable diagnostic tool. We compare the result with
a model based on stellar evolution tracks of an appropriate metallicity. The
functional form of the observed ratio matches the model extremely well.
However, the observed B/R ratio is lower than the model by a factor of two.
This result suggests that stellar rotation is an important effect in the
evolution of these stars.

The radial velocity curve of the blue absorption system, however, does not
track the hot companion's orbital motion in a straightforward way, and its
departures from an expected circular orbit are particularly strong when the hot
component is active. We suggest that the cF-type absorption system is formed in
material streaming from the giant presumably in a region where the stream
encounters an accretion disk or an extended envelope around the hot component.
The broad emission wings originate from the inner accretion disk or the
envelope around the hot star.We also suggest that the central absorption in H
profiles is formed in a neutral portion of the cool giant's wind which is
strongly concentrated towards the orbital plane. The nebula in AR Pav seems to
be bounded by significant amount of neutral material in the orbital plane. The
forbidden emission lines are probably formed in low density ionized regions

ions (from C to Si) and Fe-L-shell ions dominate the spectrum. Strong, narrow
radiative recombination continua (RRC) for several ions are also present,
implying that most of the observed soft-X-ray emission arises in
low-temperature (few eV) plasma. This plasma is photoionized by the inferred
nuclear continuum (obscured along our line of sight), as in the unified model
of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find excess emission (compared with pure
recombination) in all resonance lines (np to 1s) up to the photoelectric edge,
demonstrating the importance of photoexcitation as well. We introduce a simple
model of a cone of plasma irradiated by the nuclear continuum; the line
emission we observe along our line of sight perpendicular to the cone is
produced through recombination/radiative cascade following photoionization and
radiative decay following photoexcitation. A remarkably good fit is obtained to
the H-like/He-like ionic line series, with inferred radial ionic column
densities consistent with recent observations of warm absorbers in Seyfert 1
galaxies. Previous Chandra imaging revealed a large (extending out to 500 pc)
ionization cone containing most of the X-ray flux, implying that the warm
absorber in NGC 1068 is a large-scale outflow. To explain the ionic column
densities, a broad, flat distribution in the logarithm of the ionization
parameter ($\xi=L_X/n_e r^2$) is necessary, spanning $\log\xi=0$--3. This
suggests either radially-stratified ionization zones or the existence of a
broad density distribution (spanning a few orders of magnitude) at each radius.

disk surface brightness yields v_{rot} ~ I_0^{0.50+/-0.05}h^{0.77+/-0.07}

mass-to- light ratio (within 4 disk scale-lengths) is largely independent of
surface brightness, varying as I_0^{0.00+/-0.10}h^{0.54+/-0.14}. Consistent
results were obtained when the expanse of the analysis was truncated by
excluding the low surface brightness galaxies. Previous claims that M/L_B
varies with I_0^{-1/2} are shown to be misleading and/or due to galaxy
selection effects. Not all low-surface-brightness disk galaxies are dark matter
dominated. The situation is however different in the near-infrared where L_{K'}

spiral galaxy disks should not assume a constant M/L ratio within any given
passband. The B-band dynamical mass-to-light ratio (within 4 disk
scale-lengths) has no obvious correlation with (B-R) disk colour, while in the
K'-band it varies as -1.25+/-0.28(B-R). Combining the present observational
data with recent galaxy model predictions implies that the logarithm of the

become redder, varying as 1 .70+/-0.28(B-R).

continued upto 1 Gyr, or continued further. The other two events have taken
place around 300 Myr, and 100 Myr. A few star clusters were formed during the
first of the three star formation events in 5 regions. On all the six regions,
a good correlation is seen between the star and cluster formation events which

correlate with the interaction of LMC with Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and

black hole surrounded by a thick disk formed after the merging of a system of
compact objects or the collapse of a massive star. Energy released from the
accretion of disk material by the black hole or from the rotation of the hole
itself extracted by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism powers a relativistic wind
along the system axis. Lorentz factors of several hundreds are needed to solve
the compactness problem in the wind which implies the injection of a tremendous
power into a very small amount of matter. The Blandford-Znajek mechanism, where
the outflow follows magnetic field lines anchored to the black hole is probably
the best way to prevent baryonic pollution and can even initially produce a
purely leptonic wind. In this paper we rather study the wind emitted from the
inner part of the disk where the risk of baryonic pollution is much larger
since the outflow originates from high density regions. We show that the
baryonic load of this wind sensitively depends on the disk temperature and
magnetic field geometry and that the outflow can become ultra-relativistic
(Lorentz factor Gamma>100) under quite restrictive conditions only. Conversely,
if Gamma remains of the order of unity the dense wind emitted from the inner
disk could help to confine the central jet but may also represent a source of
baryon contamination for the Blandford-Znajek mechanism.

a factor ~2-3 to z = 0.5) in favor of the spiral galaxy fraction while the
number of bright ellipticals does not seem to change. The infalling field
galaxy population that successively builds up the cluster also is spiral rich
and S0 poor. It has hence been suspected that galaxy transformation processes,
either due to galaxy -- galaxy or to galaxy -- ICM interactions, are
responsible for this change. Complementing dynamical and morphological studies,
we use evolutionary synthesis models describing various possible effects of
those interactions on the star formation rates of the infalling spirals. We
study the effects of starbursts of various strengths as well as of the
truncation of star formation on the color and luminosity evolution of model
galaxies of various spectral types. Comparison with observed properties of the
local S0 galaxy population is used to constrain possible S0 formation
mechanisms. We find that star formation truncation in spiral galaxies earlier
than Sd-type, if occurring not too long ago, as well as starbursts more than 3
Gyr ago and followed by complete star formation extinction in spirals -- again
earlier than Sd-- may well account for the observed average S0 luminosities and
colors. Late-type galaxies (Sd), even after a strong burst, remain either too
blue or too faint. Our results are in agreement with studies of spectral

being 0.75 deg^2), which samples the galaxy out to its tidal radius. Derivation
of the SFH has been performed using the synthetic partial model technique.
  The resulting SFH shows that Ursa Minor hosts a predominantly old stellar
population, with virtually all the stars formed earlier than 10 Gyr ago and 90%
of them formed earlier than 13 Gyr ago. Nevertheless, Ursa Minor
color-magnitude diagram shows several stars above the main, old turn-off
forming a blue-plume (BP). If these stars were genuine, main-sequence stars,
Ursa Minor would have maintained a low star formation rate extending up to 2
Gyr ago. However, several indications (relative amount and spatial distribution
of BP stars and difficulty to retain processed gas) play against this
possibility. In such context, the most reliable hypothesis is that BP stars are
blue-stragglers originating in the old population, Ursa Minor hence remaining
the only Milky Way dSph satellite to host a pure old stellar population. A
marginally significant age gradient is detected, in the sense that stars in
outer regions are slightly younger, in average.
  The distance of Ursa Minor, has been calculated using the magnitude of the
horizontal-branch and a calibration based on Hipparcos data of main sequence
sub-dwarfs. We estimated a distance d=76+/-4 Kpc, which is slightly larger than
previous estimates. From the RGB color, we estimate a metallicity
[Fe/H]=-1.9+/-0.2, in agreement with a previous spectroscopic determination. No
metallicity gradients have been detected across the galaxy.

metallicities, if interpreted by strong CN-bands, result from progressively
higher N and perhaps C abundances in comparison to iron. We see an enrichment
already among the metal-poor population, which is difficult to explain by
self-enrichment alone. An attractive speculation (done before) is that omega
Cen was the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy. We propose a scenario in which omega Cen
experienced mass inflow over a long period of time, until the gas content of
its host galaxy was so low that star formation in omega Cen stopped, or
alternatively the gas was stripped off during its infall in the Milky Way
potential. This mass inflow could have occurred in a clumpy and discontinuous
manner, explaining the second peak of metallicities, the abundance pattern, and
the asymmetrical spatial distribution of the most metal-rich population.

amounts to tuning kernel parameters and the slack penalty coefficient $C$. We
begin by reviewing a recently developed probabilistic framework for SVM
classification. An extension to the case of SVMs with quadratic slack penalties
is given and a simple approximation for the evidence is derived, which can be
used as a criterion for model selection. We also derive the exact gradients of
the evidence in terms of posterior averages and describe how they can be
estimated numerically using Hybrid Monte Carlo techniques. Though
computationally demanding, the resulting gradient ascent algorithm is a useful
baseline tool for probabilistic SVM model selection, since it can locate maxima
of the exact (unapproximated) evidence. We then perform extensive experiments
on several benchmark data sets. The aim of these experiments is to compare the
performance of probabilistic model selection criteria with alternatives based
on estimates of the test error, namely the so-called ``span estimate'' and
Wahba's Generalized Approximate Cross-Validation (GACV) error. We find that all
the ``simple'' model criteria (Laplace evidence approximations, and the Span
and GACV error estimates) exhibit multiple local optima with respect to the
hyperparameters. While some of these give performance that is competitive with
results from other approaches in the literature, a significant fraction lead to
rather higher test errors. The results for the evidence gradient ascent method
show that also the exact evidence exhibits local optima, but these give test
errors which are much less variable and also consistently lower than for the
simpler model selection criteria.

boundary terms of the action of the associated dynamic field theory are
identified, the implied boundary conditions are derived, and the
renormalization of the model in $d<6$ bulk dimensions is clarified. Two
distinct renormalization schemes are utilized. The first is a massless one
based on minimal subtraction of dimensional poles and the dimensionality
expansion about $d=6$. To overcome its problems in going below $d=4$
dimensions, a massive one for fixed dimensions $d\le 4$ is constructed. The
resulting renormalization group (or Callan Symanzik) equations are exploited to
obtain the scaling forms of surface quantities like the dynamic structure
factor. In conjunction with boundary operator expansions scaling relations
follow that relate the critical indices of the dynamic and static infrared
singularities of surface quantities to familiar \emph{static} bulk and surface
exponents. To test the predicted scaling forms and scaling-law expressions for
the critical exponents involved, accurate computer-simulation data are

recoil energy spectrum from pointlike dark-matter particles, e.g., neutralinos,
is determined by the velocity distribution of dark matter in the galactic halo
and by nuclear form factors. In contrast, typical cross sections of
non-pointlike dark matter, for example, Q-balls, have a new form factor, which
decreases rapidly with the recoil energy. Therefore, a signal from
non-pointlike dark matter is expected to peak near the experimental threshold
and to fall off rapidly at higher energies. Although the width of the signal is
practically independent of the dark matter velocity dispersion, its height is
expected to exhibit an annual modulation due to the changes in the dark matter
flux.

scattering of an electron off a complex square barrier. As is well known the
(negative) imaginary part of the potential takes into account,
phenomenologically, the absorption. We investigate the so-called
Hartman-Fletcher effect, and find that it is suppressed by the presence of a
(not negligible) imaginary potential. In fact, when a sufficiently large
absorption is present, the asymptotical transmission speed is finite. Actually,
the tunnelling time does increase linearly with the barrier width. A recent
optical experiment seems to be in agreement with our theoretical previsions.

two qubits is to transform it to a Bell diagonal state. In this paper we derive
an explicit form of the local operation that can realize such a transformation.
The result obtained is universal for arbitrary entangled two-qubit states and
it discloses that the corresponding local filter is not unique for density
matrices with rank $n=2$ and can be exclusively determined for that with $n=3$
and 4. As illustrations, a four-parameters family of mixed states are explored,
the local filter as well as the transformation probability are given
explicitly, which verify the validity of the general result.

  examples and eliminate some errors within them. 16 pages (two columns in PR's
  format), 4 figures. This is an extended version of quant-ph/0001023",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We present the modified relative entropy of entanglement (MRE) that is proved
to be a upper bound of distillable entanglement (DE), also relative entropy of
entanglement (RE), and a lower bound of entanglement of formation (EF). For a
pure state, MRE is found by the requirement that MRE is equal to EF. For a
mixed state, MRE is calculated by defining a total relative density matrix. We
obtain an explicit and ""weak"" closed expressions of MRE that depends on the
pure state decompositions for two qubit systems and give out an algorithm to
calculate MRE in principle for more qubit systems. MRE significantly improves
the computability of RE, decreases the sensitivity on the pure state
decompositions in EF, reveals the particular difference of similar departure
states from Bell's state and restore the logarithmic dependence on probability
of component states consistent with information theory. As examples, we
calculate MRE of the mixture of Bell's states and departure states from Bell's
states, and compare them with EF as well as Wootters' EF. Moreover we study the
important properties of MRE including the behavior under local general
measurement (LGM) and classical communication (CC).

and generalized for arbitrary detection scheme.
