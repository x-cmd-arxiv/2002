first attempt to do this by exploring whether the few well-studied sub-mm/mm
sources are consistent with the well-established K-z relation for powerful
radio galaxies. Out to z = 3 this appears to be the case, providing evidence
that bright sub-mm sources are indeed destined to be massive ellipticals. At
higher redshifts there is a suggestion that sub-mm galaxies are signficantly
fainter at K than their radio-selected counterparts, but at present it is
unclear whether this indicates a significant difference in stellar mass or the
increasing impact of dust obscuration on the rest-frame light from the sub-mm

  Discussion of previous theoretical studies extended",,"10.1086/340663",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent X-ray observations have been used to demonstrate that the cluster gas
mass-temperature relation is steeper than theoretical self-similar predictions
drawn from numerical simulations that consider the evolution of the cluster gas
through the effects of gravity and shock heating alone. One possible
explanation for this is that the gas mass fraction is not constant across
clusters of different temperature, as is usually assumed. Observationally,
however, there is no compelling evidence for gas mass fraction variation,
especially in the case of hot clusters. Seeking an alternative physical
explanation for the observed trends, we investigate the role in the cluster gas
mass - temperature relation of the preheating of the intracluster medium by
some arbitrary source for clusters with emission-weighted mean temperatures of
greater than about 3 keV. Making use of the physically-motivated, analytic
models developed in 2002 by Babul and coworkers, we find that preheating does,
indeed, lead to a steeper relation. This is in agreement with previous
theoretical studies on the relation. However, in apparent conflict with these
studies, we argue that a ``high'' level of entropy injection is required to
match observations. In particular, an entropy floor of greater than about 300
keV cm^2 is required. We also present a new test, namely, the study of the
relation within different fixed radii. This allows one to indirectly probe the
density profiles of clusters, since it samples different fractions of the
virial radius for clusters of different temperature. This test also confirms
that a high level of preheating is required to match observations.

the flare was powered by the fallback of debris rather than subsequent
accretion via a thin disk. The fallback model allows constraints to be set on
the black hole mass and the mass of debris. The latter must be very much less
than a solar mass to explain the very low luminosity of the flare. The
observations can be explained either as the partial stripping of the outer
layers of a low-mass main sequence star or as the disruption of a brown dwarf
or a giant planet. We find that the X-ray emission in the flare must have
originated within a small patch rather than over the entire torus of
circularized material surrounding the black hole. We suggest that the patch
corresponds to the ``bright spot'' where the stream of returning debris impacts
the torus. Interestingly, although the peak luminosity of the flare was highly
sub-Eddington, the peak flux from the bright spot was close to the Eddington
limit. We speculate on the implications of this result for observations of
other flare events.

atomic and molecular sections in the Ursa Major cirrus. These images are
compared with Hi, CO and IRAS observations. In such a cloud transparent to
stellar light (Av < 0.5) the mid-infrared to 100 microns and the mid-IR
emissivity per hydrogen are related to the abundance and the optical properties
of small dust particles independently of any modelling of the penetration of
the radiation. Within the atomic section of the cloud, the comparison between
ISOCAM images and 21 cm interferometric data highlights an enhancement of the
mid-IR emitters abundance by a factor ~5 in an Hi filament characterized by a
large transverse velocity gradient suggestive of rotation. Furthermore, a drop
in the abundance of the same mid-IR emitters is observed at the interface
between the atomic and molecular cirrus sections. We propose that these
abundance variations of the mid-IR emitters are related to the production of
small dust particles by grain shattering in energetic grain-grain collisions
generated by turbulent motions within the cirrus and inversely by their
disappearance due to coagulation on large grains. At the atomic-molecular

conclude that the P inventory was established in the epoch prior to z=4.6. The
dispersal of processed baryonic matter to the general IGM is considered to be

Clouds are detected by their HI LyA absorption lines in the HST spectra of

characterized is the tidal field, which places a lower limit on the cloud
mass-density which is dynamically stable against disruption. Galaxy redshift
catalogs are used to sum the tidal fields along the lines of sight, sorting
clouds according to tidal field upper, or lower limits. The analytical
methodology employed is designed to detect gas clouds whose expansion following
reionization is restrained by dark matter perturbations. End-products are the
cloud equivalent width distribution functions (EWDF) of catalogs formed by
sorting clouds according to various tidal field upper, or lower limits.
  Cumulative EWDFs are steep in voids (S ~ -1.5 \pm 0.2), but flatter in high
tidal field zones (S ~ -0.5 \pm 0.1). Most probable cloud Doppler parameters
are ~30 km/s in voids and ~60 km/s in proximity to galaxies. In voids, the
cumulative line density at low EW (~ 15 mA) is ~ 500 per unit redshift. The
void filling factor is found to be 0.87 <= f_v <= 0.94. The void EWDF is
remarkably uniform over this volume, with a possible tendency for more massive
clouds to be in void centers. The size and nature of the void cloud population
suggested by this study is completely unanticipated by the results of published
3-D simulations, which predict that most clouds are in filamentary structures

sigma in nearby elliptical galaxies affords a novel way to determine M(BH) in
active galaxies. We report on measurements of sigma from optical spectra of 7
BL Lac host galaxies. The derived values of sigma are in the range of 160 - 290
km/s corresponding to M(BH) of 5 x 10^7 to 1 x 10^9 Msun. The average ratio of
M(BH) to the host galaxy mass is 1.4 x 10^-3, consistent with that estimated in
other active and inactive galaxies. The velocity dispersions and the derived
values of M(BH) of the BL Lacs are similar to those obtained for low redshift
radio galaxies, in good agreement with the predictions of the unified models
for radio-loud active galaxies.

Sequences that are random (in the sense of Martin-Lof) have dimension 1, while
sequences that are decidable, \Sigma^0_1, or \Pi^0_1 have dimension 0. It is
shown that for every \Delta^0_2-computable real number \alpha in [0,1] there is
a \Delta^0_2 sequence S such that \dim(S) = \alpha.
  A discrete version of constructive dimension is also developed using
termgales, which are supergale-like functions that bet on the terminations of
(finite, binary) strings as well as on their successive bits. This discrete
dimension is used to assign each individual string w a dimension, which is a
nonnegative real number dim(w). The dimension of a sequence is shown to be the
limit infimum of the dimensions of its prefixes.
  The Kolmogorov complexity of a string is proven to be the product of its
length and its dimension. This gives a new characterization of algorithmic

dimension of a sequence is the limit infimum of the average Kolmogorov
complexity of its first n bits.

Hubble scale H during inflation to the energy scale M of the short distance

is the {\it classical background} of the inflaton field. Therefore, the
imprints of short distance physics on the spectrum of Cosmic Microwave
Background anisotropies generically involve a {\it double expansion}. We
present some examples of a single scalar field with higher order kinetic terms
coupled to Einstein gravity, and illustrate that the effects of short distance

component of the nuclear wave function. The nuclear effects due to modification
of the bound nucleon structure, soft nucleon-nucleon reinteraction in the
initial and final states of the reaction with and without color coherence have
been considered. The calculations including these nuclear effects show that the
distribution of the bound proton light-cone momentum fraction $(\alpha)$ shifts
towards small values ($\alpha < 1$), effect which was previously derived only
within plane wave impulse approximation. This shift is very sensitive to the
strength of the short range correlations in nuclei. Also calculated is an
excess of the total longitudinal momentum of outgoing protons. The calculations
are compared with data on the $C(p,2p)X$ reaction obtained from the EVA/AGS
experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory. These data show $\alpha$-shift in

the work function with oxygen pressure and temperature are explained by a
chemical equilibrium model.

into the understanding of the evolution of prices, indices and rates in the
financial markets. In this paper we perform a time series analysis of the model
employing tools from statistics, dynamical systems theory and stochastic
processes. Using benchmark systems and a financial index for comparison,
several conclusions are obtained about the generating mechanism for this kind
of evolut ion. The motion is deterministic, driven by occasional random
external perturbation. When the interval between two successive perturbations
is sufficiently large, one can find low dimensional chaos in this regime.
However, the full motion of the MG model is found to be similar to that of the
first differences of the SP500 index: stochastic, nonlinear and (unit root)
stationary.

Nutation Echo (SNE) in a two-level spin system. This is the signal which
appears in the transient response of the system to the second pulse at time
tau_1 elapsed from its beginning and coinciding with the duration of the first
pulse. The information about the first pulse duration is imprinted into the
population difference of the inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of the
two-level absorbers. The decay of the SNE signal has two contributions. One
originates from the population decay during the time tau between the pulses.
Another is caused by the coherence loss during the excitation by the first
pulse and the reading time of the second pulse. Experimental results on the
decay properties induced by these mechanisms are presented. The dependence of
these decay rates on the pulse intensity is discussed, and its relationship
with the anomalous (non-Bloch) decay of other coherent transients in solids is
examined.

Lorentz transformations in a fully relativistic setting. By explicit
calculation of the Wigner rotation, we describe the relativistic analog of the
Bell states as viewed from two inertial frames moving with constant velocity
with respect to each other. Though the finite dimensional matrices describing
the Lorentz transformations are non-unitary, each single particle state of the
entangled pair undergoes an effective, momentum dependent, local unitary
rotation, thereby preserving the entanglement fidelity of the bipartite state.
The details of how these unitary transformations are manifested are explicitly
worked out for the Bell states comprised of massive spin 1/2 particles and
massless photon polarizations. The relevance of this work to non-inertial

self-orbiting helical solutions in a narrow neighborhood of certain discrete
values for the velocity when the electromagnetic interaction is described by
Feynman-Wheeler electrodynamics. The force rapidly oscillates between
attractive and repulsive as a function of velocity in this neighborhood. Causal
electrodynamics is also considered, and in this case it is found that when the
force is attractive the tachyon loses energy to radiation. Only certain narrow
ranges of velocity give attractive forces, and a geometrical derivation of
these special velocities is given. Possible implications of these results for
hidden variable theories of quantum mechanics are conjectured.

mechanical wave function cannot be factorized in two single-particle wave
functions. Entanglement leads to the strongest counter-intuitive feature of
quantum mechanics, namely nonlocality. Experimental realization of quantum
entanglement is relatively easy for the case of photons; a pump photon can
spontaneously split into a pair of entangled photons inside a nonlinear
crystal. In this paper we combine quantum entanglement with nanostructured
metal optics in the form of optically thick metal films perforated with a
periodic array of subwavelength holes. These arrays act as photonic crystals
that may convert entangled photons into surface-plasmon waves, i.e.,
compressive charge density waves. We address the question whether the
entanglement survives such a conversion. We find that, in principle, optical
excitation of the surface plasmon modes of a metal is a coherent process at the
single-particle level. However, the quality of the plasmon-assisted
entanglement is limited by spatial dispersion of the hole arrays. This spatial
dispersion is due to the nonlocal dielectric response of a metal, which is
particularly large in the plasmonic regime; it introduces ""which way"" labels,
that may kill entanglement.
