could comprise most of the dark matter. If so, then dark halos will emit radio
and gamma ray signals initiated by neutralino annihilation. A particularly
promising place to look for these indicators is at the center of the local
group dwarf spheroidal galaxy Draco, and recent measurements of the motion of
its stars have revealed it to be an even better target for dark matter
detection than previously thought. We compute limits on WIMP properties for
various models of Draco's dark matter halo. We find that if the halo is nearly
isothermal, as the new measurements indicate, then current gamma ray flux
limits prohibit much of the neutralino parameter space. If Draco has a moderate
magnetic field, then current radio limits can rule out more of it. These
results are appreciably stronger than other current constraints, and so
acquiring more detailed data on Draco's density profile becomes one of the most
promising avenues for identifying dark matter.

impurity or quantum dot in SiGe heterostructures is investigated. The aim is to
evaluate the importance of decoherence from this mechanism in several important
solid-state quantum computer designs operating at low temperatures. We
calculate the relaxation rate $1/T_1$ as a function of [100] uniaxial strain,
temperature, magnetic field, and silicon/germanium content for Si:P bound
electrons. The quantum dot potential is much smoother, leading to smaller
splittings of the valley degeneracies. We have estimated these splittings in
order to obtain upper bounds for the relaxation rate. In general, we find that
the relaxation rate is strongly decreased by uniaxial compressive strain in a
SiGe-Si-SiGe quantum well, making this strain an important positive design
feature. Ge in high concentrations (particularly over 85%) increases the rate,
making Si-rich materials preferable. We conclude that SiGe bound electron
qubits must meet certain conditions to minimize decoherence but that
spin-phonon relaxation does not rule out the solid-state implementation of
error-tolerant quantum computing.

liquid crystal phases in suspensions of rod-like particles. To understand such
effects, we analyse the phase behaviour of thin hard rods with length
polydispersity. Our treatment is based on a simplified Onsager theory, obtained
by truncating the series expansion of the angular dependence of the excluded
volume. We describe the model and give the full phase equilibrium equations;
these are then solved numerically using the moment free energy method which
reduces the problem from one with an infinite number of conserved densities to
one with a finite number of effective densities that are moments of the full
density distribution. The method yields exactly the onset of nematic ordering.
Beyond this, results are approximate but we show that they can be made
essentially arbitrarily precise by adding adaptively chosen extra moments,
while still avoiding the numerical complications of a direct solution of the
full phase equilibrium conditions.
  We investigate in detail the phase behaviour of systems with three different
length distributions: a (unimodal) Schulz distribution, a bidisperse
distribution and a bimodal mixture of two Schulz distributions which
interpolates between these two cases. A three-phase isotropic-nematic-nematic
coexistence region is shown to exist for the bimodal and bidisperse length
distributions if the ratio of long and short rod lengths is sufficiently large,
but not for the unimodal one. We systematically explore the topology of the
phase diagram as a function of the width of the length distribution and of the
rod length ratio in the bidisperse and bimodal cases.

of carbon atoms in the octahedral interstitial sites of the face-centered cubic
(fcc) phase of the iron-carbon system. The experimental part of the work
consists of Mossbauer measurements in Fe-C alloys with up to about 12 atomic
percent C, which are interpreted in terms of two alternative models for the
distribution of C atoms in the interstitial sites. The theoretical part
combines an analysis of the chemical potential of C based on the quasichemical
approximation to the statistical mechanics of interstitial solutions, with
three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations. The latter were performed by
assuming a gas like mixture of C atoms and vacancies (Va) in the octahedral
interstitial sites. The number of C-C, C-Va and Va-Va pairs calculated using
Monte Carlo simulations are compared with those given by the quasichemical
model. Furthermore, the relative fraction of the various Fe environments were
calculated and compared with those extracted from the Mossbauer spectra. The
simulations reproduce remarkably well the relative fractions obtained assuming
the Fe(8)C(1-y) model for Mossbauer spectra, which includes some blocking of
the nearest neighbour interstitial sites by a C atom. With the new experimental
and theoretical information obtained in the present study, a critical
discussion is reported of the extent to which such blocking effect is accounted
for in current thermodynamic models of the Fe-C fcc phase.

Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the four experiments BRAHMS, PHENIX,
PHOBOS, and STAR have been presented. In these lectures we review the state of
RHIC and the experiments and the most exciting current results from Run I which
took place in 2000. A complete review is not possible yet with many key results
still preliminary or to be measured in Run II, which is currently underway, and
thus the emphasis will be on the approach experimentalists have taken to
address the fundamental physics issues of the field. We have not attempted to
update the RHIC results for this proceedings, but rather present it as a
snapshot of what was discussed in the workshop. The field is developing very
quickly, and benefits greatly from contact and discussions between the
different approaches of experimentalists and theorists.

The Cooler Synchrotron COSY at FZ--J\""ulich is a unique environment to perform
such studies. Measurements of polarization observables require a cylindrically
symmetrical detector, capable to measure the momenta and the directions of
outgoing charged hadrons. The wide energy range of COSY leads to momenta of
outgoing protons to be detected in a single meson production reaction between
300 and 2500 MeV/c. Scattering angles of protons to be covered extend to about
$45^{\circ}$ in the laboratory system. An azimuthal angular coverage of the
device around 98% seems technically achievable. The required magnetic
spectrometer could consist of a superconducting toroid, providing fields around
3 T.

distribution. The dependence of the transmission linewidth on the driving field
intensity is discussed and compared to the laser induced line narrowing effect.
This dependence can be characterized by a parameter which can be regarded as
``the degree of optical pumping''.

noncommutative generalization of conditional probability. This view clarifies
many problems surrounding the interpretation of quantum mechanics, particularly
problems relating to the measuring process.

pulses in a weak probe beam approximation. We show that when all lasers are
tuned to the exact unperturbed resonances, part of the four-wave mixing (FWM)
field is strongly absorbed. The part which is not absorbed has the exact
intensity required to destructively interfere with the excitation pathway
involved in producing the FWM state. We show that with this three-photon
destructive interference, the conversion efficiency can still be as high as
25%. Contrary to common belief,our calculation shows that this process, where
an ideal one-photon electromagnetically induced transparency is established, is
not most suitable for high efficiency conversion. With appropriate
phase-matching and propagation distance, and when the three-photon destructive
interference does not occur, we show that the photon flux conversion efficiency
is independent of probe intensity and can be close to 100%. In addition, we
show clearly that the conversion efficiency is not determined by the maximum
atomic coherence between two lower excited states, as commonly believed. It is
the combination of phase-matching and constructive interference involving the
two terms arising in producing the mixing wave that is the key element for the
optimized FWM generation. Indeed, in this scheme no appreciable excited state
is produced, so that the atomic coherence between states |0> and |2> is always
very small.
