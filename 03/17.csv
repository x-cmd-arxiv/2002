that should be detected by a flux limited radio survey, is calculated. It is
shown that for jetted GRBs this number is smaller for smaller jet opening angle
(theta), contrary to naive expectation. For a beaming factor
f_b^{-1}=(theta^2/2)^{-1} = 500, roughly the value inferred by Frail et al.
(2001) from analysis of afterglow light curves, we predict that between several
hundreds to several thousands orphan radio afterglows should be detectable
(over all sky) above 1 mJy at GHz frequencies at any given time. This orphan
population is dominated by sources lying at distances of a few hundred Mpc, and
having an age of ~1 yr. A search for point-like radio transients with flux
densities greater than 6 mJy was conducted using the FIRST and NVSS surveys,
yielding a list of 25 orphan candidates. We argue that most of the candidates
are unlikely to be radio supernovae. However, the possibility that they are
radio loud AGNs cannot be ruled out without further observations. Our analysis
sets an upper limit for the all sky number of radio orphans, which corresponds
to a lower limit f_b^{-1}>10 on the beaming factor. Rejection of all candidates
found in our search would imply f_b^{-1}>100. This, and the fact that some
candidates may indeed be radio afterglows, strongly motivate further
observations of these transients.

resolution ever obtained for an AGN. This spectrum reveals absorption lines
from H-like and He-like ions of N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, and S. There are also
possible absorption lines from H-like and He-like Ar and Ca. We also identify
inner-shell absorption from lower-ionization ions such as Si_VII-Si_XII and
S_XII-S_XIV. The iron absorption spectrum is very rich; L-shell lines of
Fe_XVII-Fe_XXIV are detected, strong complex of M-shell lines, and probable
resonance lines from Fe_XXV. The absorption lines are blueshifted relative to
the systemic velocity by a mean velocity of -590+-150 km/s. We resolve many of
the absorption lines, and their mean FWHM is 820+-280 km/s. We do not find
correlations between the velocity shifts or the FWHMs with the ionization
potentials of the ions. Most absorption lines show asymmetry, having more
extended blue wings than red wings. In O_VII we have resolved this asymmetry to
be from an additional absorption system at ~ -1300 km/s. The two X-ray
absorption systems are consistent in velocity shift and FWHM with the ones
identified in the UV lines of C IV, N V, and H I. Equivalent width measurements
for all lines are given and column densities are calculated for several ions.
We resolve the narrow Fe_K\alpha line at 6398.2+-3.3 eV to have a FWHM of
1720+-360 km/s, which suggests that this narrow line may be emitted from the
outer part of the broad line region or the inner part of the torus. We also
detect a `Compton shoulder' redward of the narrow Fe_K\alpha line which
indicates that it arises in cold, Compton-thick gas.

Josephson junctions in a lossless single-mode cavity for different initial
states, under conditions such that the system is at resonance. This system is
analogous to a collection of identical atoms in a cavity, which is described
under appropriate conditions by the Dicke model. We find that our system can be
well approximated by a reduced Hamiltonian consisting of two levels per
junction. The reduced Hamiltonian is similar to the Dicke Hamiltonian, but
contains an additional term resembling a dipole-dipole interaction between the
junctions. This extra term arises when states outside the degenerate group are
included via degenerate second-order (L\""{o}wdin) perturbation theory. As in
the Dicke model, we find that, when N junctions are present in the cavity, the
oscillation frequency due to the junction-cavity interaction is enhanced by
$\sqrt{N}$. The corresponding decrease in the Rabi oscillation period may cause
it to be smaller than the decoherence time due to dissipation, making these
oscillations observable. Finally, we find that the frequency enhancement
survives even if the junctions differ slightly from one another, as expected in
a realistic system.

with a universal wave function renormalization. Based on a Morita equivalence,
the large-N double scaling limit corresponds to the continuum limit of NC gauge
theory, so the observed large-N scaling demonstrates the non-perturbative
renormalizability of this NC field theory. The area law for the Wilson loops

multimode framework by including spatial coherence in atomic collective
operators and atomic storage states. We show that atomic storage states are
Dicke states with the maximum cooperation number. In some limits, a set of
multimode atomic storage states has been established in correspondence with
multimode Fock states of the electromagnetic field. This gives better
understanding of both the quantum and coherent information of optical field can
be preserved and recovered in ultracold medium. In this treatment, we discuss
in detail both the adiabatic and dynamic transfer of quantum information
between the field and the ultracold medium.

  Hartmann- Hahn transfer experiments may be useful to enhance the NMR signal
  intensity on NMR ensemble quantum computation",,,,"quant-ph",,"  It is showed on the basis of the multiple-quantum operator algebra space
formalism that ultra-broadband heteronuclear Hartmann-Hahn polarization
transfer could be achieved by the amplitude- and frequency-modulation
quasi-adiabatic excitation (90 degree) pulses, while it is usually difficult
for the adiabatic inversion pulses to achieve effectively broadband
Hartmann-Hahn transfer in a heteronuclear coupled two-spin system. The
adiabatic and quasi-adiabatic pulses have an important property that within
their activation bandwidth flip angle of the pulses is independent of the pulse
duration and the bandwidth increases as the pulse duration. This property is
importanr for construction of the heteronuclear Hartmann-Hahn transfer
sequences with the quasi-adiabatic 90 degree pulses. Theoretic analysis and
numerical simulation show that the heteronuclear Hartmann-Hahn transfer is
performed in the even-order multiple- quantum operator algebra subspace of the
two-spin system. The multiple-quantum operator algebra space formalism may give
a powerful guide to the construction of ultra- broadband heteronuclear
Hartmann-Hahn transfer sequences with the quasi-adiabatic 90 degree pulses.
