Medium (IGM) in the high-redshift Universe is compared to the results of a
large high-resolution hydro-dynamical simulation. These schemes use either an
analytical description of the dark matter distribution and the IGM or numerical
simulations of the DM distributions combined with different approximate
relations between dark matter field and the gas distribution. Schemes based on
a filtering of the dark matter distribution with a global Jeans scale result in
a rather poor description of the gas distribution. An adaptive filtering which
takes into account the density/temperature dependence of the Jeans scale is
required. A reasonable description of the gas distribution can be achieved
using a fit of the mean relation between the dark matter and gas densities in
the hydro-dynamical simulation to relate dark matter and gas distribution. In
the hydro-dynamical simulations deviations from this mean relation are
correlated with gradients in the dark matter peculiar velocity field indicative
of shocks in the gas component. A scheme which takes into account this
correlation results in a further improved gas distribution. Such adaptive
filtering schemes applied to dark matter simulations will be very well suited
for studies of statistical properties of the Lyalpha forest which investigate
the IGM and the underlying dark matter distribution and require a large dynamic
range and/or an extensive parameter study.

  Stellar Magnetospheres and Circumstellar Accretion Disks","Accepted by ApJ; 34 pages, including 12 figures and 3 tables",,"10.1086/340896",,"astro-ph",,"  We examine, parametrically, the interaction between the magnetosphere of a
rotating, young stellar object (YSO) and a circumstellar accretion disk using
2.5-D (cylindrically symmetric) numerical magnetoydrodynamic simulations. The
interaction drives a collimated outflow, and we find that the jet formation
mechanism is robust. For variations in initial disk density of a factor of 16,
variations of stellar dipole strength of a factor of 4, and for various initial
conditions with respect to the disk truncation radius and the existence of a
disk field, outflows with similar morphologies were consistently produced.
Secondly, the system is self-regulating, where the outflow properties depend
relatively weakly on the parameters above. The large scale magnetic field
structure rapidly evolves to a configuration that removes angular momentum from
the disk at a rate that depends most strongly on the field and weakly on the
rotation rate of the foot-points of the field in the disk and the mass outflow
rate. Third, the simulated jets are episodic, with the timescale of jet
outbursts identical to the timescale of magnetically induced oscillations of
the inner edge of the disk. To better understand the physics controlling these
disk oscillations, we present a semi-analytical model and confirm that the
oscillation period is set by the spin down rate of the disk inner edge.
Finally, our simulations offer strong evidence that it is indeed the
interaction of the stellar magnetosphere with the disk, rather than some
primordial field in the disk itself, that is responsible for the formation of
jets from these systems.

  Review D. Updated version; typos corrected with some revision for clarity",,,,"astro-ph gr-qc",,"  Results from general relativistic theoretical Monte Carlo computer
simulations of Compton scattering and e-e+ pair production processes in the
ergosphere of a supermassive (10^8 solar mass) rotating black hole are
presented. Particles from an accretion disk fall into the ergosphere and
scatter off particles that are in bound equatorially and nonequatorially
confined orbits. The Penrose mechanism, in general, allows rotational energy of
a Kerr black hole to be extracted by scattered particles escaping from the
ergosphere to infinity (i.e., large distances from the black hole). The results
of these model calculations show that a form of the Penrose mechanism is
capable of producing the observed high energy particles (up to of order GeV)
emitted by quasars and other active galactic nuclei (AGNs), without the
necessity of the external electromagnetic field of the accretion disk.
Importantly, these model calculations show that the Lense-Thirring effect,
i.e., the dragging of inertial frames into rotation, caused by the angular
momentum of the rotating black hole, results in a gravitomagnetic (GM) force
being exerted on the scattered escaping particles. Inside the ergosphere, where
this dragging is severe, in appears that the GM vector field lines are frame
dragged into the positive azimuthal direction, i.e., the direction of rotation
of the black hole. The resulting GM force acting on the Penrose scattered
particles produces symmetrical and asymmetrical (or one-sided) particle
emissions in the polar direction, consistent with the astrophysical jets
observed in radio strong AGNs. Note, these Penrose processes can apply to any
size rotating black hole.

  To appear in Advances in Applied Mathematics",,,,"math.PR",,"  Scaled Boolean algebras are a category of mathematical objects that arose
from attempts to understand why the conventional rules of probability should
hold when probabilities are construed, not as frequencies or proportions or the
like, but rather as degrees of belief in uncertain propositions. This paper
separates the study of these objects from that not-entirely-mathematical
problem that motivated them. That motivating problem is explicated in the first
section, and the application of scaled Boolean algebras to it is explained in
the last section. The intermediate sections deal only with the mathematics. It
is hoped that this isolation of the mathematics from the motivating problem
makes the mathematics clearer.

in detail and the relevant nuclear matrix elements for light intermediate
neutrinos in the case of the experimentally interesting A=27 system are
calculated. The nucleus is going to be used as a stopping target in the MECO
experiment at Brookhaven, one of the most sensitive probes expected to reach a
sensitivity in the branching ratio within the next few years, which will be an
improvement of three orders of magnitude. The relevant transition operators are
constructed utilizing a variety of mechanisms present in current gauge
theories, with emphasis on the intermediate neutrinos, both light and heavy,
and heavy SUSY particles. The nuclear wave functions, both for the initial
state and all excited final states are obtained in the framework of 1s-0d shell
model employing the well-known and tested Wildenthal realistic interaction. In
the case of the light intermediate neutrinos the transition rates to all
excited final states up to 25 MeV in energy are calculated. We find that the
imaginary part of the amplitude is dominant. The total rate is calculated by
summing over all these partial transition strengths. We also find that the rate
due to the real part of the amplitude is much smaller than the corresponding
quantity found previously by the closure approximation.

obtained by the WA98 collaboration, in 158 A GeV Pb+Pb collisions at CERN SPS.
It was shown, that for small thermalisation time, two loop rate contribute
substantially to high $p_T$ photons. We argue that for extremely short
thermalisation time scale, the higher loop contribution should not be
neglected. For thermalisation time 0.4 fm or greater, when higher loop
contribution are not substantial, the initial temperature of the QGP is not
large and the system does not produce enough hard $p_T$ photons to fit the WA98
experiment. For initial time in the ranges of 0.4-1.0 fm, WA98 data could be
fitted only if the fluid has initial radial velocity in the range of 0.3-0.5c.
The model was applied to predict photon spectrum at RHIC energy.
