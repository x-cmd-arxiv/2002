dynamical interaction between a relativistic jet and a stellar envelope
surrounding it. The delay in observer's time introduced by the jet traversing
the envelope should not be long compared to the duration of gamma-ray emission;
also, the jet should not be swallowed by a spherical explosion it powers. The
only stellar progenitors that comfortably satisfy these constraints, if one
assumes that jets move ballistically within their host stars, are compact
carbon-oxygen or helium post-Wolf-Rayet stars (type Ic or Ib supernovae); type
II supernovae are ruled out. Notably, very massive stars do not appear capable
of producing the observed bursts at any redshift unless the stellar envelope is
stripped prior to collapse. The presence of a dense stellar wind places an
upper limit on the Lorentz factor of the jet in the internal shock model;
however, this constraint may be evaded if the wind is swept forward by a photon
precursor. Shock breakout and cocoon blowout are considered individually;
neither presents a likely source of precursors for cosmological GRBs.
  These envelope constraints could conceivably be circumvented if jets are
laterally pressure-confined while traversing the outer stellar envelope. If so,
jets responsible for observed GRBs must either have been launched from a region
several hundred kilometers wide, or have mixed with envelope material as they
travel. A phase of pressure confinement and mixing would imprint correlations
among jets that may explain observed GRB variability-luminosity and
lag-luminosity correlations.

Interactions in the CFL phase are described by an effective low-energy theory.
For temperatures in the tens of keV range, relevant to the long-term cooling of
neutron stars, the emissivities involving Goldstone bosons dominate over those
involving quarks, because gaps in the CFL phase are $\sim 100$ MeV while the
masses of Goldstone modes are on the order of 10 MeV. For the same reason, the
specific heat of the CFL phase is also dominated by the Goldstone modes.
Notwithstanding this, both the emissivity and the specific heat from the

densities. The values of the emissivity and the specific heat imply that the
timescale for the cooling of the CFL core in isolation is $\sim 10^{26}$ y,
which makes the CFL phase invisible as the exterior layers of normal matter
surrounding the core will continue to cool through significantly more rapid

are commonly observed near Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). In the usual
theoretical picture of star formation, a jet is ejected from a magnetized
accretion disk, with a molecular outflow being driven either by the jet or by a
wider wind coming from the disk. Here, we propose an alternative global model
for the flows surrounding YSOs. In addition to a central accretion-ejection
engine driving the jet, the molecular outflow is powered by the infalling
matter and follows a circulation pattern around the central object without
necessarily being entrained by a jet. It is shown that the model produces a
heated pressure-driven outflow with magneto-centrifugal acceleration and
collimation. We report solutions for the three different parts of this
self-similar model, i.e. the jet, the infalling envelope and the circulating
matter that eventually forms the molecular outflow. This new picture of the
accretion/outflow phase provides a possible explanation for several observed
properties of YSO outflows. The most relevant ones are the presence of high
mass molecular outflows around massive protostars, and a realistic fraction
(typically 0.1) of the accretion flow that goes into the jet.

parameters of the solar oscillations as accurately as possible. Yet estimates
of the mode parameters are subject to many sources of noise, including
inevitable gaps in data, stochastic nature of excitation processes,
interferences among modes. Another uncertainty in frequency determination
results from a modulation of the oscillation frequency in itself. It is well
known that variation in the mean strength of the solar magnetic field modulates
the frequency. We consider effects of the solar magnetic field variation on the
spectral behavior of the power spectrum using a simple model. We show that the
solar magnetic field variation can cause unwanted sidelobes beside the main
peak in the power spectrum, and consequently show that the effect of the
frequency modulation due to the solar magnetic field variation can lead a bias
in frequency determinations. This effect should be considered seriously
particularly when the $ l \ne 0$ $p$-mode multiplets are analyzed to measure
the rotational splitting since the separations could be comparable. In addition
to a bias in frequency estimates, the line width is also likely to be
overestimated due to a line broadening. We therefore suggest that determination
of the mode parameters should be derived with due care considering the magnetic
field variation when a long data set is analyzed. The frequency modulation
should be taken into account in the analysis to make a solid conclusion on any
subtle dependence of the mode parameters, such as, that on the solar cycle. We
conclude by pointing out that a new method is required to accommodate the
stochastic force and the phase variation.

Here we present a detailed description of a new numerical code for treating the
time and energy dependent neutrino transport in hydrodynamical simulations of
such events. The code is based on a variable Eddington factor method to deal
with the integro-differential character of the Boltzmann equation. The moments
of the neutrino distribution function and the energy and lepton number exchange
with the stellar medium are determined by iteratively solving the zeroth and
first order moment equations in combination with a model Boltzmann equation.
The latter is discretized on a grid of tangent rays. The integration of the
transport equations and the neutrino source terms is performed in a
time-implicit way. In the present version of the program, the transport part is
coupled to an explicit hydrodynamics code which follows the evolution of the
stellar plasma by a finite-volume method with piecewise parabolic
interpolation, using a Riemann solver for calculating the hydrodynamic states.
The neutrino source terms are implemented in an operator-split step. Neutrino
transport and hydrodynamics can be calculated with different spatial grids and
different time steppings. The structure of the described code is modular and
offers a high degree of flexibility for an application to relativistic and
multi-dimensional problems at different levels of refinement and accuracy. We
critically evaluate results for a number of test cases, including neutrino
transport in rapidly moving stellar media and approximate relativistic core
collapse, and suggest a path for generalizing the code to be used in
multi-dimensional simulations of convection in neutron stars and supernovae.

fragile 7Li isotope occurs in a larger mass range ~ 1.3-0.9 M_sun. At high
metallicities typical of planet host stars, the ranges of masses are slightly
reduced essentially due to the thicker convective zones. Further reduction is
expected if non-standard processes cause extra-mixing of material below the
base of the convective zone, but even in this case there are stellar masses
where both isotopes are significantly preserved. We conclude that there is a
range of stellar effective temperature where migration and accretion of planets
and planetary material can be empirically tested using high-resolution
spectroscopy of the lithium isotopes.

the spin history and the measure of the spin-down rate is of extreme importance
in discriminating between the possible mechanisms suggested for the nature of
the X-ray emission. The value of \dot P, here measured for the first time, is
\approx 10^{-14} s/s. This value can not be explained in terms of torque from a
fossil disk. When interpreted in terms of dipolar losses, it gives a magnetic
field of B \approx 10^{13} G, making also implausible that the source is
accreting from the underdense surroundings. On the other hand, we also find
unlikely that the field decayed from a much larger value (B\approx 10^{15} G,
as expected for a magnetar powered by dissipation of a superstrong field) since
this scenario predicts a source age of \approx 10^4 yrs, too young to match the

change in symmetry is observed, as some of the symmetries exhibited are said to
be spontaneously broken. The superconducting phase transition in the underdoped
high-Tc superconductors is rather unusual, in that it is not a mean-field
transition as other superconducting transitions are. Instead, it is observed
that a pseudo-gap in the electronic excitation spectrum appears at temperatures
T* higher than Tc, while phase coherence, and superconductivity, are
established at Tc (Refs. 1, 2). One would then wish to understand if T* is just
a crossover, controlled by fluctuations in order which will set in at the lower
Tc (Refs. 3, 4), or whether some symmetry is spontaneously broken at T* (Refs.
5-10). Here, using angle-resolved photoemission with circularly polarized
light, we find that, in the pseudogap state, left-circularly polarized photons
give a different photocurrent than right-circularly polarized photons, and
therefore the state below T* is rather unusual, in that it breaks time reversal
symmetry11. This observation of a phase transition at T* provides the answer to
a major mystery of the phase diagram of the cuprates. The appearance of the
anomalies below T* must be related to the order parameter that sets in at this
characteristic temperature .

B",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.67.024513",,"cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.str-el",,"  The pairing of charge carriers with large pair momentum is considered in
connection with high-temperature superconductivity of cuprate compounds. The
possibility of pairing arises due to some essential features of
quasi-two-dimensional electronic structure of cuprates: (i) The Fermi contour
with strong nesting features; (ii) The presence of extended saddle point near
the Fermi level; (iii) The existence of some ordered state (for example,
antiferromagnetic) close to the superconducting one as a reason for an
appearing of ""pair"" Fermi contour resulting from carrier redistribution in
momentum space. In an extended vicinity of the saddle point, momentum space has
hyperbolic (pseudoeuclidean) metrics, therefore, the principal values of
two-dimensional reciprocal reduced effective mass tensor have unlike signs.
Rearrangement of holes in momentum space results in a rise of ""pair"" Fermi
contour which may be defined as zero-energy line for relative motion of the
pair. The superconducting gap arises just on this line. Pair Fermi contour
formation inside the region of momentum space with hyperbolic metrics results
in not only superconducting pairing but in a rise of quasi-stationary state in
the relative motion of the pair. Such a state has rather small decay and may be
related to the pseudogap regime of underdoped cuprates. It is concluded that
the pairing in cuprates may be due to screened Coulomb repulsion. In this case,
the superconducting energy gap in hole-doped cuprates exists in the region of
hole concentration which is bounded both above and below. The superconducting
state with positive condensation energy exists in more narrow range of doping
level inside this region. Such hole concentration dependence correlates with
typical phase diagram of cuprates.

description of the induced moment and the resulting Kondo effect is obtained in
the framework of bond-operator theory of microscopic t-J-V Hamiltonian. The
local density of state near impurities is computed in a self-consistent
Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory which shows a low-energy peak in the middle of
superconducting gap. Our theory also suggests that the charge order can be
enhanced near impuries.

is discussed. The conductivity of quantized metal films is analyzed for
different types of experimentally identified correlation functions of surface
inhomogeneities including the Gaussian, exponential, power-law correlators, and
the correlators with a power law decay of the power density spectral function.
The dependence of the conductivity $\sigma$ on the film thickness L,
correlation radius of inhomogeneities R, and the fermion density is
investigated. The goal is to help in extracting surface parameters from
transport measurements and to determine the importance of the choice of the
proper surface correlator for transport theory. A new type of size effect is
predicted for quantized films with large correlation radius of random surface
corrugation. The effect exists for inhomogeneities with Gaussian and
exponential power spectrum; if the decay of power spectrum is slow, the films
exhibit usual quantum size effect. The conductivity $% \sigma$ exhibits
well-pronounced oscillations as a function of the channel width L or the
density of fermions, and large steps as a function of the correlation radius R.
These oscillations and steps are explained and their positions identified. This
phenomenon, which is reminiscent of magnetic breakthrough, can allow direct
observation of the quantum size effect in conductivity of nano-scale metal
films. The only region with a nearly universal behavior of transport is the
region in which particle wavelength is close to the correlation radius of
surface inhomogeneities.

Temperley (FKT) in 1961. An outstanding related and yet unsolved problem is the
enumeration of dimers on a net with vacant sites. Here we consider this
vacant-site problem with a single vacancy occurring at certain specific sites
on the boundary of a simple-quartic net. First, using a bijection between dimer
and spanning tree configurations due to Temperley, Kenyon, Propp, and Wilson,
we establish that the dimer generating function is independent of the location
of the vacancy, and deduce a closed-form expression for the generating
function. We next carry out finite-size analyses of this solution as well as
that of the FKT solution. Our analyses lead to a logarithmic correction term in
the large-size expansion for the vacancy problem with free boundary conditions.
A concrete example exhibiting this difference is given. We also find the
central charge c=-2 in the language of conformal field theory for the vacancy
problem, as versus the value c=1 when there is no vacancy.

in a 30nm GaAs quantum well. The hole density is in the range
(4.6-18.9)*10^9cm^-2 and exhibits an apparent metal-to-insulator transition
(MIT) with a critical density 6*10^9 cm^-2. In the limit of zero heating power
density P, the GaAs lattice is within 2 mK of the 6 mK base temperature of our
dilution refrigerator determined by He-3 melting curve thermometry. Throughout
the range of heating power densities used (1 to 10^6 fW/cm^2), the temperature
rise of the lattice is estimated to be negligible compared to the temperature
rise of the hole gas. We argue that the hole scattering rate is only a function
of the hole temperature, with little dependence on the lattice or impurity
temperatures in the relevant temperature range below 150 mK. We have therefore
made measurements of the hole resistivity at negligible heating power density
(P<5fW/cm^2) as a function of measured lattice temperature in the range 6 to
150 mK. We then use the hole resistivity measured in a cold lattice to estimate
the temperature of the 2D hole gas as a function of P. In the low hole density
insulating phase, the heating power density P(T) that heats the hole gas to a
temperature T exhibits a dependence P ~ T^2 for T<30mK, gradually changing to P
~ T^4 for higher temperatures. On the metallic side of the MIT, P is
proportional to T^5 or T^6 with a magnitude roughly 4 times less than the power
density required to heat the insulating phase to the same temperature. Our
measurements are within a factor of two of the available quantitative
theoretical predictions for the hole energy loss rate as a function of

(How) can agents benefit from mutual interaction during the learning process?.
This paper describes the study of an interactive advice-exchange mechanism as a
possible way to improve agents' learning performance. The advice-exchange
technique, discussed here, uses supervised learning (backpropagation), where
reinforcement is not directly coming from the environment but is based on
advice given by peers with better performance score (higher confidence), to
enhance the performance of a heterogeneous group of Learning Agents (LAs). The
LAs are facing similar problems, in an environment where only reinforcement
information is available. Each LA applies a different, well known, learning
technique: Random Walk (hill-climbing), Simulated Annealing, Evolutionary
Algorithms and Q-Learning. The problem used for evaluation is a simplified
traffic-control simulation. Initial results indicate that advice-exchange can
improve learning speed, although bad advice and/or blind reliance can disturb
the learning performance.

the Batalin- Fradkin-Vilkovisky approach to quantization of constrained
systems, is derived from first principles. The derivation turns out to be
rather different from that of physical fermions since the definition of Dirac
states for ghost fermions is subtle. With these results at hand, it is then
shown that the nonminimal extension of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin operator
must be chosen differently from the notorious choice made in the literature in
order to avoid the boundary terms that have always plagued earlier treatments.
Furthermore it is pointed out that the elimination of states with nonzero ghost
number requires the introduction of a thermodynamic potential for ghosts; the
reason is that Schwarz's Lefschetz formula for the partition function of the
time- evolution operator is not capable, despite claims to the contrary, to get
rid of nonzero ghost number states on its own. Finally, we comment on the
problems of global topological nature that one faces in the attempt to obtain
the solutions of the Dirac condition for physical states in a configuration
space of nontrivial geometry; such complications give rise to anomalies that do
not obey the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions.

leading-order hbar contribution to the density of states is considered.
Therefore, by construction, the eigenvalues following from semiclassical trace
formulae generally agree with the exact quantum ones only to lowest order of
hbar. In different theoretical work the trace formulae have been extended to
higher orders of hbar. The problem remains, however, how to actually calculate
eigenvalues from the extended trace formulae since, even with hbar corrections
included, the periodic orbit sums still do not converge in the physical domain.
For lowest-order semiclassical trace formulae the convergence problem can be
elegantly, and universally, circumvented by application of the technique of
harmonic inversion. In this paper we show how, for general scaling chaotic
systems, also higher-order hbar corrections to the Gutzwiller formula can be
included in the harmonic inversion scheme, and demonstrate that corrected
semiclassical eigenvalues can be calculated despite the convergence problem.
The method is applied to the open three-disk scattering system, as a prototype
of a chaotic system.

(www.arXiv.org/pdf/nlin.AO/0109025) general organizing principles of emergent
structures in social systems are being discussed with a view to the meaning of
decentralization. It is proposed to introduce decentralization as a principle
for organizing emergent structures in a generic way utilizing aspects of the
insight gained by the Santa Fe school dealing with self-organized criticality.
The techniques utilized come from graph theory, category theory, and in
particular quantum gravity, which bear a strong potential for a multitude of
applications in research fields with a significant interdisciplinary scope.
This is especially important for applications in the organization of social
systems which usually call for an interaction of logic and hermeneutic.

  Nambu--Jona-Lasinio Model","20 pages, RevTex4, 13 figures",,,,"nucl-th hep-ph",,"  The Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model has been extensively studied by many
researchers. In previous work we have generalized the NJL model to include a
covariant model of confinement. In the present work we consider further
modification of the model so as to reproduce the type of Euclidean-space
momentum- dependent quark mass values obtained in lattice simulations of QCD.
This may be done by introducing a nonlocal interaction, while preserving the
chiral symmetry of the Lagrangian. In other work on nonlocal models, by other
researchers, the momentum dependence of the quark self-energy is directly
related to the regularization scheme. In contrast, in our work, the
regularization is independent of the nonlocality we introduce. It is of
interest to note that the value of the condensate ratio,
$<\bar{s}s>/<\bar{u}d>$, is about 1.7 when evaluated using chiral perturbation
theory and is only about 1.1 in standard applications of the NJL model. We find
that our nonlocal model can reproduce the larger value of the condensate ratio
when reasonable values are used for the strength of the 't Hooft interaction.
(In an earlier study of the $\eta$(547) and $\eta$'(958) mesons, we found that
use of the larger value of the condensate ratio led to a very good fit to the
mixing angles and decay constants of these mesons.) We also study the density
dependence of both the quark condensate and the momentum-dependent quark mass
values. Without the addition of new parameters, we reproduce the density
dependence of the condensate given by a well-known model- independent
expression valid for small baryon density.

protein functions. We study the statistical geometry of voids in
two-dimensional lattice chain polymers. We define voids as topological features
and develop a simple algorithm for their detection. For short chains, void
geometry is examined by enumerating all conformations. For long chains, the
space of void geometry is explored using sequential Monte Carlo importance
sampling and resampling techniques. We characterize the relationship of
geometric properties of voids with chain length, including probability of void
formation, expected number of voids, void size, and wall size of voids. We
formalize the concept of packing density for lattice polymers, and further
study the relationship between packing density and compactness, two parameters
frequently used to describe protein packing. We find that both fully extended
and maximally compact polymers have the highest packing density, but polymers
with intermediate compactness have low packing density. To study the
conformational entropic effects of void formation, we characterize the
conformation reduction factor of void formation and found that there are strong
end-effect. Voids are more likely to form at the chain end. The critical
exponent of end-effect is twice as large as that of self-contacting loop
formation when existence of voids is not required. We also briefly discuss the
sequential Monte Carlo sampling and resampling techniques used in this study.

A template of this event has been constructed giving the time evolution, which
is an alternating sequence of 'El Ninos' and 'La Ninas'. The duration of the
event is about 15 years unless some other event intervenes. Three such events
can explain most of the El Nino/La Nina features that have been observed since
1968. We find that the various El Nino/La Nina features that have been observed
fall into types, associated with the oscillation in the template, which can be
classified by a ""Periodic Table"". The Earth is presently experiencing one of
these events which started in the mid 1990's and will continue for another 4-5
years. This extrapolation into the future suggests that a minor El Nino will
begin in mid 2001 and will reach a maximum about a year later. The conditions

addressing neutrino induced upgoing muon studies. Since the neutrino
oscillation probability depends on the neutrino energy, a measurement of the
muon energy adds an important piece of information concerning the neutrino
system. We show in this paper how the MACRO limited streamer tube system can be
operated in drift mode by using the TDC's included in the QTPs, an electronics
designed for magnetic monopole search. An improvement of the space resolution
is obtained, through an analysis of the multiple scattering of muon tracks as
they pass through our detector. This information can be used further to obtain
an estimate of the energy of muons crossing the detector. Here we present the
results of two dedicated tests, performed at CERN PS-T9 and SPS-X7 beam lines,
to provide a full check of the electronics and to exploit the feasibility of
such a multiple scattering analysis. We show that by using a neural network
approach, we are able to reconstruct the muon energy for $E_\mu<$40 GeV. The
test beam data provide an absolute energy calibration, which allows us to apply
this method to MACRO data.

triaxial metal clusters ${\rm Na}_{12}$ and ${\rm Na}_{16}$ and the
close-to-spherical ${{\rm Na}_9}^+$, all described in DFT with detailed ionic
background. The scissors modes built on spin-saturated ground and
spin-polarized isomeric states are analyzed in virtue of both macroscopic
collective and microscopic shell-model treatments. It is shown that the mutual
destruction of Coulomb and the exchange-correlation parts of the residual
interaction makes the collective shift small and the net effect can depend on
details of the actual excited state. The crosstalk with dipole and spin-dipole
modes is studied in detail. In particular, a strong crosstalk with spin-dipole
negative-parity mode is found in the case of spin-polarized states. Triaxiality
and ionic structure considerably complicate the scissors response, mainly at
expense of stronger fragmentation of the strength. Nevertheless, even in these
complicated cases the scissors mode is mainly determined by the global
deformation. The detailed ionic structure destroys the spherical symmetry and
can cause finite M1 response (transverse optical mode) even in clusters with
zero global deformation. But its strength turns out to be much smaller than for
the genuine scissors modes in deformed systems.

spacetime dependence of quantum phenomena is neglected. However the
transmission and processing of (quantum) information is a physical process in
spacetime. Therefore such basic notions in quantum information theory as qubit,
channel, composite systems and entangled states should be formulated in space
and time. In particlular we suggest that instead of a two level system (qubit)
the basic notion in a relativistic quantum information theory should be a
notion of an elementary quantum system, i.e. an infinite dimensional Hilbert
space $H$ invariant under an irreducible representation of the Poincare group
labeled by $[m,s]$ where $m\geq 0$ is mass and $s=0,1/2,1,...$ is spin. We
emphasize an importance of consideration of quantum information theory from the
point of view of quantum field theory. We point out and discuss a fundamental
fact that in quantum field theory there is a statistical dependence between two
regions in spacetime even if they are spacelike separated. A classical
probabilistic representation for a family of correlation functions in quantum
field theory is obtained. Entangled states in space and time are considered. It
is shown that any reasonable state in relativistic quantum field theory becomes
disentangled (factorizable) at large spacelike distances if one makes local
observations. As a result a violation of Bell`s inequalities can be observed
without inconsistency with principles of relativistic quantum theory only if
the distance between detectors is rather small. We suggest a further
experimental study of entangled states in spacetime by studying the dependence
of the correlation functions on the distance between detectors.

quantum coherence. The coherence here is determined by the relative phase
inside a state. Unfortunately, so far all the relevant experimental results in
quantum optics are insensitive to the phase information of the coherent state.
Lack of phase information may cause serious consequences in many problems in
quantum optics. For example, an ensemble of two mode squeezed states is a
classical ensemble if the phase in each state is totally random; but it is a
non-classical ensemble if the phase in each state is fixed. As a timly
application, verification of this type of phase information in an ensemble of
two mode squeezed states from the conventional laser is crucial to the validity
of the continuous variavable quantum teleportation(CVQT) experiment. Here we
give a simple scheme to distinguish two different ensemble of states: the
Rudolph-Sanders ensemble, by which each squeezed states emitted has a uniform
distribution from $0-2\pi$ on the phase value; and the van Enk-Fuchs ensemble,
which emmits identical states with a fixed(but unknown) phase for every state.
We believe our proposal can help to give a clear picture on whether the
existing two mode squeezed states so far are indeed non-classical states which
can be used as the entanglement resource.
