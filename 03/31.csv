2002ap are presented, and the properties of the SN are investigated through
models of its spectral evolution and its light curve. The SN is
spectroscopically similar to the ""hypernova"" SN 1997ef. However, its kinetic
energy [$\sim (4-10) \times 10^{51}$ erg] and the mass ejected (2.5-5
$M_{\odot}$) are smaller, resulting in a faster-evolving light curve. The SN
synthesized $\sim 0.07 M_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni, and its peak luminosity was
similar to that of normal SNe. Brightness alone should not be used to define a
hypernova, whose defining character, namely very broad spectral features, is
the result of a high kinetic energy. The likely main-sequence mass of the
progenitor star was 20-25 $M_{\odot}$, which is also lower than that of both
hypernovae SNe 1997ef and 1998bw. SN 2002ap appears to lie at the low-energy
and low-mass end of the hypernova sequence as it is known so far. Observations
of the nebular spectrum, which is expected to dominate by summer 2002, are
necessary to confirm these values.

similar to the so-called ``hypernovae'' 1997ef and 1998bw, both possibly
associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), it is of great interest. Shortly after
its discovery, we launched an intensive photometric and spectroscopic
monitoring campaign of this event, and here we report the results of the first
month of observations. We use our UBVRI photometry to estimate the magnitudes
at, and dates of, peak brightness. Our data suggest that this object reached
its peak B-band luminosity on Feb. 7.1(-1.3)(+2) UT. Based on its similarity to
SN 1998bw, we estimate the range of possible dates for a GRB that may have been
associated with SN 2002ap. We find that it may include dates outside the time
frame for which all available gamma-ray data have been intensively scanned,
according to recent reports. The absolute magnitude at peak brightness of SN
2002ap (M_B = -16.9) shows that it was significantly fainter than SN 1998bw, or
normal type-Ia SNe, but similar to SN 1997ef. Our spectroscopic observations
confirm that SN 2002ap is strikingly similar to SNe 1998bw and 1997ef. We
briefly describe the spectral evolution of this object. To assist other
observers and to stimulate theoretical models, we make our entire data set
publicly available in digital form.

$B$-magnitude from $M_B=-29$ mag to -18 mag. Among low-$z$ AGNs with $z<0.3$,
Seyfert $1-1.5$ AGNs are distributed over a region from a location typical of
``galaxies'' to a location typical of ``QSOs'' in the two-color $J-H$ to $H-K'$

``galaxies''. Moreover, bright AGNs with respect to absolute $B$-magnitude are
distributed near the location of ``QSOs'', while faint AGNs are near the
location of ``galaxies''. The distribution of such low-$z$ AGNs in this diagram
was found to have little dependence on their 6 cm radio flux. The near-infrared
colors of the AGNs observed with an aperture of 7 pixels ($7.49''$) are more
QSO-like than those observed with larger apertures up to 15 pixels ($16.1''$).
This aperture effect may be explained by contamination from the light of host
galaxies within larger apertures. This effect is more prominent for less
luminous AGNs.

presented along with the analysis of the observations for variability. Our
sample consists mainly of Seyfert 1 AGNs and QSOs. About a quarter of the
objects in each category are radio loud. The AGNs in the entire sample have the
redshifts spanning the range from $z=0$ to 1, and the absolute magnitudes from
$M_B=-29$ to -18. All the objects were observed twice and their variability was
measured by differential photometry.
  A reduction method of differential photometry, optimized to the analysis of
extended images, has been developed. The systematic error in variability
arising from AGNs of highly extended images is estimated to be less than 0.01
mag in each of the $J$, $H$, and $K'$ bands. The systematic error arising from
the flat fielding is negligible for most AGNs, although it is more than 0.1 mag
for some particular cases. The overall average flat fielding error is 0.03 mag
for the image pairs. We find that these systematic errors are superseded by
statistical errors, and the overall average total systematic and statistical
errors amounts to 0.05 mag in the measured variability in each band.
  We find that 58% of all the AGNs in the entire sample show variability of
more than $2\sigma$, and 44% of more than $3\sigma$. This result holds
independent of the $J$, $H$, and $K'$ bands. The detection rate of variability
is higher for a subsample of higher photometric accuracy, and there appears no
limit to this tendency. In particular, when we consider a subsample with small
photometric errors of $\sigma<0.03$ mag, the rate of $2\sigma$ detection is
80%, and 64% for $3\sigma$ detection. This suggests that most AGNs are variable
in the near-infrared.

analyzed and discussed. An ensemble average for measured variabilities was
obtained for various samples of the AGNs divided by absolute $B$-magnitude
$M_B$, redshift $z$, and radio strength. All the samples in the $J$, $H$, and
$K'$ bands are found to give significant ensemble variability, but no
significant wavelength dependence is found. The ensemble variability in the
entire sample combining the $J$, $H$, and $K'$ samples is $\Delta m\approx
0.22$ mag, while $\Delta m\approx 0.18$ mag for the radio-quiet AGNs and
$\Delta m\approx 0.26$ mag for radio-loud AGNs. The ensemble variability for
the radio-quiet AGNs shows no significant $M_B$-dependence, while showing
positive $M_B$-dependence for the radio-loud AGNs. In any samples the measured
variability shows positive correlation among different passbands, with the
correlation coefficients of $r_{JH}$, $r_{HK'}$, and $r_{JK'}$ ranging from 0.6
to 0.9. For radio-quiet AGNs, the coefficient $r_{HK'}$ in a redshift range of
$0.1<z<0.3$ is significantly higher than $r_{JH}$ or $r_{JK'}$. The coefficient
for the radio-loud AGNs with $0.6<z<1.0$ is as high as 0.95, irrespective of
the passband. However, for the radio-quiet AGNs with $z>0.3$ and radio-loud
AGNs with $z<0.3$, we cannot confirm such strong correlation among different
passbands. All the features of near-infrared variability for the radio-quiet
AGNs are consistent with a simple dust reverberation model of the central
regions of AGNs. However, the features for the radio-loud AGNs are not fully
explained by such a model, and a non-thermal variable component is suggested as
a viable candidate for causing their large and fast variability in the
near-infrared region.

vanishes because of time-reversal invariance is invalidated by the path-ordered
exponential of the gluon field in the operator definition of parton densities.
Instead, the time-reversal argument shows that the Sivers asymmetry is reversed
in sign in hadron-induced hard processes (e.g., Drell-Yan), thereby violating
naive universality of parton densities. Previous phenomenology with
time-reversal-odd parton densities is therefore validated.

be done in $n \choose k$ ways). In this article I sketch the beginnings of a
theory that would import these notions into the category of hedral sets in the
sense of Morelli and the category of polyhedral sets in the sense of Schanuel.
Both of these theories can be viewed as extensions of the theory of finite sets
and mappings between finite sets, with the concept of cardinality being
replaced by the more general notion of Euler measure (sometimes called
combinatorial Euler characteristic). I prove a ``functoriality'' theorem
(Theorem 1) for subset-selection in the context of polyhedral sets, which
provides quasi-combinatorial interpretations of assertions such as $2^{-1} =
\frac12$ and ${1/2 \choose 2} = -\frac18$. Furthermore, the operation of
forming a power set can be viewed as a special case of the operation of forming
the set of all mappings from one set to another; I conclude the article with a
polyhedral analogue of the set of all mappings between two finite sets, and a
restrictive but suggestive result (Theorem 2) that offers a hint of what a
general theory of exponentiation in the polyhedral category might look like.

1997. Its definition consists of five axioms and an assumption for a
derivation. It is shown that two of the axioms and the assumption for the
derivation follow from the rest of the axioms.

(14.6 A-GeV Si+Al, Si+Au, and 11.6 A-GeV Au+Au), seven distinct centrality
conditions, and different kT bins in the range 0.1--0.5 GeV/c. Source reference
frames are determined from fits to the Yano-Koonin source parameterization.
Bertsch-Pratt radius parameters are shown to scale linearly with both number of
projectile and total participants as obtained from a Glauber model calculation.
A finite emission duration that increases linearly with system/centrality is
also reported. The mT dependence of the Bertsch-Pratt radii is measured for the
central Si+Au and Au+Au systems. The system/centrality dependence is
investigated separately for both high and low mT regions.
