collapses have addressed important issues on the dynamical/structural
characteristics of collapsed equilibrium systems. However, the study of
collisionless collapse in the context of the nature of the FP has not been
satisfactorily addressed yet. Our aim in this paper is to focus our attention
on the resulting collapse of simple one-component spherical models with a range
of different initial virial coefficients. We find that the characteristic
correlations of the models are compatible with virialized, centrally homologous
systems. Our results strengthen the idea that merging may be a fundamental
ingredient in forming non-homologous objects.

This is probably the result of an acceleration obtained during the supernova

Large Magellanic Cloud combine stellar surface areas (in absolute units)
determined from photometric light and radial velocity curves with surface
brightnesses from model atmospheres and observed spectra. The method does not
require the stars to be normal or undistorted, and is not limited in its
applicability to the well detached systems that have traditionally been
considered. With this in mind we carry out semi-detached light curve solutions
for SMC binaries discovered by the OGLE collaboration, identify candidates for
distance estimation, and tabulate OGLE light curve solutions. We point out
important advantages for semi-detached binaries as standard candles; (1) light
curve solutions can be strengthened by exploiting lobe-filling configurations,
(2) only single-lined spectra may be needed because the mass ratio can often be
determined from photometry, and (3) nearly all semi-detached binaries have
sensibly circular orbits. We carry out simulations with synthetic data to show
that semi-detached binaries can often be reliably identified and to quantify
the accuracy of solutions. The simulations demonstrate two additional
advantages for semi-detached distance determination candidates; (4) the
well-known difficulty in distinguishing solutions with interchanged radii
(aliasing) is much less severe for semi-detached than for detached binaries,
and (5) the desirable condition of complete eclipse is identified with improved
reliability. In many cases we find that detached and semi-detached systems can
be distinguished, and we select 36 candidate semi-detached systems from the

events are expected to arise both from extreme-separation (either very close or
very wide), roughly equal-mass binary lenses, and from planetary systems. We
show that the lens of MACHO 99-BLG-47 is in fact an extreme-separation binary,
not a planetary system, thus demonstrating for the first time that these two
important classes of events can be distinguished in practice. However, we find
that the wide-binary and close-binary lens solutions fit the data equally well,

qualitatively much more severe than the one identified for MACHO 98-SMC-1

is well above the predicted Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff due to the pion
production of extragalactic cosmic ray protons off the cosmic microwave
background. In addition to the relatively high flux of events, the isotropic
distribution of arrival directions and an indication of small scale clustering
strongly challenge all models proposed to resolve this puzzle. We discuss how
the GZK cutoff is modified by the local distribution of galaxies and how
astrophysical proton sources with soft injection spectra are ruled out by AGASA
data. Sources with hard injection spectrum are barely allowed by the observed
spectrum. If the most recent claims by AGASA that the highest energy events are
due to clustered nuclei are confirmed, the most plausible explanation are
astrophysical sources with very hard spectra such as extragalactic unipolar
inductors. In addition, extragalactic magnetic fields need to be well below the
current nano-Gauss upper limits. Alternatively, if the primaries are not
nuclei, the need for new physics explanations is paramount. We present an
overview of the theoretical proposals along with their most general signatures
to be tested by upcoming experiments.

a definitive explanation for why this is so. With its excellent angular
resolution, Chandra has imaged hot X-ray-emitting gas close to the
gravitational capture radius of a handful of supermassive black holes,
including Sgr A* in the nucleus of our own Galaxy. These observations provide
direct and reliable estimates of the Bondi mass accretion rate in these nuclei.
It is found that the Bondi accretion rate is significantly below the Eddington
mass accretion rate, but this alone does not explain the dimness of the
accretion flows. In all the systems observed so far, the accretion luminosity
is orders of magnitude less than Mdot_{Bondi} times c^2, which means that the
accretion must occur via a radiatively inefficient mode. This conclusion, which
was strongly suspected for many years, is now inescapable. Furthermore, if the
accretion in these nuclei occurs via either a Bondi flow or an
advection-dominated accretion flow, the accreting plasma must be
two-temperature at small radii, and the central mass must have an event
horizon. Convection, winds and jets may play a role, but observations do not
yet permit definite conclusions.

from initial states of hydrostatic equilibrium, we follow the collapse of both
singular and nonsingular logatropic cores until the central protostar has
accreted > 90% of the total available mass. We find that, in the collapse of a
singular core with access to a finite mass reservoir, the mass of the central
protostar increases as M_acc proportional to t^4 until it has accreted about
35% of the total available mass. For nonsingular cores of fiducial masses 1,
2.5, and 5 M_solar, we find that protostellar accretion proceeds slowly prior
to the formation of a singular density profile. Immediately thereafter, the
accretion rate in each case increases to about 10^{-6} M_solar/yr, for cores
with central temperature T_c= 10 K and truncation pressure P_s = 1.3E5 k_B
K/cm^3. It remains at that level until half the available mass has been
accreted. After this point, the accretion rate falls steadily as the remaining

stages of its evolution emits a wavetrain at specific frequencies that depend
on the characteristics of the obital motion; as the orbit shrinks and
circularize, due to radiation reaction effects, the orbiting bodies get closer
and tidally interact. This interaction may result in the excitation of the
proper modes of oscillation of the stars, and in the emission of gravitational
signals that carry information on the mode frequencies, and consequently on the

contribution to the free energy similar to that condiered by Nozi'eres and
Schmitt-Rink, the character of the superfluid phase transition continuously
changes from the BCS-type to the BEC-type, as the threshold of the

stable long-lived composite Bosons, and an effective pairing interaction
mediated by the molecules causes pre-formed Cooper-pairs to also be stable even

by surfactant micelles. Such systems were recently studied by Atomic Force
Microscopy [M. Chakrapani et al., e-print cond-mat/0112255]. The gel is
represented by a frustrated, triangular network of nodes connected by springs
of random equilibrium lengths. The nodes represent crosslinkers, and the
springs correspond to polymer chains. The boundaries are fixed at the bottom,
free at the top, and periodic in the lateral direction. Voids are introduced by
deleting a proportion of the nodes and their associated springs. The model is
numerically relaxed to a representative local energy minimum, resulting in an
inhomogeneous, ``clumpy'' bulk structure. The free top surface is defined at
evenly spaced points in the lateral (x) direction by the height of the topmost
spring, measured from the bottom layer, h(x). Its scaling properties are
studied by calculating the root-mean-square surface width and the generalized
increment correlation functions C_q(x)= <|h(x_0+x)-h(x_0)|^q>. The surface is
found to have a nontrivial scaling behavior on small length scales, with a
crossover to scale-independent behavior on large scales. As the vacancy
concentration approaches the site-percolation limit, both the crossover length
and the saturation value of the surface width diverge in a manner that appears
to be proportional to the bulk connectivity length. This suggests that a
percolation transition in the bulk also drives a similar divergence observed in
surfactant templated polyacrylamide gels at high surfactant concentrations.

analyticity breaking transition between a sliding and pinned state. The ground
state equations coincide with the standard map in non-linear dynamics, with
smooth or chaotic orbits below and above K_c respectively. For the standard
map, Greene and MacKay have calculated the value K_c=.971635. Conversely,
evaluations based on the analyticity breaking of the modulation function have
been performed for high commensurate approximants. Here we show how the
modulation function of the infinite system can be calculated without using
approximants but by Taylor expansions of increasing order. This approach leads
to a value K_c'=.97978, implying the existence of a golden invariant circle up
to K_c' > K_c.

observer in spacetime induces a new type of connection that we call the rigged
metric connection. The generalisation of the Gauss and Codazzi equations are

spacetimes across a general hypersurface. It is seen that the preliminary
junction conditions allowing for the correct definition of Einstein's equations
in the distributional sense reduce to the requirement that the first
fundamental form of the hypersurface be continuous. The Bianchi identities are
then proven to hold in the distributional sense. Next, we find the proper
junction conditions which forbid the appearance of singular parts in the

conditions: only six independent discontinuities of the Riemann tensor are
allowed. These are six matter discontinuities at non-null points of the

is free of gravitational anomalies. Although an exponential hierarchy arises
between the neutrino masses and the electroweak scale, we find that the mass
hierarchy among the three neutrino masses is limited by higher-dimension
operators. All current neutrino oscillation data, except for the LSND result,
are naturally accommodated by our model. In the case of the solar neutrinos,
the model leads to the large mixing angle, MSW solution. The mechanism

observed CP violation agrees with the expectations of the Standard model, based
on the quark-mixing phenomenon. The first results of the Sudbury Neutrino

finally solved in terms of neutrino oscillations. Results appeared after the

string tension a' and the radius R. The standard AdS/CFT correspondence
requires that the string coordinates are rescaled so that the action depends
only on one combination of the two: (\lambda)^{1/2} = R^2/a'. Then \lambda \to
0 limit is equivalent to R \to 0 for fixed $a'$ or to the zero-tension limit in
AdS_5 x S^5: a' \to \infty for fixed R. After reviewing previous work
hep-th/0009171 on the light cone superstring we explicitly obtain the \lambda=
0 form of its action. Its zero-mode part is the same as the superparticle
action in AdS_5 x S^5, and thus the \lambda=0 string spectrum must include, as
expected, the ``protected'' type IIB supergravity states. Following recent
suggestions, it is conjectured that the spectrum of this tensionless string
should as well contain higher spin massless states in AdS_5. We also discuss
the case of another parametrization of the string action which has
straightforward R\to\infty flat space limit but where R \to 0 and a' \to \infty
limits are not equivalent. There R \to 0 corresponds to shrinking S^5 to zero
the size and ``freezing'' the fluctuations of the radial coordinate of AdS_5.
This case is the basis of the ``non-standard'' AdS/CFT correspondence suggested
in hep-th/0010106. Parts of this work were presented in the talk at

universe and other universes. The unified theory is based on the zero-energy
universe and the space-object structures. Different universes in different
developmental stages are the different expressions of the space-object
structures. The unified theory is divided into five parts: the space-object
structures, cosmology, the periodic table of elementary particles, the galaxy
formation, and the extreme force field. The space-object structures explain
quantum mechanics, relativity, and the evolution of the universes. From the
zero-energy universe, our universe starts with the 11D (dimensional) membrane
dual universe followed by the 10D string dual universe and then by the 10D
particle dual universe, and ends with the asymmetrical light-dark dual
universe. This 4-stage process goes on in repetitive cycles. Such 4-stage
cosmology accounts for the origins of the four force fields. The theoretical
calculated percentages of dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter are
72.8. 22.7, and 4.53, respectively, in agreement with observed values.
According to the calculation, dark energy started in 4.47 billion years ago in
agreement with the observed 4.71 +/- 0.98 billion years ago. The unified theory
places all elementary particles in the periodic table of elementary particles
with the calculated masses in good agreement with the observed values,
including the mass of the Higgs boson. It explains the inflation, the Big Bang,
and the formation of various shapes of galaxies. It gives the structure for the
extreme force fields, including superconductivity, black hole, and supernova.

an algebraic tool for combinatorial problems of quantum field theory. This
framework encompasses commutation relations, normal products, time-ordered

time-ordered product as deformations of the normal product. In particular, it
gives an algebraic meaning to Wick's theorem and it extends the concept of
Laplace pairing to prove that the renormalised time-ordered product is an
associative deformation of the normal product involving an infinite number of

variation in global cloud optical thickness, or opacity, with cosmic-ray rate.

and visible cloud amount due to cosmic rays. After separating out temporal
variations in the data due to the Mt. Pinatubo eruption and El Nino/Southern

due to cosmic rays increases with cloud altitude, becoming approximately zero
or negative (inverse correlation) for low clouds. Conversely, the fractional
changes in visible cloud amount due to cosmic rays are only
positively-correlated for low clouds and become negative or zero for the higher
clouds. The opacity trends suggest behavior contrary to the current predictions

domain, we obtain general expressions for superpotentials allowing generation
of quasi-exactly solvable PT-symmetric potentials with two known real
eigenvalues (the ground state and first-excited state energies). We construct
examples, namely those of complexified non-polynomial oscillators and of a
complexified hyperbolic potential, to demonstrate how our scheme works in
practice. For the former we provide a connection with the sl(2) method,
illustrating the comparative advantages of the supersymmetric one.

Lett. 89, 157902 (2002)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.157902",,"quant-ph",,"  This paper reports on the experimental implementation of the quantum baker's
map via a three bit nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum information
processor. The experiments tested the sensitivity of the quantum chaotic map to
perturbations. In the first experiment, the map was iterated forward and then
backwards to provide benchmarks for intrinsic errors and decoherence. In the
second set of experiments, the least significant qubit was perturbed in between
the iterations to test the sensitivity of the quantum chaotic map to applied
perturbations. These experiments are used to investigate previous predicted
properties of quantum chaotic dynamics.

denied. What they demonstrated was not the falsity of non-locality but the
no-superluminal-signalling principle.
