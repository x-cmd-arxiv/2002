front which is interpreted as the boundary of a cool gas cloud moving through
the hotter ambient gas. Vikhlinin et al. discussed the role of the magnetic
fields in maintaining the apparent dynamical stability of the cold front over a
wide sector at the forward edge of the moving cloud and suppressing transport
processes across the front. In this Letter, we identify two new features in the
X-ray image of A3667: i) a 300 kpc arc-like filamentary X-ray excess extending
from the cold gas cloud border into the hotter ambient gas; ii) a similar
arc-like filamentary X-ray depression that develops inside the gas cloud. The
temperature map suggests that the temperature of the filamentary excess is
consistent with that inside the gas cloud while the temperature of the
depression is consistent with that of the ambient gas. We suggest that the
observed features represent the first evidence for the development of a large
scale hydrodynamic instability in the cluster atmosphere resulting from a major
merger. This result confirms previous claims for the presence of a moving cold
gas cloud into the hotter ambient gas. Moreover it shows that, although the gas
mixing is suppressed at the leading edge of the subcluster due to its magnetic
structure, strong turbulent mixing occurs at larger angles to the direction of
motion. We show that this mixing process may favor the deposition of a
nonnegligible quantity of thermal energy right in the cluster center, affecting
the development of the central cooling flow.

the lensing boost, anywhere from ~3- 20 times, to detect dust emission from
more typical AGNs than the extremely luminous ones currently accessible without
lensing. The sources are a mix of radio loud and radio quiet quasars, and,
after correction for synchrotron radation (in the few cases where necessary),
23 of the 40 (58%) are detected in dust emission at 850um; 11 are also detected
at 450um. Dust luminosities and masses are derived after correction for lensing
magnification, and luminosities are plotted against redshift from z = 1 to z =
4.4, the redshift range of the sample. The main conclusions are (1)
Monochromatic submillimeter luminosities of quasars are, on average, only a few
times greater than those of local IRAS galaxies; (2) Radio quiet and radio loud
quasars do not differ significantly in their dust lumimosity; (3) Mean dust
luminosities of quasars and radio galaxies over the same redshift range are
comparable; (4) Quasars and radio galaxies alike show evidence for more
luminous and massive dust sources toward higher redshift, consistent with an
early epoch of formation and possibly indicating that the percentage of
obscured AGNs increases with redshift.

Myr old star TW Hya which matches the observed spectral energy distribution and
7mm images of the disk. The model requires a significant dust size evolution
and a partially-evacuated inner disk region, as predicted by theories of planet
formation. The outer disk, which extends to at least 140 AU in radius, is very
optically thick at IR wavelengths and quite massive ~0.06 Msun for the
relatively advanced age of this T Tauri star. This implies long viscous and
dust evolution timescales, although dust must have grown to sizes of order ~1cm
to explain the sub-mm and mm spectral slopes. In contrast, the negligible
near-infrared excess emission of this system requires that the disk be
optically thin inside ~4 AU.This inner region cannot be completely evacuated;
we need ~0.5 lunar mass of ~1 micron particles remaining to produce the
observed 10 micron silicate emission. Our model requires a distinct transition
in disk properties at ~4 AU, separating the inner and outer disk. The inner
edge of the optically-thick outer disk must be heated almost frontally by the
star to account for the excess flux at mid-IR wavelengths. We speculate that
this truncation of the outer disk may be the signpost of a developing gap due
to the effects of a growing protoplanet; the gap is still presumably evolving
because material still resides in it, as indicated by the silicate emission,
the molecular hydrogen emission, and by the continued accretion onto the
central star (albeit at a much lower rate than typical of younger T Tauri
stars). TW Hya thus may become the Rosetta stone for our understanding of the
evolution and dissipation of protoplanetary disks.

cumulative counts are 3.3 (1.3,6.3) 10^4 per square degree, where the upper and
lower bounds in the brackets are the 90% confidence range. The surface density
at these faint count limits enters the realm of significant overlap with other

light (EBL) residing in this flux range is about 45-65%, depending on the EBL
measurement used. Given that 20-30% of the EBL is resolved at flux densities
between 2 and 10 mJy, most of the submillimeter EBL is arising in sources above
0.3 mJy. We also performed a noise analysis to obtain an independent estimate
of the counts. The upper bounds on the counts determined from the noise
analysis closely match the upper limits obtained from the direct counts. The
differential counts from this and other surveys can reasonably be described by
the parameterization n(S)=3 10^4/(0.7 + S^3) per square degree per mJy with S
in mJy, which also integrates to match the EBL.

study the diversification of viral genomes under mutation and the selective
pressure of the immune system.In common infections vast spreading of viral
genomes usually does not takes place. In the case of an HIV infection this may
occur, as the virus successively weakens the immune system by depletion of CD4+
cells.In a sequence space framework, this leads to a dynamically induced
percolation transition, corresponding to the onset of AIDS. As a result, we
obtain the prolongated shape of the incubation period distribution, as well as
a finite fraction of non-progressors that do not develop AIDS, comparing well

intrinsic and extrinsic sources. At low temperatures and outside the region
where electron-phonon interaction occurs, the only intrinsic damping mechanism
is provided by electron-electron interaction. This kind of intrinsic damping
can be described within time-dependent density-functional theory (TDFT), but
one needs to go beyond the adiabatic approximation and include retardation
effects. It was shown previously that a density-functional response theory that
is local in space but nonlocal in time has to be constructed in terms of the
currents, rather than the density. This theory will be reviewed in the first
part of this paper. For quantitatively accurate linewidths, extrinsic
dissipation mechanisms, such as impurities or disorder, have to be included. In
the second part of this paper, we discuss how extrinsic dissipation can be
described within the memory function formalism. We first review this formalism
for homogeneous systems, and then present a synthesis of TDFT with the memory
function formalism for inhomogeneous systems, to account simultaneously for

the superconductivity of MgB2, with the objective to improve its flux pinning.
A MgB2 sample pellet that was hot isostatic pressed (HIPed) was found to have
significantly increased critical current density (Jc) at high fields than its
un-HIPed counterpart. The HIPed sample had a Jc of 10000 A/cm2 in 50000 Oe (5
T) at 5K. This was 20 times higher than that of the un-HIPed sample, and the
same as the best Jc reported by other research groups. Microstructures observed
in scanning and transmission electron microscopy indicate that the HIP process
eliminated porosity present in the MgB2 pellet resulting in an improved
intergrain connectivity. Such improvement in intergrain connectivity was
believed to prevent the steep Jc drop with magnetic field H that occurred in
the un-HIPed MgB2 pellet at H > 45000 Oe (4.5 T) and T = 5 K. The HIP process
was also found to disperse the MgO that existed at the grain boundaries of the
un-HIPed MgB2 pellet and to generate more dislocations in the HIPed the
pellets. These dispersed MgO particles and dislocations improved flux pinning
also at H<45000 Oe. The HIPing process was also found to lower the resistivity
at room temperature.

Einstein's field equations in three distinct cases. First we present the first
long-term stable second order convergent Cauchy characteristic matching code in
cylindrical symmetry including both gravitational degrees of freedom. Compared
with previous work we achieve a substantial simplification of the evolution
equations as well as the relations at the interface by factoring out the
z-Killing direction via the Geroch decomposition in both the Cauchy and the
characteristic region. In the second part we numerically solve the equations
for static and dynamic cosmic strings of infinite length coupled to gravity and
provide the first fully non-linear evolutions of cosmic strings in curved
spacetimes. The inclusion of null infinity as part of the numerical grid allows
us to apply suitable boundary conditions on the metric and the matter fields to
suppress unphysical divergent solutions. The code is used to study the
interaction between a Weber-Wheeler pulse of gravitational radiation with an
initially static string. In the final part of the thesis we probe a new
numerical approach for highly accurate evolutions of non-linear neutron star
oscillations in the case of radial oscillations of spherically symmetric stars.
For this purpose we view the evolution of the physical quantities as deviations
from a static equilibrium configuration and reformulate the equations in a
fully non-linear perturbative form. The high accuracy of the new scheme enables
us to study the non-linear coupling of eigenmodes over a wide range of initial
amplitudes.

rooted trees, graded by the count of non-root vertices. We define two linear
operators on this vector space, the growth and pruning operators, which
respectively raise and lower grading; their commutator is the operator that
multiplies a rooted tree by its number of vertices. We define an inner product
with respect to which the growth and pruning operators are adjoint, and obtain
several results about the multiplicities associated with each operator.
  The symmetric algebra on the vector space of rooted trees (after a degree
shift) can be endowed with a coproduct to make a Hopf algebra; this was defined
by Kreimer in connection with renormalization. We extend the growth and pruning
operators, as well as the inner product mentioned above, to Kreimer's Hopf
algebra. On the other hand, the vector space of rooted trees itself can be
given a noncommutative multiplication: with an appropriate coproduct, this
gives the Hopf algebra of Grossman and Larson. We show the inner product on

particular class of localized states, known as worms, that have been observed
in electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals. The worms consist of the
superposition of traveling waves and have been observed to have unique, small
widths, but to vary in length. The transition from the pure conduction state to
worms occurs via a backward bifurcation. A possible explanation of the
formation of the worms has been given in terms of coupled amplitude equations.
Because the worms consist of the superposition of traveling waves, temporal
modulation of the control parameter is a useful probe of the dynamics of the
system. We observe that temporal modulation increases the average length of the
worms and stabilizes worms below the transition point in the absence of
modulation.

large errors is much greater than expected from the Gaussian distribution. In
addition, it has been empirically found that the behavior of nonlinear complex
systems is often asymptotically exponential. Consequently, we may assume that
the error of some analytical systems may be approximated by the sum of a linear
component of error with Gaussian distribution and a nonlinear component with
Laplacian. Then, the probability density function (pdf) of the total error is
approximated by the convolution integral of the Gaussian and the Laplacian pdf.
To explore the hypothesis of a nonlinear component of the analytical error I
have evaluated this distribution and calculated various quality control related
statistics with numerical methods. Large errors are much more probable with the
proposed distribution than with the Gaussian. Simulated series of measurements
with the proposed distribution often meet the criteria for normality. The
critical errors and the probabilities for critical error detection are less
than the respective ones of the Gaussian distribution. The probabilities for
false rejection are greater. Therefore, to optimize the quality control
planning process, we should explore the possibility that there exists a
nonlinear component of the analytical error.

concept of bushes of normal modes for mechanical systems with discrete

the modal space is derived. The loss of stability of the bushes of modes for
the FPU-alfa model, in particular, for the limiting case N >> 1 for the

potential and a zero-range residual two-body interaction. The systems with two
valence neutrons are considered. The Gamow shell model, which is a
straightforward extension of the traditional shell model, is shown to be an
excellent tool for the microscopic description of weakly bound systems. It is
demonstrated that the residual interaction coupling to the particle continuum
is important; in some cases, it can give rise to the binding of a nucleus.

systems (such as gases, modelled by chaotic scattering of molecules), that are
driven into nonlocal Schr\""odinger cat -- like superpositions by the quantum
manifestations of the exponential sensitivity to perturbations$^2$. Most
importantly, these sub-Planck scales are physically significant: $a$ determines
sensitivity of a quantum system (or of a quantum environment) to perturbations.
Therefore sub-Planck $a$ controls the effectiveness of decoherence and
einselection caused by the environment$^{3-8}$. It may also be relevant in
setting limits on sensitivity of Schr\""odinger cats used as detectors.
