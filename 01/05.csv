radial-velocity variations in a component of a close binary is presented. Both
the free and the forced oscillations of the component are treated as linear,
isentropic perturbations of a spherically symmetric star. Resonances between
dynamic tides and free oscillation modes are taken into account by means of the
formalism developed by Smeyers et al. (1998). The amplitude of the tidally
induced radial-velocity variations seen by the observer depends on the orbital
eccentricity and on the orbital inclination. The amplitude increases with
increasing orbital eccentricity and is most sensitive to the value of the
orbital inclination when 20 < i < 70. In the case of a 5 solar mass ZAMS star
with a 1.4 solar mass compact companion, it is shown that resonant dynamic
tides can lead to radial-velocity variations with amplitudes large enough to be
detected in observations. The shape of the tidally induced radial-velocity
curves varies from very irregular for orbital periods away from any resonances
with free oscillation modes to sinusoidal for orbital periods close to a
resonance with a free oscillation mode. Our investigation is concluded with an
application to the slowly pulsating B star HD 177863 showing the possibility of
resonant excitation of a high-order second-degree g-mode in this star.

point source with L_x ~ 3 x 10^(38) erg/s in the 0.3--8.0 keV band is found to
coincide with the infra-red nuclear photometric peak, one of the two dynamical
nuclei of the galaxy. No point-like sources are resolved (at a 2.5-sigma level)
at the centre of symmetry of the outer optical isophote ellipses, suspected to
be another dynamical nucleus. About 50% of the total emission in the nuclear
region is unresolved; of this, about 70% can be attributed to hot thermal
plasma, and the rest is probably due to unresolved point sources (eg, faint
X-ray binaries). The azimuthally-averaged radial distribution of the unresolved
emission has a King-like profile, with no central cusp. Strong emission lines
are seen in the spectrum of the optically thin plasma component. The high
abundances of C, Ne, Mg, Si and S with respect to Fe suggest that the
interstellar medium in the nucleus is enriched and heated by type-II supernova
explosions and winds from massive stars. The cumulative luminosity distribution
of the discrete X-ray sources is neither a single nor a broken power law.
Separating the sources in the nuclear region (within a distance of 60 arcsec
from the X-ray centre) from the rest reveals that the two groups have different
luminosity distributions. The log[N(>S)]--log S curve of the sources in the
inner region (nucleus and stellar bar) is a single power law, which we
interpret as due to continuous, ongoing star formation. Outside the central
region, there is a smaller fraction of sources brighter than the Eddington

(PAH) molecules has been the recent detection of these bands in regions with
little UV illumination, since small, neutral PAH molecules have little or no
absorption at visible wavelengths and therefore require UV photons for
excitation.
  We show here that our ""astronomical"" PAH model, incorporating the
experimental result that the visual absorption edge shifts to longer wavelength
upon ionization and/or as the PAH size increases, can closely reproduce the
observed infrared emission bands of vdB 133, a UV-poor reflection nebula.
  It is also shown that single-photon heating of ``astronomical'' PAHs in
reflection nebulae near stars as cool as T_eff=3000K can result in observable
emission at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3um. Illustrative mid-IR emission spectra are
also calculated for reflection nebulae illuminated by cool stars with
T_eff=3500, 4500, 5000K. These will allow comparison with future Space Infrared

  It is also shown that the dependence of the 12um IRAS emission relative to
the total far-IR emission on the effective temperature of the exciting star is
consistent with the PAH model expectation for 3000K < T_eff < 30000K.

shorter wavelengths, and display radio outbursts over years and decades. These

intrinsic. However, this explanation implies physically difficult brightness
temperatures, suggesting that the variations may be due to scattering of the

Schottky contribution, which works as a highly-sensitive on-site probe for the

the ODS is nonmagnetic and most probably of quadrupolar origin, combined with
other experimental facts. Significantly suppressed heavy-fermion behavior in
the ODS suggests a possibility that the quadrupolar degrees of freedom is
essential for the heavy quasiparticle band formation in the HFS. Possible
crystalline-electric-field level schemes estimated from the anisotropy in the

calculated in a renormalization-scale invariant way using renormalon
resummation. Neglecting the correlation between the hemispheres in the two-jet

function, whose general properties are deduced from renormalon ambiguities.
Matching the resummed result with the available next-to-leading order
calculation, we get a good description of the thrust distribution in a wide
range, whereas the description of the heavy-jet mass distribution, which is
more sensitive to the approximation of the phase space, is restricted to the
range rho_H<1/6. This significantly limits the possibility to determine alpha_s

statistical normal distribution and is identified as a signature of
quantum-like chaos. Continuous periodogram power spectral analyses of
normalised daily, monthly and annual Dow Jones Index for the past 100-years

Index therefore exhibits self-organized criticality which is a signature of

exhibit periodicities close to model predicted values. The apparently noisy,
irregular fractal fluctuations of the Dow Jones Index contribute to the
formation of robust selfsimilar geometrical structures which indicate the
surprising resilience of market economy over a period of 100 years.
