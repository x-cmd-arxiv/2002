multifrequency data, the power spectrum of the other foreground components may
also be recovered. Advantage is taken of several characteristic properties of
interferometer data, which together allow the fast calculation of the

method is illustrated by application to simulated data from the Very Small

method, we have studied properties of the EPIC background.
  Count rates of the background vary violently by two order of magnitude at the
maximum, while during the most quiet period, these are stable within 8 % at a 1
$\sigma$ level. The overall spectrum is dominated by particle events above 5
keV, and its spatial variation is also found.
  The long-term variation of the background is also investigated with CAL
CLOSED data, which is the data of calibration source with filter closed. The
average background count rate decreased by 20 % from March 2000 to January
2001, but it regained in February 2001.
  For the modeling of the background spectrum, we investigate correlations
between the 2-10 keV count rate and some characteristic parameters. The PN
background shows a good correlation with some parameters. On the other hands,
the MOS background does not shows a clear correlation. Further investigation is
needed for the MOS background.
  Our final goal is to establish a method to predict the background, for which
these results will be reflected in the background generator.

that they would hide their stars behind a veil of dust and turn red when
forming stars, radiating the bulk of their luminosity in the infrared (IR) at a
given epoch of their history. Ten years before, IRAS had unveiled a population
of luminous IR galaxies exhibiting such a ``shy'' behavior, the so-called LIGs
and ULIGs (with 12 < log(L[IR]/Lsol < 11 and L[IR]/Lsol > 12 respectively),
which are responsible for the shape of the bolometric luminosity function of
local galaxies above ~ 10^11 Lsol. But integrated over the whole local
luminosity function, LIGs and ULIGs only produce ~ 2 % of the total integrated
luminosity and overall only ~ 30 % of the bolometric luminosity of local
galaxies is radiated in the IR above ~ 5 microns. The discovery of an
extragalactic background in the IR at least as large as the UV-optical-near IR
one, the so-called cosmic infrared background (CIRB), with the COBE satellite
implied that shyness must have been more common among galaxies in the past than
it is today. New results from the Infrared Space Observatory suggest that the
bulk of present-day stars formed at a time when their host galaxies experienced
such a phase of shyness 5 to 10 Gyr ago, i.e. between z= 0.5 and 2. The shyness

constituting one of the highest densities per unit redshift of C IV absorption
ever observed. One of the C IV systems is trough-like and resembles a weak
BAL-type outflow. Two of the C IV are ``associated'' absorption systems with
|v|<3000 km/s. Of the 11 remaining systems with v>3000 km/s, eight are either
resolved or require multiple discrete systems to fit the line profiles. In
addition to C IV absorption, there are two low-ionization Mg II absorption
systems along with two damped Ly-alpha systems, at least one of which may be a
C IV system. The overdensity of C IV absorption spans a redshift range of Delta
z=1. Superclusters along the line of sight are unlikely to cause an overdensity
stretching over such a long redshift path, thus the absorption may be an
example of narrow, high-velocity, intrinsic absorption that originates from the
quasar. We suggest that this quasar is a member of a transitional class of BAL
quasars where we are just barely seeing the spatial, density, or temporal edge
of the BAL-producing region (or period); the multiple high-velocity absorption
systems may be the remnants (or precursors) of a stronger BAL outflow. If
correct, then some simpler absorption line complexes in other quasars may also
be due to outflowing rather than intervening material.

thresholds of suitably defined clusters of spins has proved immensely fruitful
in many areas of statistical mechanics. Some time ago Kertesz suggested that
such percolation thresholds for models defined in field might also have
measurable physical consequences for regions of the phase diagram below beta_c,
giving rise to a ``Kertesz line'' running between beta_c and the bond
percolation threshold, beta_p, in the M, beta plane.
  Although no thermodynamic singularities were associated with this line it
could still be divined by looking for a change in the behaviour of high-field
series for quantities such as the free energy or magnetisation. Adler and
Stauffer did precisely this with some pre-existing series for the regular
square lattice and simple cubic lattice Ising models and did, indeed, find
evidence for such a change in high-field series around beta_p. Since there is a
general dearth of high-field series there has been no other work along these
lines.
  In this paper we use the solution of the Ising model in field on planar
random graphs by Boulatov and Kazakov to carry out a similar exercise for the
Ising model on random graphs (i.e. coupled to 2D quantum gravity). We generate
a high-field series for the Ising model on $\Phi^4$ random graphs and examine
its behaviour for evidence of a Kertesz line.

the concentration of ([Li]^{0}) centers. The conductivity is thermally
activated with an activation energy of (0.70 +/- 0.01) eV, which is independent
of the ([Li]^{0}) content. The \textit{standard semiconducting} mechanism
satisfactorily explains these results. Free holes are the main contribution to
band conduction as they are trapped at or released from the ([Li]^{0})-acceptor
centers.
  In as-grown MgO:Li crystals, electrical current increases dramatically with
time due to the formation of ([Li]^{0}) centers. The activation energy values
between 1.3 and 0.7 eV are likely a combination of the activation energy for
the creation of ([Li]^{0}) centers and the activation energy of ionization of
these centers. Destruction of ([Li]^{0}) centers can be induced in oxidized
crystals by application of an electric field due to Joule heating up to
temperatures at which ([Li]^{0}) centers are not stable.

is not a general property and therefore requires a proof because simple formal
manipulations ignore the unavoidable divergences of perturbation theory. The
existence of invariant regularizations allows solving the problem in most cases
but the combination of gauge symmetry and chiral fermions leads to subtle
issues. Depending on the specific group and field content, anomalies are found:
obstructions to the quantization of chiral gauge symmetries.Because anomalies
take the form of local polynomials in the fields, are linked to local group
transformations, but vanish for global (rigid) transformations they have a
topological character.In these notes we review various perturbative and
non-perturbative regularization techniques, and show that they leave room for
possible anomalies when both gauge fields and chiral fermions are present. We
determine the form of anomalies in simple examples. We relate anomalies to the
index of the Dirac operator in a gauge background. We exhibit gauge instantons
that contribute to the anomaly in the example of the CP(N-1) models and SU(2)
gauge theories. We briefly mentioned a few physical consequences. For many

quaternions are a fundamental language for physics is reevaluated and shown to
be essentially correct, provided one admits complex numbers in both classical
and quantum physics, and accepts carrying along the intricacies of the
relativistic formalism. Examples are shown in classical dynamics,
electrodynamics, and quantum theory. Lanczos's, Einstein's, and Petiau's
generalizations of Dirac's equation are shown to be very naturally formulated
with biquaternions. The discussion of spin, isospin, and mass quantization is
greatly facilitated. Compared with other formalisms, biquaternions have the
advantage of giving compact but at the same time explicit formulas which are
directly usable for algebraic or numerical calculations.

whose base manifold is fibred over the real numbers. It is argued that this is
the framework which one needs for coming to a time-dependent generalization of
the theory of Lagrangian systems on Lie algebroids. An extensive discussion is
given of a way one can think of forms acting on sections of the affine bundle.
It is further shown that the affine Lie algebroid structure gives rise to a
coboundary operator on such forms. The concept of admissible curves and
dynamical systems whose integral curves are admissible, brings an associated
affine bundle into the picture, on which one can define in a natural way a
prolongation of the original affine Lie algebroid structure.

  and tau functions","14 pages, 1 table. Slightly revised version that will appear in The
  Ramanujan Journal","Ramanujan J. 8 (2004), 317-330.",,,"math.NT",,"  Towards the end of his life Ramanujan wrote a manuscript on properties of the
partition and tau functions, some parts of which remained unpublished until
very recently. Nevertheless, this manuscript gave rise to a lot of subsequent
work. In it Ramanujan considers congruences for $\tau(n)$ modulo some special
primes q. He proves for example that $\tau(n)\equiv \sum_{d|n}d^{11}({\rm
mod}691)$. He defines $t_n=1$ if $\tau(n)$ is not divisible by q and $t_n=0$
otherwise. He then typically writes: ""It can be shown by transcendental methods
that $$ \sum_{k=1}^n t_k=C\int_1^n {dx\over (\log x)^{\delta}}+O({n\over (\log
n)^r}). $$ where r is any positive number"" (after stating some weaker estimates
for the above sum). The number $\delta$ is a positve rational number depending
on q and for the positive number C Ramanujan usually wrote down an Euler
product.
  In this paper it is shown that Ramanujan's claim for every $r>1+\delta$ and
each of the special primes q is false. Furthermore, we correct a 1928 paper of
Geraldine Stanley who claimed to have disproved Ramanujan's claim in case q=5.

null (isotropic) and ([\Sec N, \Sec N]\subset \Sec N). Robinson manifolds are
close analogs of the proper Riemannian, Hermite manifolds. In dimension 4, they
correspond to space-times of general relativity, foliated by a family of null
geodesics without shear. Such space-times, introduced in the 1950s by Ivor
Robinson, played an important role in the study of solutions of Einstein's
equations: plane and sphere-fronted waves, the G\""odel universe, the Kerr

the analogies between Hermite and Robinson manifolds are presented in
considerable detail.

with $\Delta$-isobar excitation of the nucleon--adjusted to reproduce the
Gamow-Teller matrix element in tritium $\beta$-decay. The measured half-life of
$^6$. He is under-predicted by theory by $\simeq$ 8%, while that of $^7$Be for
decay into the ground and first excited states of $^7$Li is over-predicted by
$\simeq$ 9%. However, the experimentally known branching ratio for these latter
processes is in good agreement with the calculated value. Two-body axial
current contributions lead to a $\simeq$ 1.7% (4.4%) increase in the value of
the Gamow-Teller matrix element of $^6$He ($^7$Be), obtained with one-body
currents only, and slightly worsen (appreciably improve) the agreement between

associated with the finite lepton momentum transfers involved in the decays, as
well as contributions of suppressed transitions induced by the weak vector
charge and axial current operators, have also been calculated and found to be
negligible.

the Mars separated from it under influence of gravitation forces about 4
billion years ago, caused by squeezing of the sun and Jupiter. In these
