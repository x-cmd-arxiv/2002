excess of unity while the disk material is characterized by H II region-like
line ratios indicative of a starburst. Expansion velocities of order 250 km/s
are detected in the wind material, and a lower limit of 2 x 10^{53} ergs is
derived for the kinetic energy of the outflow based on the gas kinematics and
the amount of ionized material entrained in the outflow. This is the first time
to our knowledge that a galactic wind is discovered using excitation maps. This
line ratio technique represents a promising new way to identify wind galaxy
candidates before undergoing more time-consuming spectroscopic follow-ups. This
method of selection may be particularly useful for samples of galaxies at

spectrum obtained with the Echelle Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) on the W.M.
Keck-II Telescope, as part of the Lenses Structure and Dynamics (LSD) Survey.
We find a velocity dispersion of sigma_ap=304+-27 km/s inside an effective
circular aperture with a radius of 0.65'', corresponding to a central velocity
dispersion of sigma=328+-32 km/s. From a Hubble Space Telescope F160W-band
image, we measure the effective radius and effective surface brightness in
order to determine the offset of the lens galaxy with respect to the local
Fundamental Plane. The offset corresponds to an evolution of the rest-frame
effective mass-to-light ratio of Delta log(M/L_B)=-0.62+-0.08 from z=0 to
z=1.004. By interpreting colors and offset of the FP with two independent
stellar population synthesis models, we obtain a single-burst equivalent age of
2.8+-0.8 Gyr (i.e. z_f>1.9) and a supersolar metallicity of
log[Z/Z_sun]=0.25+-0.25. The lens galaxy is therefore a massive elliptical
dominated by an old and metal rich stellar population at z>1. The excellent
agreement of the stellar velocity dispersion with that predicted from recent
lens models confirms that the angular separation of the multiple images of the
background QSO is predominantly due to the lens galaxy, and not to a massive
``dark cluster'', in agreement with recent weak lensing and X-ray observations.
However, the significant overdensity of galaxies in the field might indicate
that this system is a proto-cluster, in formation around galaxy D, responsible
for the ~10% external shear inferred from the strong lens models.

evolution of the clouds coupled to the chemistry through ion abundances. We
concentrate on two representative model clouds in this initial study, one with
magnetic fields and the other without. The model predictions on the peak values
and spatial distributions of the column densities of CO, CCS, N$_2$H$^+$ and
HCO$^+$ are compared with those observationally inferred for the well-studied
starless core L1544, which is thought to be on the verge of star formation. We
find that the magnetic model, in which the cloud is magnetically supported for
several million years before collapsing dynamically, provides a reasonable
overall fit to the available data on L1544; the fit is significantly worse for
the non-magnetic model, in which the cloud collapses promptly. The observed
large peak column density for N$_2$H$^+$ and clear central depression for CCS
favor the magnetically-retarded collapse over the free-fall collapse. A
relatively high abundance of CCS is found in the magnetic model, resulting most
likely from an interplay of depletion and late-time hydrocarbon chemistry
enhanced by CO depletion. These initial results lend some support to the
standard picture of dense core formation in strongly magnetized clouds through
ambipolar diffusion. They are at variance with those of Aikawa et al. (2001)
who considered a set of models somewhat different from ours and preferred one
in which the cloud collapses more or less freely for L1544.

simultaneous use of all colours, properly weighted by the photometric errors.
In addition, it provides basic information on the properties of the classified

xi^2-technique ideal for handling large multi-band datasets. The results are
compared to the more traditional colour-colour selection and, whenever

that the vortex motion has a periodic transverse velocity component even for
zero transverse AC drive. All the steps increase monotonically in width with AC

demonstrate scaling in the velocity versus applied DC driving curves at

commensurate vortex fillings where the interstitial vortices form symmetrical
ground states. For increasing temperature, the fractional steps are washed out

quantum disk with radius $R$, thickness $d$ and the electron is confined in the
disk, whereas the hole is located in the barrier. The exciton energy and
wavefunctions are calculated using a Hartree-Fock mesh method. We distinguish
two different regimes, namely $d<<2R$ (the hole is located at the radial
boundary of the disk) and $d>>2R$ (the hole is located above and below the
disk), for which angular momentum $(l)$ transitions are predicted with
increasing magnetic field. We also considered a system of two vertically
coupled dots where now an extra parameter is introduced, namely the interdot
distance $d_{z}$. For each $l_{h}$ and for a sufficient large magnetic field,
the ground state becomes spontaneous symmetry broken in which the electron and
the hole move towards one of the dots. This transition is induced by the
Coulomb interaction and leads to a magnetic field induced dipole moment. No
such symmetry broken ground states are found for a single dot (and for three
vertically coupled symmetric quantum disks). For a system of two vertically
coupled truncated cones, which is asymmetric from the start, we still find
angular momentum transitions. For a symmetric system of three vertically
coupled quantum disks, the system resembles for small $d_{z}$ the pillar-like
regime of a single dot, where the hole tends to stay at the radial boundary,
which induces angular momentum transitions with increasing magnetic field. For
larger $d_{z}$ the hole can sit between the disks and the $l_{h}=0$ state
remains the groundstate for the whole $B$-region.

description of light propagation in an inhomogeneous medium: light rays become
geodesics of the metric and the field vectors are parallel transported along
the rays. The new metric is connected to the usual flat space metric
diag[1,1,1] via a conformal transformation leading to new, effective values of
the medium parameters leading to an effective constant value of the index of
refraction n=1. The corresponding index of refraction is thus constant and so
is the effective velocity of light. Space becomes effectively empty but curved.

Feynman and the Coulomb gauge (formulated by Doust). We carry out further
studies of this model. We study properties of simple loop integrals involved in
an interpolating gauge. We find that the proof of continuation of a Green's
function from the Feynman gauge to the Coulomb gauge via such a gauge in a
gauge-invariant manner seems obstructed by the lack of differentiability of the
path-integral with respect to theta (at least at discrete values for a specific
Green's function considered) and/or by additional contributions to the
WT-identities. We show this by the consideration of simple loop diagrams for a
simple scattering process. The lack of differentiability, alternately, produces
a large change in the path-integral for a small enough change in theta near
some values. We find several applications of these observations in a gauge
field theory. We show that the usual procedure followed in the derivation of
the WT-identity that leads to the evaluation of a gauge variation of a Green's
function involves steps that are not always valid in the context of such
interpolating gauges. We further find new results related to the need for
keeping the epsilon-term in the in the derivation of the WT-identity and and a
nontrivial contribution to gauge variation from it. We also demonstrate how
arguments using Wick rotation cannot rid us of these problems. This work brings
out the pitfalls in the use of interpolating gauges in a clearer focus.

$\nu_{\mu}(-\Delta)^{\mu}$. By ``monoscale-like'' we mean that the forcing is
applied over a finite range of wavenumbers $k_\min \leq k \leq k_\max$, and
that the ratio of enstrophy injection $\eta \geq 0$ to energy injection
$\epsilon \geq 0$ is bounded by $k_\min^2 \epsilon \leq \eta \leq k_\max^2
\epsilon$. It is shown that for $\mu\geq 0$ the asymptotic behaviour satisfies
(eqnarray) \norm u_1^2&\leq&k_\max^2\norm u^2,(eqnarray) where $\norm u^2$ and
$\norm u_1^2$ are the energy and enstrophy, respectively. It is also shown that

rate is bounded from above by $2\nu_1 k_\max^2$. These results place strong
constraints on the spectral distribution of energy and enstrophy and of their
dissipation, and thereby on the existence of energy and enstrophy cascades, in

invalid for forced two-dimensional Navier--Stokes turbulence ($\mu=1$) when it

molecular viscosity permits a dual cascade, but is incompatible with the
log-modified -3 power law for the energy spectrum in the enstrophy-cascading

  2002)",,,,"nucl-ex",,"  Experiments on the production and study of superheavy nuclei have been
undertaken at GANIL taking advantages of the powerful velocity filter LISE3 and
the high intensity ECR ion sources. A complete set-up has been built: -
reaction chamber containing large rotating wheels, - slits and beam profiler at
mid-filter, - detection chamber with time-of-flight and Silicon detectors for
identifying evaporation residues and their decay products. The response was
checked via fusion reactions with known cross sections producing known
alpha-decay chains and fission fragments. Excellent transmission of evaporation
residues and rejection factor for the primary beam were obtained. This device
is presented together with the results obtained in our last experiments and our
future plans are discussed.

approximation for outgoing nucleon polarized responses in coincidence electron
scattering. Following recent approaches for non-relativistic reductions of the
electromagnetic current operator, here an exact treatment of the problem for
the transferred energy and momentum is presented. Rather than employing
existing non-relativistic expressions for the single-nucleon matrix elements,
in this work the response functions are expanded directly. Results are compared
for different kinematical situations with the fully-relativistic PWIA
calculation as well as with previous non-relativistic expansions. Off- and
`on-shell' prescriptions are also studied in detail, and a systematic analysis
of the various kinematical variables involved in the process is presented.

transfer to outgoing nucleons is studied within the context of relativistic
mean field theory. Effects introduced by the dynamical enhancement of the lower
components of the bound nucleon wave function are analyzed for the polarized
response functions and transferred polarization asymmetries assuming the
relativistic plane-wave impulse approximation (RPWIA). Results obtained by
projecting out the negative-energy components are compared with the
fully-relativistic calculation for proton knockout from $p_{1/2}$ and $p_{3/2}$
shells in $^{16}O$ for a variety of kinematic situations. The crucial role
played by the relativistic dynamics in some spin-dependent observables is
clearly manifested even for low/medium values of the missing momentum. The
degree to which knowledge about nucleon form factors can be extracted from
analyses of this type of process is also discussed.

resulting from the consideration of the usual 3-dimensional coordinates
complemented by proper time. The paper uses the established K-calculus to make
a parallel derivation of special relativity and 4-dimensional optics, allowing
a real possibility of comparison between the two theories. The significance of
proper time coordinate is given special attention and its definition is made
very clear in terms of just send and receive instants of radar pulses. The
4-dimensional optics equivalent to relativistic Lorentz transformations is
reviewed.
  Special relativity and 4-dimensional optics are also compared in terms of
Lagrangian definition of worldlines and movement Hamiltonian. The final section
of the paper discusses simultaneity through the solution of a two particle
head-on collision problem. It is shown that a very simple graphical
construction automatically solves energy and momentum conservation when the
observer is located at the collision position. A further discussion of the
representation for a distant observer further clarifies how simultaneity is
accommodated by 4DO.
