reconstruct the quintessence potential for a wide range of smoothly varying

it may be possible, for example, to distinguish between quintessence and the

Therefore, the recent suggestion, based on the analysis of the Hipparcos data,

space, is not supported by the data. Assuming random orientation, we derive the
mass distribution of the planet candidates and show that it is flat in log M,
up to about 10 Jupiter masses. Furthermore, the mass distribution of the planet
candidates is well separated from the mass distribution of the low-mass
companions by the 'brown-dwarf desert'. This indicates that we have here two
distinct populations, one which we identify as the giant planets and the other
as stellar secondaries. We compare the period and eccentricity distributions of
the two populations and find them surprisingly similar. The period
distributions between 10 and 1650 days are flat in log period, indicating a
scale-free formation mechanism in both populations. We further show that the
eccentricity distributions are similar - both have a density distribution peak
at about 0.2-0.4, with some small differences on both ends of the eccentricity
range. We present a toy model to mimic both distributions. We found a
significant paucity of massive giant planets with short orbital periods. The
low frequency of planets is noticeable for masses larger than about 1 Jupiter
Mass and periods shorter than 30 days. We point out how, in principle, one can
account for this paucity.

dust that is shed and heated through stellar mass loss as a subset of the
population moves through the AGB phase of evolution. Because this emission can
give direct insight into stellar evolution in addition to galactic stellar mass
loss and ISM injection rates, we conducted a program to search for this
signature emission with CAM on ISO. We obtained 6-15 micron imaging
observations in six narrow bands for nine elliptical galaxies; every galaxy is
detected in every band. For wavelengths shorter than 9 microns, the spectra are
well matched by a blackbody, originating from the K and M stars that dominate
the integrated light of elliptical galaxies. However, at wavelengths between 9
and 15 microns, the galaxies display excess emission relative to the stellar
photospheric radiation. Additional data taken with the fine resolution circular
variable filter on one source clearly shows broad emission from 9 to 15
microns, peaking around 10 microns. This result is consistent with the known,
broad silicate feature at 9.7 microns, originating in the circumstellar
envelopes of AGB stars. This emission is compared with studies of Galactic and
LMC AGB stars to derive cumulative mass loss rates. In general, these mass loss
rates agree with the expected ~0.8 solar masses per year value predicted by
stellar evolutionary models. Both the photospheric and circumstellar envelope
emission follow a de Vaucouleurs' R^{1/4} law, supporting the conclusion that
the mid-infrared excess emission originates in the stellar component of the
galaxies and acts as a tracer of AGB mass loss and mass injection into the ISM.

oscillation (QPO) around 840 Hz, and a 7.5 mHz QPO detected at energies below 5
keV. We find that the frequency of the kHz QPO is approximately anti-correlated
with the 2--5 keV X-ray count rate associated with the mHz QPO. The average kHz
QPO frequency varies by about 0.6 Hz (0.07%) during a mHz QPO cycle over which
the average 2--5 keV count rate varies by about 60 c/s (4%). This is opposite
to the frequency-count rate correlation observed in the same data on longer
time scales and hence constitutes the first example of a sign reversal in the
frequency-flux correlation related to the origin of the flux. Such a sign
reversal is predicted by the radiative disk truncation model for the case where
the flux variations originate on the neutron star but are not due to disk
accretion rate fluctuations. The results support the nuclear burning
interpretation of the mHz QPO, and the interpretation of the kHz QPO frequency
as an indicator of the orbital frequency at the inner edge of the accretion
disk. The varying radiative stresses on the inner disk exerted by the flux due
to the quasi-periodic nuclear burning lead to changes in the inner disk radius
and hence to the observed anti-correlation between kHz QPO frequency and X-ray
count rate. There is a time lag of about ten seconds of the X-ray count rate
relative to the kHz QPO frequency in terms of the anti-correlation we found
between these two quantities, which could be caused by the propagation of the
nuclear burning front on the neutron star away from the equatorial region.

  Astronomy & Astrophysics (in press) 2002",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20011786",,"astro-ph",,"  New estimates of the distances of 36 nearby galaxies are presented based on
accurate distances of galactic Cepheids obtained by Gieren, Fouque and Gomez
(1998) from the geometrical Barnes-Evans method.
  The concept of 'sosie' is applied to extend the distance determination to
extragalactic Cepheids without assuming the linearity of the PL relation. Doing
so, the distance moduli are obtained in a straightforward way.
  The correction for extinction is made using two photometric bands (V and I)
according to the principles introduced by Freedman and Madore (1990). Finally,
the statistical bias due to the incompleteness of the sample is corrected
according to the precepts introduced by Teerikorpi (1987) without introducing
any free parameters (except the distance modulus itself in an iterative
scheme).
  The final distance moduli depend on the adopted extinction ratio {R_V}/{R_I}
and on the limiting apparent magnitude of the sample. A comparison with the
distance moduli recently published by the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project
(HSTKP) team reveals a fair agreement when the same ratio {R_V}/{R_I} is used
but shows a small discrepancy at large distance.
  In order to bypass the uncertainty due to the metallicity effect it is
suggested to consider only galaxies having nearly the same metallicity as the
calibrating Cepheids (i.e. Solar metallicity). The internal uncertainty of the
distances is about 0.1 magnitude but the total uncertainty may reach 0.3
magnitude.

produces a burst of TeV neutrinos by photon-meson interaction, and eventually
breaks out of the stellar envelope appearing as a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB). Based
on recent numerical simulations and neutrino emission models, we predict the
expected neutrino diffuse flux from these PopIII GRBs and compare it with the
capabilities of present and planned detectors as AMANDA and IceCube. If beamed
into 1% of the sky, we find that the rate of PopIII GRBs is $\le 4 \times 10^6$
yr$^{-1}$. High energy neutrinos from PopIII GRBs could dominate the overall
flux in two energy bands [$10^4 - 10^5$] GeV and [$10^5 - 10^6$] GeV of
neutrino telescopes. The enhanced sensitivities of forthcoming detectors in the
high-energy band (AMANDA-II, IceCube) will provide a fundamental insight on the
characteristic explosion energies of PopIII GRBs and will constitute a unique
probe of the the Initial Mass Function (IMF) of the first stars and of the
redshift $z_f$ marking the metallicity-driven transition from a top-heavy to a
normal IMF. The current upper limit set by AMANDA-B10 implies that such
transition must have occurred not later than $z_f =9.2$ for the most plausible
jet energies. Based on such results, we speculate that PopIII GRBs, if not
chocked, could be associated with a new class of events detected by BeppoSax,
the Fast X-ray Transient (FXTs), which are bright X-ray sources, with peak
energies in the 2-10 keV band and durations between 10-200 s.

mass matrices for charged leptons as well as for up and down quarks. However,
for neutrinos this form becomes unitarily deformed by the action of bimaximal
mixing, specific in their case. The 3x3 lefthanded and righthanded components
(i.e., active-active and sterile-sterile components) of the 6x6 mass matrix are
diagonal with degenerate entries of opposite sign. They dominate over the 3x3
Dirac component. In such a texture the neutrino masses are $ m_1 = -m_4 \simeq

remain the oscillations of three active neutrinos, getting the form as for

Hamiltonian systems generated by a special class of Lie algebroids. The
``coordinate part'' of the Hamiltonian phase space is the Poisson manifold $M$
and the Lie algebroid brackets are defined by means of the Poisson bivector.
The Lie algebroid action defined on $M$ can be lifted to the phase space. The
main observation is that the classical BRST operator has the same form as in
the case of the Lie groups action. Two examples are analyzed. In the first, $M$
is the space of $SL(3,C)$-opers on Riemann curves with the Adler-Gelfand-Dikii
brackets. The corresponding Hamiltonian system is the $W_3$-gravity. Its phase
space is the base of the algebroid bundle. The sections of the bundle are the
second order differential operators on Riemann curves. They are the gauge
symmetries of the theory. The moduli space of $W_3$ geometry of Riemann curves
is the symplectic quotient with respect to their action. It is demonstrated
that the nonlinear brackets and the second order differential operators arise
from the canonical brackets and the standard gauge transformations in the
Chern-Simons field theory, as a result of the partial gauge fixing. The second
example is $M=C^4$ endowed with the Sklyanin brackets. The symplectic reduction
with respect to the algebroid action leads to a generalization of the rational
Calogero-Moser model. As in the previous example the Sklyanin brackets can be
derived from a ``free theory.'' In this case it is a ``relativistic
deformation'' of the $SL(2,C)$ Higgs bundle over an elliptic curve.

thus defining a new class of multicritical matrix models. The corresponding
microscopic scaling law is given and possible applications to the chiral phase
transition in QCD are discussed. For generic coupling constants off-criticality
we prove that all microscopic correlation functions at the origin of the
spectrum remain in the known Bessel universality class. An arbitrary number of
Dirac mass terms can be included and the corresponding massive universality is
maintained as well. We also investigate the critical behavior at the edge of
the spectrum: there, in contrast to the behavior at the origin, we find the
same critical exponents as derived from matrix models with a polynomial action.
