J030117+002025 (RD0301 hereafter) at 250 GHz (1.20mm) using the Max-Planck
Millimeter Bolometer (MAMBO) array at the IRAM 30-meter telescope. The quasar
was detected with a 1.2mm flux density of 0.87 +-0.20 mJy. The lack of
detectable 1.4 GHz radio emission indicates that the millimeter emission is of
thermal nature, making RD0301 the most distant dust-emission source known. When
matching a 50K grey body thermal far-infrared (FIR) spectrum to the observed
millimeter flux we imply a FIR luminosity ~4x10^12 L_sun, which is comparable
to the quasar's optical luminosity. If the FIR luminosity arises from massive
star formation, the implied star formation rate would be ~600 M_sun/yr,
comparable to that of the starburst galaxies which dominate the average star
formation and FIR emission in the early Universe. The FIR luminosity of RD0301
is close to the average of that found in optically far more luminous
high-redshift quasars. The comparably high millimeter to optical brightness
ratio of RD0301 is further evidence for that there is no strong correlation
between the optical and millimeter brightness of high-redshift quasars,
supporting the idea that in high-redshift quasars the dust is not heated by the
AGN, but by starbursts.

buildup of J is modeled via dynamical friction and tidal stripping in mergers.
This reveals how over-cooling in incoming halos leads to transfer of J from
baryons to dark matter (DM), in conflict with observations. By incorporating a
simple recipe of supernova feedback, we match the observed J distribution in
disks. Gas removal from small incoming halos, which make the low-J component of
the product, eliminates the low-J baryons. Partial heating and puffing-up of
the gas in larger incoming halos, combined with tidal stripping, reduces the J
loss of baryons. This implies a higher baryonic spin for lower mass halos. The
observed low baryonic fraction in dwarf galaxies is used to calibrate the
characteristic velocity associated with supernova feedback, yielding v_fb sim
100 km/s, within the range of theoretical expectations. The model then
reproduces the observed distribution of spin parameter among dwarf and bright
galaxies, as well as the J distribution inside these galaxies. This suggests
that the model captures the main features of a full scenario for resolving the
spin crisis.

  The work presented here attempts to model the H shell instability by a simple
mechanism of altering the energy production in the region of the H shell. We
show that even extreme cases only give rise to small intermittent temperature
increases that have minimal affect on the surface abundances. Full evolutionary
modelling incorporating this technique simply accelerates the evolution of the
RGB phase producing the same surface abundances as other models but at an
earlier time. We conclude that, unless hydrogen shell instabilities manifest
themselves quite differently, they are unlikely to lead to the required

promising.

structures on sub-horizon cosmological scales, starting from linear
perturbations in scalar-tensor cosmologies. We show that the coupling of the
dark energy scalar field, or Quintessence, to the Ricci scalar induces a
""dragging"" of its density perturbations through the general relativistic
gravitational potentials. We discuss, in particular, how this process forces
dark energy to behave as a pressureless component if the cosmic evolution is
dominated by non-relativistic matter. This property is also analyzed in terms
of the effective sound speed of the dark energy, which correspondingly
approaches the behavior of the dominant cosmological component, being
effectively vanishing after matter-radiation equality. To illustrate this
effect, we consider Extended Quintessence scenarios involving a quadratic
coupling between the field and the Ricci scalar. We show that Quintessence
density perturbations reach non-linearity at scales and redshifts relevant for
the structure formation process, respecting all the existing constraints on
scalar-tensor theories of Gravity. This study opens new perspectives on the
standard picture of structure formation in dark energy cosmologies, since the
Quintessence field itself, if non-minimally coupled to Gravity, may undergo
clustering processes, eventually forming density perturbations exiting from the
linear regime. A non-linear approach is then required to further investigate
the evolution of these structures, and in particular their role in the dark
haloes surrounding galaxies and clusters.

temperature (T). We believe that the complex melting patterns are due to a
random distribution of material disorder or inhomogeneities across the sample,
which create fluctuations in the local melting temperature or field value. To
study the fluctuations in the local melting temperature / field, we have
constructed maps of the melting landscape T_m(H,r), viz., the melting
temperature (T_m) at a given location (r) in the sample at a given field (H). A
study of these melting landscapes reveals an unexpected feature: the melting
landscape is not fixed, but changes rather dramatically with varying field and
temperature along the melting line. It is concluded that the changes in both
the scale and shape of the landscape result from the competing contributions of
different types of quenched disorder which have opposite effects on the local
melting transition.

correlations. The superfluid-to-normal transition reveals itself in the
specific variation of the ratio ${\cal B}/{\cal A}$ versus spin $I$ with the
plateau characteristic of the normal phase. We find this dependence to be
universal for normal deformed and superdeformed bands. The long plateau with a
small value ${\cal B}/{\cal A}\sim A^{-8/3}$ explains the extreme regularity of
superdeformed bands.

components whose contribution to the total wave function completely cancels
out. We propose a practical method to solve this Faddeev equation, by
eliminating the admixture of such redundant components. A complete equivalence
between the present Faddeev approach and a variational approach using the
translationally invariant harmonic-oscillator basis is numerically shown with
respect to the 3 alpha bound state corresponding to the ground state of 12C.

two energy scales into the study of chaotic systems: One is obviously the mean
level spacing $\Delta\propto\hbar^d$, where $d$ is the dimensionality; The
other is $\Delta_b\propto\hbar$, which is known as the non-universal energy
scale, or as the bandwidth, or as the Thouless energy. Associated with these
two energy scales are two special quantum-mechanical (QM) regimes in the theory
of driven system. These are the QM adiabatic regime, and the QM
non-perturbative regime respectively. Otherwise Fermi golden rule applies, and
linear response theory can be trusted. Demonstrations of this general idea,
that had been published in 1999, have appeared in studies of wavepacket
dynamics, survival probability, dissipation, quantum irreversibility, fidelity
and dephasing.
