modeled as spherical isothermal gaseous halos ionized by the external cosmic
background. The effects of self-shielding introduce a hump in this
distribution, at a column density N_{HI} \sim 1.6x10^{17} X^{-1} cm^{-2}, where
X is the neutral fraction at the radius where self-shielding starts being
important. The most recent compilation of the column density distribution by
Storrie-Lombardi & Wolfe shows marginal evidence for the detection of this
feature due to self-shielding, suggesting a value X \sim 10^{-3}. Assuming a
photoionization rate \Gamma \sim 10^{-12} s^{-1} from the external ionizing
background, the radius where self-shielding occurs is inferred to be about
3.8kpc. If damped Lyman alpha systems consist of a clumpy medium, this should
be interpreted as the typical size of the gas clumps in the region where they
become self-shielding. Clumps of this size with typical column densities N_H
\sim 3x10^{20} cm^{-2} would be in hydrostatic equilibrium at the
characteristic photoionization temperature \sim 10^4 K if they do not contain
dark matter. Since this size is similar to the overall radius of damped \lya
systems in Cold Dark Matter models, where all halos are assumed to contain
similar gas clouds producing damped absorbers, this suggests that the gas in
damped absorbers is in fact not highly clumped.

much substructure is left over from the inhomogeneous growth of the halo, and
how it may affect the signal in experiments aimed at detecting the dark matter

find that the dark-matter is smoothly distributed in space. The probability of
detecting particles bound within dense lumps of individual mass less than 10^7
M_\sun h^{-1} is small, less than 10^{-2}. The velocity ellipsoid in the Solar
neighbourhood deviates only slightly from a multivariate Gaussian, and can be
thought of as a superposition of thousands of kinematically cold streams. The
motions of the most energetic particles are, however, strongly clumped and
highly anisotropic. We conclude that experiments may safely assume a smooth
multivariate Gaussian distribution to represent the kinematics of dark-matter

motion of the incident particles could exploit the expected anisotropy to learn
about the recent merging history of our Galaxy.

  Two active regions of star formation are located at the tips of the optical

in disks surrounding young stars and in the solar system comet Hale-Bopp. A
significant fraction of the emission bands cannot be identified with either
olivines or pyroxenes. Possible other materials that may be the carriers of
these unidentified bands are briefly discussed. There is a natural division
into objects that show a disk-like geometry (strong crystalline silicate
bands), and objects whose dust shell is characteristic of an outflow (weak
crystalline silicate bands). In particular, stars with the 33.5 micron olivine
band stronger than about 20 percent over continuum are invariably disk sources.
Likewise, the 60 micron region is dominated by crystalline silicates in the
disk sources, while it is dominated by crystalline H(2)O ice in the outflow
sources. We show that the disk and outflow sources have significant differences
in the shape of the emission bands. This difference must be related to the
composition or grain shapes of the dust particles. The incredible richness of
the crystalline silicate spectra observed by ISO allows detailed studies of the
mineralogy of these dust shells, and is the origin and history of the dust.

ratio differs, it is slightly higher in the outflow sources with respect to the

hypothesis. We show that the 69.0 micron feature, attributed to forsterite, may
be a very suitable temperature indicator. We found that the enstatite is more
abundant than forsterite in almost all sources. The temperature of the
enstatite grains is about equal to that of the forsterite grains in the disk
sources but slightly lower in the outflow sources. Crystalline silicates are on
average colder than amorphous silicates. This may be due to the difference in
Fe content of both materials. Finally we find an indication that the ratio of

ortho enstatite in the high luminosity (outflow) sources.

forming a higher density ring. Using several simplifying assumptions, I derive
an expression for the radius of the ring, which depends relatively weakly on
the jets and impulsive mass loss episode properties. This shows that such a
scenario is feasible. If there are several such impulsive mass loss episodes,
more double rings will be formed, as observed in the planetary nebulae MyCn 18

the double-ring system is displaced from the symmetry axis of the main nebula,

concave with a very hard component above 5-6 keV (alpha_1 ~ 1.6; alpha_2 ~

During the first BeppoSAX observation BL Lac showed an astonishing variability
episode: the 0.3 - 2 keV flux doubled in ~ 20 minutes, while the flux above 4
keV was almost constant. This frequency-dependent event is one of the shortest
ever recordered for BL Lac objects and places lower limits on the dimension and

minutes, which have been ascribed to accretion onto a magnetic white dwarf,
with the X-ray pulses seen as the accreting pole moves into and out of view.
The X-ray flux drops to zero between pulses, and no other periods are seen,
suggesting that V407 Vul is a type of system known as a ``polar'' in which the
white dwarf has a strong enough field to lock to the orbit of its companion. If
so, then V407 Vul has the shortest orbital period known for any binary star.
However, unlike other polars, V407 Vul shows neither polarization nor line
emission. In this paper we propose that V407 Vul is the first example of a new
type of X-ray emitting binary in which the mass transfer stream directly hits a
non-magnetic white dwarf as a result of the very compact orbit. Our model
naturally explains the X-ray and optical pulsations, as well as the absence of
polarization and line emission. We show that direct impact will occur for
plausible masses of the accreting star and its companion, e.g. M1 ~ 0.5, M2 ~
0.1 Msun. In our model V407 Vul retains its status as the binary star with the
shortest known orbital period, and is therefore a strong source of
low-frequency gravitational waves. V407 Vul is representative of an early phase
of the evolution of the AM CVn class of binary stars and will evolve into the
normal disc-accretion phase on a timescale of 10^6 to 10^7 yr. The existence of
V407 Vul supports the double-degenerate route for the formation of AM CVn
stars.

cases in which the production occurs in the form of a bunch of particles
created in a pulse of very short duration. We calculate the spectra of the

At high temperatures, there is a large propensity for the establishment of
$\beta$-strands whereas $\alpha$-helices appear only when the temperature is
lower than a certain threshold value. It is found that there exists an optimal
temperature at which the correct secondary structures are predicted most
accurately. We find that this temperature is close to the peak temperature of
the specific heat. Changing the interaction window or carrying out longer
simulations approaching equilibrium lead to little change in the optimal
success rate. Our findings are in accord with the observation by Srinivasan and

uses the fact that nontrivial problems in statistical physics are high

up in many, usually biased, steps. Due to the bias, each configuration carries
its weight which changes at every step. If the bias is close to optimal, all
weights are similar and importance sampling is perfect. If not, ``population
control"" is applied by cloning/killing partial configurations with too high/low
weight. This is done such that the final (weighted) distribution is unbiased.

Monte Carlo) to several problems of polymer statistics, reaction-diffusion

belong to different electronic bands is presented. These electronic bands arise
because of a symmetry breaking at the critical temperature in such a way that
one electron sees the other as if its mass would be negative. This symmetry
breaking leads also to an energy gap (centered round of the Fermi level)
between the coupled electrons. Under the assumption that electric resistance is
due to electron-phonon interaction, a general equation from which the
fundamental properties of any metallic superconductor can be derived is also
presented. In the frame of this theory, the electron-phonon interaction (or
electric resistance) is cancelled out by the electron-electron interaction in
the super-conducting state. Moreover, the Bardeen-Cooper- Schrieffer (BCS)
theory is a particular case of our theory and equations, a matter, which leads
to a better overall agreement with experimental data.

times diverge exponentially with free energy barriers $\Delta F$, which in

Ising-model at temperature $T/T_c=0.63$ for two different lattice manifolds,
toroidal lattices and surfaces of cubes. For both geometries the effect is
caused by discontinuous droplet shape transitions between various classical
crystal shapes obeying geometrical constraints. We use classical droplet theory
and numerical simulations to calculate transition points and barrier heights.
On toroidal lattices we determine finite size corrections to the droplet free
energy, which are given by a linear combination of Gibbs-Thomson corrections,
capillary wave fluctuation corrections, constant terms and logarithmic terms in
the droplet volume. Tolman corrections are absent. In addition, we study the
finite size effects on the condensation phase transition, which occurs in
infinite systems at the Onsager value of the magnetization. We find that this
transition is of discontinuous order also. A combination of classical droplet
theory and Gibbs-Thomson corrections yields a fair description for the
transition point and for the droplet size discontinuity for large droplets. We
also estimate the nucleation barrier that has to be surmounted in the formation
of the stable droplet at coexistence.

reported, which is based on an algebraic realization of the Ginsparg-Wilson

  $\gamma_{5}(\gamma_{5}D)+(\gamma_{5}D)\gamma_{5} =
  2a^{2k+1}(\gamma_{5}D)^{2k+2}$ where $k$ stands for a non-negative integer.
The choice $k=0$ corresponds to the commonly discussed Ginsparg-Wilson relation
and thus to the overlap operator. We study one-loop fermion contributions to
the self-energy of the gauge field, which are related to the fermion
contributions to the one-loop $\beta$ function and to the Weyl anomaly. We
first explicitly demonstrate that the Ward identity is satisfied by the
self-energy tensor. By performing careful analyses, we then obtain the correct
self-energy tensor free of infra-red divergences, as a general consideration of
the Weyl anomaly indicates. This demonstrates that our general operators give
correct chiral and Weyl anomalies. In general, however, the Wilsonian effective
action, which is supposed to be free of infra-red complications, is expected to
be essential in the analyses of our general class of Dirac operators for
dynamical gauge field.

  D, E","Memoires de la SMF, 92 (2003)",,,"math-ph math.DS math.MP math.SP",,"  In this text we consider discrete Laplace operators defined on lattices based
on finitely-ramified self-similar sets, and their continuous analogous defined
on the self-similar sets themselves. We are interested in the spectral
properties of these operators. The basic example is the lattice based on the
Sierpinski gasket. We introduce a new renormalization map which appears to be a
rational map defined on a smooth projective variety (more precisely, this
variety is isomorphic to a product of three types of Grassmannians: complex
Grassmannians, Lagrangian Grassmannians, orthogonal Grassmannians). We relate
some characteristics of the dynamics of its iterates with some characteristics
of the spectrum of our operator. More specifically, we give an explicit formula
for the density of states in terms of the Green current of the map, and we
relate the indeterminacy points of the map with the so-called Neuman-Dirichlet
eigenvalues which lead to eigenfunctions with compact support on the unbounded
lattice. Depending on the asymptotic degree of the map we can prove drastically
different spectral properties of the operators. Our formalism is valid for the
general class of finitely ramified self-similar sets (i.e. for the class of pcf
self-similar sets of Kigami). Hence, this work aims at a generalization and a
better understanding of the initial work of the physicists Rammal and Toulouse
on the Sierpinski gasket.

significantly in hot and dense hadronic matter due to vacuum polarisation
effects from the baryon sector in the Walecka model. The vector meson mass
drops significantly in the medium due to the effects of the Dirac sea. In the
variational approach adopted in the present paper, these effects are taken into
account through a realignment of the ground state with baryon condensates. Such
a realignment of the ground state becomes equivalent to summing of the baryonic
tadpole diagrams in the relativistic Hartree approximation (RHA). The
approximation scheme adopted here goes beyond RHA to include quantum effects
from the scalar meson and is nonperturbative and self--consistent. It includes
multiloop effects, thus corresponding to a different approximation as compared
to the one loop approximation of including scalar field quantum corrections. In
the present work, we study the properties of the vector mesons in the hot and
dense matter as modified due to such quantum correction effects from the baryon
as well as scalar meson sectors. These medium modifications of the properties
of the vector mesons are reflected, through the shifting and broadening of the
respective peaks, in the low mass dilepton spectra. There is broadening of the
peaks due to corrections from scalar meson quantum effects as compared to the
relativistic Hartree approximation. It is seen to be rather prominent for the
$\omega$ meson in the invariant mass plot.

adding interactions depending on the angular momentum. These interactions can

classification of the singularities of the resolvent, which are associated with
bound states and resonances. The latter are then studied using an appropriate

with large photon number N. We show that the same entangled states can
simultaneously exhibit a factor of 1/sqrt(N) reduction in noise below the
classical shot noise limit in precise timing applications, as was previously
suggested by Giovannetti, Lloyd and Maccone (Nature v412 (2001) p417). The
quantum-mechanical noise reduction can be destroyed by a relatively small
amount of uncompensated dispersion and entangled states of this kind have
larger timing uncertainties than the corresponding classical states in that
case. Similar results were obtained for correlated states, anti-correlated
states, and frequency-entangled coherent states, which shows that these effects
are a fundamental result of entanglement.

a cavity QED system that consists of a single two-level atom dressed by a leaky
optical cavity field. We establish a diagrammatic method to construct the

scattered photons for an arbitrary incident photon packet. As an application,
we explicitly solve the problem of a single-photon packet scattered by an
initially excited atom.

entangled, without any direct interaction. We present a model using local
variables aiming at reproducing this remarkable process, under the realistic
assumption of finite detection efficiencies. The model assumes that the local
variables describing the two qubits are initially completely uncorrelated.
Nevertheless, we show that once conditioned on the Bell measurement result, the
local variables bear enough correlation to simulate quantum measurement results
with correlation very close to the quantum prediction. When only a partial Bell
measurement is simulated, as carried out is all experiments so far, then the
model recovers analytically the quantum prediction.

  measurements","19 pages, no figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.66.022310",,"quant-ph",,"  We investigate the evolution of a single qubit subject to a continuous
unitary dynamics and an additional interrupting influence which occurs
periodically. One may imagine a dynamically evolving closed quantum system
which becomes open at certain times. The interrupting influence is represented
by an operation, which is assumed to equivalently describe a non-selective
unsharp measurement. It may be decomposed into a positive operator, which in
case of a measurement represents the pure measurement part, followed by an
unitary back-action operator. Equations of motion for the state evolution are
derived in the form of difference equations. It is shown that the 'free'
Hamiltonian is completed by an averaged Hamiltonian, which goes back to the
back-action. The positive operator specifies a decoherence rate and results in
a decoherence term. The continuum limit to a master equation is performed. The
selective evolution is discussed and correcting higher order terms are worked
out in an Appendix.
