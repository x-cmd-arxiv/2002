made in a 2.25 hour exposure with the Echelle Spectrograph and Imager on the
Keck II telescope through a spectroscopic slit of dimensions 1"" x 20"". The
progenitor of the emission line, J123649.2+621539 (hereafter ES1), lies in the
Hubble Deep Field North West Flanking Field where it appears faint and compact,
subtending just 0.3"" (FWHM) with I(AB) = 25.4. The ES1 Ly-alpha line flux of
3.0 x 10^(-17) ergs/cm^2/s corresponds to a luminosity of 9.0 x 10^(42) ergs/s,
and the line profile shows the sharp blue cut-off and broad red wing commonly
observed in star-forming systems and expected for radiative transfer in an
expanding envelope. We find that the Ly-alpha profile is consistent with a
galaxy-scale outflow with a velocity of v > 300 km/s. This value is consistent
with wind speeds observed in powerful local starbursts (typically 10^2 to 10^3
km/s), and compares favorably to simulations of the late-stage evolution of
Ly-alpha emission in star-forming systems. We discuss the implications of this
high-redshift galactic wind for the early history of the evolution of galaxies
and the intergalactic medium, and for the origin of the UV background at z > 3.

1$, the field is fully opened by the wind outflow, but nonetheless for

to host a short bar of semi-major axis 22"" (1.6 kpc). From dynamical and
morphological arguments, we argue, however, that its spiral structure is being
driven by a large-scale bar whose corotation radius lies at around 115"" (8.6
kpc).Our estimate is based partially on a deep R-band image which reveals that
the feature previously thought to be an inclined disk is in fact an extended
stellar bar. The bar is embedded within a fainter outer disk visible out to a
radius of 230"" (17.2 kpc). The bar has a deprojected ellipticity of 0.44 and a
semi-major axis of 95"" (7.1 kpc). The classical grand-design spirals of NGC
5248, prominent in B, R, and K light, lie on the leading edge of the
large-scale stellar bar and are accompanied by concave dust lanes out to at
least 70"". The offset between the dust and young stars is consistent with our
understanding of gas flows in barred galaxies, where shocks along the leading
edges of a moderately strong bar compress the gas to form massive young stars.
While in many strongly barred galaxies, optical spiral arms are prominent
outside the bar but not within it, NGC 5248 illustrates how intense star
formation along a moderately strong bar can lead to conspicuous open spiral
arms within the bar itself. NGC 5248 also provides a clear example of how a
large-scale stellar bar embedded within a faint outer optical disk can be
misidentified as an inclined disk when imaging studies lack the sensitivity to
detect the actual outer disk. We discuss the implications for the estimated bar
fraction at higher redshifts.

and the subsequent transfer of energy from larger to smaller scales. We
calculate the power spectra for the large-scale velocity field and show that
the coupling of modes results in a transfer of power predominately from larger
to smaller scales. We use the concept of cumulative energy for calculating
which energy amount is deposited into the small scales during the cosmological
structure evolution. To estimate the contribution due to the gravitational
interaction only we perform our investigations by means of dark matter
simulations. The global mean of the energy transfer increases with redshift
$\sim (z+1)^{3}$; this can be traced back to the similar evolution of the
merging rates of dark matter halos.
  The global mean energy transfer can be decomposed into its local
contributions, which allows to determine the energy injection per mass into a
local volume. The obtained energy injection rates are at least comparable with
other energy sources driving the interstellar turbulence as, e.g. by the
supernova kinetic feedback. On that basis we make the crude assumption that
processes causing this energy transfer from large to small scales, e.g. the
merging of halos, may contribute substantially to drive the ISM turbulence
which may eventually result in star formation on much smaller scales. We
propose that the ratio of the local energy injection rate to the energy already
stored within small-scale motions is a rough measure for the probability of the
local star formation efficiency applicable within cosmological large-scale
n-body simulations.

is due entirely to stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), it implies an
age for the population of > 2 Gyr; if foreground RGB stars contribute to the
luminous tail, then the derived age for the stars is older still. The
luminosity function also suggests that most of the intracluster stars are

with a density profile \rho \propto r^{-\alpha} where \alpha \to \alpha_a \gsim
1$. Our analysis is based on a new prescription for tidal stripping as a
function of \alpha(r), using a simple toy model which matches N-body
simulations. In a core of \alpha < 1 there is tidal compression rather than
stripping and the satellites sink towards the halo center, causing a rapid
steepening of the profile to \alpha > 1. Where \alpha > 1, the stripping of
each satellite shell is preceded by gradual puffing up, which makes the
stripping more efficient at larger \alpha, causing flattening where \alpha is
large enough. Therefore, we can show using linear perturbation analysis that a
sequence of mergers slowly leads to a fixed point \alpha(r)=\alpha_a. This
result implies that a cusp is enforced as long as enough satellite material
makes it into the inner halo and is deposited there. We conclude that in order
to maintain a flat core, as indicated by observations, satellites must be
disrupted outside the core, e.g., because of puffing up due to baryonic

  Radiation","Ph.D. Thesis, 196 pages, 73 figures, LaTeX document",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) is an invaluable probe of the
conditions of the early universe. Recent measurements of its spatial anisotropy
have allowed accurate determinations of several fundamental cosmological
parameters, such as the curvature of the universe, the shape of the spectrum of
primordial density fluctuations, and the contribution of baryons, dark matter,
and dark energy to the overall energy density of the universe. In addition to
being spatially non-uniform, the CMB is theorized to be slightly polarized.
Measurements of this polarization, particularly at large angular scales, have
the potential to provide information on primordial gravitational waves,
theories of inflation, and the ionization history of the universe, as well as
help further constrain cosmological parameters.
  Polarization has not yet been detected in the CMB. This thesis describes a
recent search for CMB polarization at large angular scales, conducted in the
spring of 2000 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After a general
introduction on both CMB polarization and general microwave polarimetry,
details of the experiment itself are given, as well as a full description of
the data selection and analysis techniques. Using these techniques, our data
lead to a new upper limit on CMB polarization at large angular scales of 10
$\mu$K in both E- and B-type polarization at 95% confidence. If B-polarization
is assumed to be zero, the limit for E-type polarization is lowered to 8
$\mu$K. This experiment is the first of a new breed of highly-sensitive
instruments that will one day map out this interesting property of the Cosmic
Microwave Background Radiation.

abundance distribution as given by time dependent diffusion processes. Results
are compared with the standard treatment of diffusive equilibrium in the trace
element approximation. Appreciable differences are found between the two

important role in determining the whole oscillation pattern and the temporal

from 1993 August to 1996 April when the source was previously believed to be
quiescent. Combining BATSE, RXTE, and EXOSAT data we have derived an improved
orbital solution. Applying this solution results in a smooth profile for the
spin-up rate during the giant outburst and results in evidence for a
correlation between the spin-up rate and observed flux in the brighter BATSE
outbursts. Infrared and Halpha measurements show a decline in the density of
the circumstellar disk around the Be star. This decline is followed by a sudden
drop in the X-ray flux and a turn-over from a spin-up trend to spin-down in the
frequency history. This is the first Be/X-ray binary which shows an extended
interval, about 2.5 years, where the global trend is spin-down, but the
outbursts continue. In 1995 the orbital phase of EXO 2030+375's outbursts
shifted from peaking about 6 days after periastron to peaking before
periastron. The outburst phase slowly recovered to peaking at about 2.5 days
after periastron. We interpret this shift in orbital phase followed by a slow
recovery as evidence for a global one-armed oscillation propagating in the Be
disk. This is further supported by changes in the shape of the Halpha profile
which are commonly believed to be produced by a reconfiguration of the Be disk.
The truncated viscous decretion disk model provides an explanation for the long
series of normal outbursts and the evidence for an accretion disk in the
brighter normal outbursts.

model. The source most likely represents an optically thick accretion disk
around an intermediate mass black hole in its high/soft state, similar to other
variable ultraluminous X-ray sources observed in nearby disk galaxies. Using
constraints derived from both the innermost stable orbit around a black hole
and the Eddington luminosity, we find that the black hole is fast-rotating and
that its mass is between $\sim 20/({\rm cos} i) {\rm M}_{\odot} - 110/({\rm

The inferred bolometric luminosity of the accretion disk is $\sim (8 \times

optical nebula is very energetic and may contain large amounts of hot gas,
accounting for a soft X-ray component as indicated by archival ROSAT PSPC data.
The nebula is apparently associated with X-9; the latter may be powering the
former and/or they could be formed in the same event (e.g., a hypernova). Such

all components of the magnetic field calculated explicitly, assuming axial
symmetry and a constant turbulent diffusivity eta and viscosity nu. We find
that a sufficiently strong oscillatory poloidal field with dipolar latitude
dependence at the tachocline-convective zone boundary is able to confine the
tachocline. Exploring the three-dimensional parameter space defined by the
viscosity in the range log(nu)=9-11, the magnetic Prandtl number in the range
Prm=0.1-10, and the meridional flow amplitude (-3 to +3 cm/s), we also find
that the confining field strength B_conf, necessary to reproduce the observed
thickness of the tachocline, increases with viscosity nu, with magnetic Prandtl
number nu/eta, and with equatorward meridional flow speed. Nevertheless, the
resulting B_conf values remain quite reasonable, in the range 10^3-10^4 G, for
all parameter combinations considered here. The thickness of the tachocline
shows a marked dependence on both time and latitude. A comparison with seismic
constraints suggests that best agreement with our models is achieved for the

the X-ray emitting plasma halo of M~87, the cD galaxy of the Virgo Cluster.
Using the MEKAL model, the data provide strong indications that the
intracluster medium has a single phase structure locally, except the regions
associated to the radio structures. The deprojected spectrum at each radius is
well fitted by a single temperature MEKAL model, except for the very central
region ($<$ 2 arcmin) which seems to be affected by the jet and radio lobe
structure. The temperature of the intracluster plasma is 1 keV at the center
and gradually increases to 2.5 keV at 80 kpc. We have also fitted spectra using
the APEC code. Although the large changes of the strength of K$\alpha$ lines
causes a discrepancy between the Fe-L and Fe-K lines for the APEC results, the
overall temperature structure has not changed. There is no sign of excess
absorption in the spectral data. The single-phase nature of the intracluster
medium is in conflict with the standard cooling flow model which is based on a
multi-phase temperature structure. In addition, the signature of gas cooling
below 0.8 keV to zero temperature is not observed as expected for a cooling
flow. The gravitational mass profile derived from the temperature and density
distribution of the intracluster gas shows two distinct contributions that can
be assigned to the gravitational potential of the cD galaxy and the cluster.
The central temperature of the intracluster medium agrees well with the
potential depth and the velocity dispersion of the cD galaxy. The latter result
implies that the central region of the intracluster medium is equivalent to a
virialized interstellar medium in M 87.

images for six of these objects as well. The results indicate that the
luminosity sample distribution has an amplitude of almost 4 magnitudes with an
average of M_B=-20.7. The observed morphologies are confined to early type
galaxies. A barred structure is found in only 2 objects. Despite that early
morphological types are dominant in this sample, integrated (B-V) colors are
very blue. For instance, the SO galaxies show, on average, a (B-V)=0.78. This
effect seems to be caused by the luminosity contribution of the active nucleus
and/or the disk to the total luminosity of the galaxy. In the B band, the
contribution of the active galactic nucleus to the total luminosity of the
galaxy varies from 3% to almost 60% and the bulge to disk luminosity ratio
(L_bulge/L_disk) ranges from 0.6 to 22. Signs of tidal interactions seems to be
a common characteristic since they are observed in 6 of the objects and one of
them seems to be located in a poor cluster not yet identified in the
literature. H_alpha extended emission is rare, with only 1 galaxy showing clear
evidence of it. Luminosity profile decomposition shows that the model Gauss +
bulge + disk properly reproduces the surface brightness of the galaxies.
However, in order to account for the luminosity profile, most of the disk
galaxies needs the inner truncated exponential form with a central cutoff
radius ranging from 3 to 10 kpc. This is interpreted in terms of reddened
regions that are well identified in the B-V color maps. These regions present
very similar colors among them, with (B-V)~1.2. This fact could be associated
to the presence of dust confined in the inner regions of the galaxies.

Bose condensed gas perturbed away from thermal equilibrium. The idea of the
method is to generate an ensemble of classical fields which samples the Wigner
function of the initial thermal density operator, and to evolve each field with
the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). In the first part of the paper we improve
the sampling technique over our previous work and we test its accuracy against
the exactly solvable model of the ideal gas. In the second part of the paper we
investigate the conditions of validity of the TWM. For short evolution times
the time-dependent Bogoliubov approximation is valid for almost pure
condensates. The requirement that the TWM reproduces the Bogoliubov prediction
leads to the constraint that the number of field modes must be smaller than the
number of particles.For longer times the nonlinear dynamics of the noncondensed
modes plays an important role. To demonstrate this we analyse the case of a 3D
spatially homogeneous Bose condensed gas and we test how well TWM reproduces
Beliaev-Landau damping.We have identified the mechanism which limits the
validity of the TWM: the initial classical fields, driven by the time-dependent
GPE, thermalise to a classical field distribution at a temperature T_class
larger than the initial temperature T. When T_class significantly exceeds T a
spurious damping is observed in the simulation. This leads to the second
condition for the TWM, T_class-T<<T, which requires that the maximum energy of
the Bogoliubov modes does not exceed a few k_B T.

for generating long, compact, self avoiding walks. The growth process in IGW is
tuned by the so called growth temperature $T' = 1/(k_B \beta ')$. On a square
lattice and at $T' = 0$, IGW is attrition free and hence grows indefinitely. In
this paper we consider IGW on a honeycomb lattice. We take contact energy, see

to the geometric area e^{S(E,N,V)/k} of the manifold of constant energy in the
finite-N-body phase space. From the principle, all thermodynamics and
especially all phenomena of phase transitions and critical phenomena can
unambiguously be identified for even small systems. The topology of the
curvature matrix C(E,N) of S(E,N) determines regions of pure phases, regions of
phase separation, and (multi-)critical points and lines. Within
  Boltzmann's principle, Statistical Mechanics becomes a geometric theory
addressing the whole ensemble or the manifold of all points in phase space
which are consistent with the few macroscopic conserved control parameters.
This interpretation leads to a straight derivation of irreversibility and the
Second Law of Thermodynamics out of the time-reversible, microscopic,
mechanical dynamics. This is all possible without invoking the thermodynamic
limit, extensivity, or concavity of S(E,N,V). The main obstacle against the
Second Law, the conservation of the phase-space volume due to Liouville is
overcome by realizing that a macroscopic theory like Thermodynamics cannot
distinguish a fractal distribution in phase space from its closure.

for their interpretation. As the field alignment is varied, the shape of the
decay curve changes from Gaussian (H_0 \parallel c) to single exponential (H_0
\perp c). The latter characterizes the decay caused by the fluctuations of
adjacent Cu nuclear spins caused by their interactions with electron spins. The
angular dependence of the second moment (T_{2M}^{-2} \equiv <\Delta \omega^2>)
deduced from the decay curves indicates that T_{2M}^{-2} for H_0 \parallel c,
which is identical to T_{2G}^{-2} (T_{2G} is the Gaussian component), is
substantially enhanced, as seen in the pseudogap regime of the bilayer systems.
Comparison of T_{2M}^{-2} between H_0 \parallel c and H_0 \perp c indicates
that this enhancement is caused by electron spin correlations between the inner

with non-restricted VC auctions, in which the buyers restrict themselves to
bids on bundles in $\Sigma$, because it is rational for them to do so. That is,
it may be that when the buyers report their valuation of the bundles in

Relativity of scalar-tensor gravity theories defined by an arbitrary coupling
function $\alpha$ (in the Einstein frame). We show that, in general, the
evolution of the scalar field $(\phi)$ is governed by two opposite mechanisms:
an attraction mechanism which tends to drive scalar-tensor models toward
Einstein's theory, and a repulsion mechanism which has the contrary effect. The
attraction mechanism dominates the recent epochs of the universe evolution if,
and only if, the scalar field and its derivative satisfy certain boundary
conditions. Since these conditions for convergence toward general relativity
depend on the particular scalar-tensor theory used to describe the universe
evolution, the nucleosynthesis bounds on the present value of the coupling
function, $\alpha_0$, strongly differ from some theories to others. For
example, in theories defined by $\alpha \propto \mid\phi\mid$ analytical
estimates lead to very stringent nucleosynthesis bounds on $\alpha_0$
($\lesssim 10^{-19}$). By contrast, in scalar-tensor theories defined by
$\alpha \propto \phi$ much larger limits on $\alpha_0$ ($\lesssim 10^{-7}$) are
found.

neutrino telescopes such as AMANDA/IceCube, ANTARES, Baikal, and RICE have an
opportunity to search for black hole signatures. Black hole production in the
scattering of ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos on nucleons in the ice or water
may initiate cascades and through-going muons with distinct characteristics

of neutrino telescopes to black hole production and compare it to the one

ones from the air shower facilities Fly's Eye and AGASA. In the optimistic case
that a ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrino flux significantly higher than the one

of (SU(2))^3 to SU(2)_{diag} reduces the SU(2) coupling constant, at
unification, by a factor of 1/\sqrt{3}, so that the ratio of the SU(3) and
SU(2)_{diag} coupling constants, at unification, is equal to the ratio observed
at about 1 TeV. By choosing a suitable alignment of U(1)_Y, and introducing a
generalization of the CKM matrix, the U(1)_Y coupling constants of the observed
fermions, at unification, can also be arranged to have the ratios, to the SU(3)
coupling constant, that are observed at about 1 TeV. This suggests a model of
Heterotic M-Theory, with a standard embedding of the spin connection in one of
the E8s, but with the visible sector now having the E8 that is unbroken at
unification. The universe is pictured as a thick pipe, where the long direction
of the pipe represents the four extended dimensions, the circumference
represents a compact six-manifold, and the radial direction represents the
eleventh dimension. The inner radius of the pipe is about 10^{-19} metres, and
the outer radius of the pipe is about 10^{-14} metres. We live on the inner
surface of the pipe. The low-energy generation structure and the high mass of
the top quark follow from the breaking pattern, and gravity and the Yang-Mills
interactions are unified at about 1 TeV. Parity breaking must occur
spontaneously in four dimensions, rather than being inherited from ten
dimensions. The stability of the proton might be correlated with the entries in

The two phase transitions correspond to two distinct mechanisms by which these
condensations can occur. The first (non-conventional) Bose condensation is
mediated by a zero-mode interaction term in the Hamiltonian. The second is a
transition due to saturation quite similar to the conventional Bose-Einstein
(BE) condensation in the ideal Bose gas. Due to repulsive interaction in
non-zero modes the model manifests a generalized type III, i.e., non-extensive
BE condensation. Our main result is that, as in the ideal Bose gas, the
conventional condensation is accompanied by a loss of strong equivalence of the
canonical and grand canonical ensembles whereas the non-conventional one, due
to the interaction, does not break the equivalence of ensembles. It is also
interesting to note that the type of (generalized) condensate, I, II, or III
(in the terminology of van den Berg, Lewis and Pule), has no effect on the
equivalence of ensembles. These results are proved by computing the generating
functional of the cyclic representation of the Canonical Commutation Relation

  It is worth noticing that general undirected graphs are associated with (not

from ambient high-temperature plasma. The values of amplitude of such wave
appear to be compatible with the measurements of those in-plasma HF electric
fields in tokamak T-10 and a gaseous Z-pinch which give observable Stark
broadening of hydrogen spectral lines.

is proven to be lower bounded by 1 - exp [-n E(R)+ o(n)] for some function E(R)
on noisy quantum channels that are subject to not necessarily independent
errors. The E(R) is positive below some threshold R', which implies R' is a
lower bound on the quantum capacity. This work is an extension of the author's
previous works [M. Hamada, Phys. Rev. A, 65, 052305, 2002 (e-Print
quant-ph/0109114, LANL, 2001), and M. Hamada, submitted to IEEE Trans. Inf.
Theory, 2002 (e-Print quant-ph/0112103, LANL, 2001)], which presented the bound
for channels subject to independent errors, or channels modeled as tensor
products of copies of a completely positive linear map. The relation of the
channel class treated in this paper to those in the previous works are similar
to that of Markov chains to sequences of independent identically distributed
random variables.

We introduce a classification of correlations based on the concept of
non-separability, which is different {\em a priori} from the concept of
entanglement. Generalizing a result of Svetlichny [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 35} (1987)
3066] on 3-particle correlations, we find an inequality for $n$-particle
correlations that holds under the most general separability condition and that
is violated by some quantum-mechanical states.
