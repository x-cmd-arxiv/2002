the neutron star compactness, the observer's viewing angle, and the size of the

weakly or strongly energy-dependent pulse profiles and may introduce phase lags
between different energy bands; (iii) the non-radial beaming pattern can give
rise to high pulsed fractions even for very relativistic neutron stars; (iv)
the pulsed fraction may not vary monotonically with neutron star compactness;
(v) the pulsed fraction does not decrease monotonically with the size of the

30 Myr old burst of star formation. The observed colors of both blue and red
stars in SagDIG are best explained by introducing a differential reddening
scenario in which internal dust extinction affects the star forming regions.
Adopting a low reddening for the red giants, $E(B-V) = 0.07 \pm 0.02$, gives
[Fe/H]=$-2.1 \pm 0.2$ for the mean stellar metallicity, a value consistent with
the [O/H] abundance measured in the HII regions. This revised metallicity,

interaction for arbitrarily given radial and latitudinal gradients of the
rotation rate. In ""traditional approximation"" the angular parts of the
eigenfunctions are described by Laplace's tidal equation generalized here to
take into account differential rotation. From a qualitative analysis of
Laplace's tidal equation the sufficient condition for the formation of the
dynamic shear latitudinal Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (LKHI) is obtained. The
exact solutions of Laplace's equation for low frequencies and rigid rotation
are obtained. There exists only a retrograde wave spectrum in this ideal case.
The modes are subdivided into two branches: fast and slow modes. The long fast
waves carry energy opposite to the rotation direction, while the shorter
slow-mode group velocity is in the azimuthal plane along the direction of
rotation. The eigenfuncions are expressed by Jacobi's polynomials which are
polynomials of higher order than the Legendre's for spherical harmonics. The

which are produced in pairs at the $\Upsilon(4S)$, is fully reconstructed in
the CP decay modes $J/\psi K^0_S$, $\psi(2S) K^0_S$, $\chi_{c1} K^0_S$, $J/\psi

its decay, mainly with the charge of identified leptons and kaons. The proper
time elapsed between the decays is determined by measuring the distance between
the decay vertices. A maximum-likelihood fit to this flavor eigenstate sample
finds $\Delta m_d = 0.516\pm 0.016 {\rm (stat)} \pm 0.010 {\rm (syst)} {\rm

a simultaneous maximum-likelihood fit to the time-difference distribution of

Polyakov loop. From the effective potential for the Polyakov loop, its mass
just below the confinement temperature T_c is in between the vacuum masses of
the pion and that of the kaon. Therefore, due to phase-space restrictions the
number of produced kaons is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than that of
produced pions, in agreement with recent results from collisions of gold ions
at the BNL-RHIC. From its mass, we estimate that the Polyakov loop condensate
is characterized by a (spatial) correlation scale of 1/m_\ell ~ 1/2 fm. For
systems of deconfined matter of about that size, the free energy may not be
dominated by a condensate for the Polyakov loop, and so the process of
hadronization may be qualitatively different as compared to large systems. In
that vein, experimental data on hadron abundance ratios, for example K/pi, in
high-multiplicity pp events at high energies should be very interesting.

to $\tan\beta \sim m_t(M_Z)/m_b(M_Z) \sim 50$ can nullify these $t, b$, $\tau$

predicting fermion masses, we use the constraint of Yukawa unification and the
observed values $M_t, m_b(m_b), M_\tau$ to constrain SUSY parameter space. We
find a narrow region survives for $\mu > 0$ with $\mu, M_{1/2} << m_{16}$, $A_0

unpolarized fragmentation function and the transverse momentum distribution of
a produced hadron, both of which are described reasonably well. In the case of
semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering, our estimate of the Collins function
in connection with the transversity distribution gives rise to a transverse

for temporal-gauge QCD entirely in terms of gauge-invariant fields, calculate
the commutation rules for these fields, and compare them to earlier work on
Coulomb-gauge QCD. We also discuss multiplicities of gauge-invariant
temporal-gauge fields that belong to different topological sectors and that, in
previous work, were shown to be based on the same underlying gauge-dependent
temporal-gauge fields. We relate these multiplicities of gauge-invariant fields
to Gribov copies. We argue that Gribov copies appear in the temporal gauge, but
not when the theory is represented in terms of gauge-dependent fields and
Gauss's law is left unimplemented. There are Gribov copies of the

$v_{{\scriptsize{f}}}\sim U/\log(U)$ is predicted. The large scale of the
velocity field mainly rules the front speed behavior even in the presence of
smaller scales. In the unsteady (time-periodic) case, the front speed displays
a phase-locking on the flow frequency and, albeit the Lagrangian dynamics is
chaotic, chaos in front dynamics only survives for a transient. Asymptotically
the front evolves periodically and chaos manifests only in the spatially
wrinkled structure of the front.

As was found from similar data at sqrt(s_NN) = 130 GeV, the data can be equally
well described by parton saturation models and two-component fits which include
contributions that scale as Npart and the number of binary collisions, Ncoll.
We compare the data at the two energies by means of the ratio R(200/130) of the
charged particle multiplicity for the two different energies as a function of
<Npart>. For events with <Npart>>100$, we find that this ratio is consistent
with a constant value of 1.14+-0.01(stat.)+-0.05(syst.).

Surface force measurements from different laboratories show that the return to
this relaxed structure after the compression is released can be slowed to the
scale of tens of minutes and that the recovery time grows rapidly with
molecular weight. We argue that the arrested state of the free layer before
relaxation can be described as a Guiselin brush structure1, in which the
surface excess lies at heights of the order of the layer thickness, unlike an
adsorbed layer. This brush structure predicts an exponential falloff of the
force at large distance with a decay length that varies as the initial
compression distance to the 6/5 power. This exponential falloff is consistent
with surface force measurements. We propose a relaxation mechanism that
accounts for the increase in relaxation time with chain length.

indeed, the system appears to flop at a frequency being formally infinity that,
