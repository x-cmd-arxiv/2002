examined. The flows are generally referred to as ``convection-dominated,'' and
are characterized by inward transport of angular momentum by thermal convection
and outward viscous transport, vanishing mass accretion, and vanishing local
energy dissipation. We examine the viability of these ideas by explicitly
calculating the leading order angular momentum transport of axisymmetric modes
in magnetized, differentially rotating, stratified flows. The modes are
destabilized by the generalized magnetorotational instability. There are no
inward transporting modes at all unless the magnitude of the (imaginary) Brunt
frequency is comparable to the epicyclic frequency, a condition requiring
substantial levels of dissipation. When inward transporting modes do exist,
they appear at long wavelengths, unencumbered by magnetic tension. Moreover,
very general thermodynamic principles prohibit the complete recovery of
irreversible dissipative energy losses, a central feature of
convection-dominated models. Dissipation of the free energy of differential
rotation inevitably requires outward angular momentum transport. Our results
are in good agreement with global MHD simulations, which find significant
levels of outward transport and energy dissipation, whether or not
destabilizing entropy gradients are present.

interpretations of the soft excess range from intrinsic thermal emission from

indicate that, while broad-line AGN trace a metallicity--luminosity power law
with an index of ~0.2, NLS1s deviate significantly from this relationship at
low luminosities. Adopting the HF93 method based on the N V/C IV line ratio, we
find that NLS1 metallicities are similar to those of some high-redshift
high-luminosity quasars. We also examined the N IV]/C IV line ratio and
compared it with N V/C IV in a sample of 30 sources including several NLS1s. We
find that the two do not give a consistent answer regarding the N/C abundance
ratio. This result is marginal because of the quality of the data. We suggest
two alternative explanations to these results: 1) The HF93
metallicity--luminosity dependence is not a simple two-parameter dependence and
there is an additional hidden variable in this relationship that has not yet
been discovered. The additional parameter may be the accretion rate, the age of
the central stellar cluster or, perhaps, something else. 2) The strong line
ratios involving N V 1240A suggested by HF93 are not adequate metallicity

of equivariant coherent sheaves on the cotangent bundle to the flag variety of
a simple algebraic group and a (quotient of) the category of constructible
sheaves on the affine flag variety of the Langlands dual group. Below we prove
certain properties of this equivalence; provide a similar ``Langlands dual''
description for the category of equivariant coherent sheaves on the nilpotent
cone; and deduce some conjectures by Lusztig and Ostrik.

result, we determine the possibilities for such embeddings except for the
remaining 21 nonsingular toric Fano 4-folds.

polynomial to give an obstruction to a knot's being a C-boundary in a strictly
pseudoconvex S. We make several conjectures.

  free networks","5 pages, 3 figures. Submitted to Phys. Rev. Lett",,,,"nlin.AO cond-mat.dis-nn",,"  As a model of evolving networks, we study coupled logistic maps on scale free
networks. For small coupling strengths nodes show turbulent behavior but form
phase synchronized clusters as coupling increases. We identify two different
ways of cluster formation. For small coupling strengths we get {\it
self-organized clusters} which have mostly intra-cluster couplings and for
large coupling strengths there is a crossover and reorganization to {\it driven
clusters} which have mostly inter-cluster couplings. In the novel driven
synchronization the nodes of one cluster are driven by those of the others.

studied: For $f: [0, +\infty) \longrightarrow (0, +\infty)$ convex,
sufficiently smooth, and vanishing at infinity, let the billiard table be
defined by $Q$, the planar domain delimited by the positive $x$-semiaxis, the
positive $y$-semiaxis, and the graph of $f$.
  For a large class of $f$ we proved that the billiard map was hyperbolic.
Furthermore we gave an example of a family of $f$ that makes this map ergodic.
Here we extend the latter result to a much wider class of functions.

leading to the dynamical collapse of the statevector, white noise stochastic
processes with non white ones. We prove that such a modification can be
consistently performed without altering the most interesting features of the
previous models. One of the reasons to discuss this matter derives from the
desire of being allowed to deal with physical stochastic fields, such as the
gravitational one, which cannot give rise to white noises. From our point of
view the most relevant motivation for the approach we propose here derives from
the fact that in relativistic models the occurrence of white noises is the main
responsible for the appearance of untractable divergences. Therefore, one can
hope that resorting to non white noises one can overcome such a difficulty. We
investigate stochastic equations with non white noises, we discuss their
reduction properties and their physical implications. Our analysis has a
precise interest not only for the above mentioned subject but also for the
general study of dissipative systems and decoherence.
