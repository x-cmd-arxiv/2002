light curves with the XMM-Newton Optical Monitor and from ground-based
observations. Our analysis of the X-ray and optical light curves allows us to
constrain physical and geometrical parameters of the accretion regions and
derive orbital parameters and eclipse ephemerides of the systems. For WW Hor we
directly measure horizontal and vertical temperature variations in the
accretion column. From comparisons with previous observations we find that
changes in the accretion spot longitude are correlated with the accretion rate.
For DP Leo the shape of the hard X-ray light curve is not as expected for
optically thin emission, showing the importance of optical depth effects in the
post-shock region. We find that the spin period of the white dwarf is slightly
shorter than the orbital period and that the orbital period is decreasing
faster than expected for energy loss by gravitational radiation alone.

is a member of the blazar class of AGN. The 5-GHz radio flux density of this

binary star systems with constant rest masses. This computation has been
carried out by using the numerical scheme which is different from the scheme
based on the conformally flat assumption about the space. Stars are assumed to
be polytropes with polytropic indices of N=0.5, N=1.0, and N=1.5. Since we have
computed binary star sequences with a constant rest mass, they provide
approximate evolutionary tracks of binary star systems. For relatively stiff
equations of state (N < 1.0), there appear turning points along the
quasiequilibrium sequences plotted in the angular momentum -- angular velocity
plane. Consequently secular instability against exciting internal motion sets
in at those points. Qualitatively, these results agree with those of Baumgarte
et al. who employed the conformally flat condition. We further discuss the
effect of different equations of state and different strength of gravity by
introducing two kinds of dimensionless quantities which represent the angular
momentum and the angular velocity. Strength of gravity is renormalized in these
quantities so that the quantities are transformed to values around unity.
Therefore we can clearly see relations among quasiequilibrium sequences for a
wide variety of strength of gravity and for different compressibility.

selfgravity if heated solely by orbital dissipation. Such disks might be
expected to form stars rather than accrete onto the black hole. The arguments
leading to this conclusion are reviewed. Conversion of a part of the gas into
high-mass stars or stellar-mass black holes, and the release of energy in these
objects by fusion or accretion, may help to stabilize the remaining gas. If the
disk extends beyond a parsec, however, more energy is probably required for
stability than is available by turning half the gas into high-mass stars. Small
black holes are perhaps marginally viable energy sources, with important
implications (not pursued here) for the QSO spectral energy distribution, the
metallicity of the gas, microlensing of QSO disks, and perhaps
gravitational-wave searches. Other possible palliatives for selfgravity include
accretion driven by nonviscous torques that allow near-sonic accretion speeds
and hence lower surface densities for a given mass accretion rate. All such
modes of accretion face major theoretical difficulties, and in any case merely
postpone selfgravity. Alternatively, thin disks may not exist beyond a thousand
Schwarzshild radii or so (0.01 parsec), in which case QSOs must be fueled by
gas with small specific angular momentum.

generalizations of the instantaneous Newtonian gravitational potential, and in
terms of multipole moments of the system and their time derivatives. All

constraint is given. The analysis utilizes the recently discovered region of
the parameter space of models with gaugino mass nonuniversalities where large
negative supersymmetric corrections to the b quark mass appear to allow
$b-\tau$ unification for a positive $\mu$ sign consistent with the $b\to
s+\gamma$ and $g_{\mu}-2$ constraints. In the present analysis we use the
revised theoretical determination of $a_{\mu}^{SM}$ ($a_{\mu}= (g_{\mu}-2)/2$)
in computing the difference $a_{\mu}^{exp}-a_{\mu}^{SM}$ which takes account of
a reevaluation of the light by light contribution which has a positive sign.
The analysis shows that the region of the parameter space with
nonuniversalities of the gaugino masses which allows for unification of Yukawa
couplings also contains regions which allow satisfaction of the relic density
constraint. Specifically we find that the lightest neutralino mass consistent
with the relic density constraint, $b\tau$ unification for SU(5) and $b-t-\tau$
unification for SO(10) in addition to other constraints lies in the region
below 80 GeV. An analysis of the maximum and the minimum neutralino-proton
scalar cross section for the allowed parameter space including the effect of a
new determination of the pion-nucleon sigma term is also given. It is found

by a degree two class. We assume the fixed point set is isolated; however the
