  the 199th AAS meeting 10 Jan 2002",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The observation of SN 1997ff at redshift 1.7 has been claimed to refute
alternative models such as grey dust or evolution for the faintness of distant
supernovae, leaving only an accelerating Universe as a viable model. However, a
very simple one parameter evolution model, with the peak luminosity varying as
an exponential function of cosmic time, converts the flux vs. distance law of
the critical density matter-dominated model into that of the concordance
Omega_matter = 0.3 flat vacuum-dominated model with an error no larger than
0.03 mag over the range 0-2 in redshift. A grey dust model that matches this
accuracy can easily be contrived but it still fails by overproducing the far-IR
background or distorting the CMB. Models that involve oscillation between
photons and axions could emulate an exponential function of cosmic time without
violating these background constraints. Clearly a better and well-tested
understanding of the Type Ia supernova explosion mechanism and the origin of
the correlation between the decay rate and luminosity is needed before any
effort to reduce statistical errors in the supernova Hubble diagram to very
small levels.

that multiple imaging results from strong lensing by individual galaxies. We
model galaxies as nonsingular isothermal spheres, and take into account the
finite angular size of the sources. Our model neglects the contribution of the
background matter distribution, and assumes that lensing is entirely caused by
galaxies. To test the validity of this assumption, we performed a series of
ray-tracing experiments to study the effect of the background matter on the
distribution of image separations. The analytical model predicts that the
distributions of image separations are virtually indistinguishable for flat,
cosmological constant models with different values of Omega_0. For models with
no cosmological constant, the distributions of image separations do depend upon
Omega_0, but this dependence is weak. We conclude that while the number of
multiple-imaged sources can put strong constraints on the cosmological
parameters, the distribution of image separations does not constrain the
cosmological models in any significant way, and mostly provides constraints on
the structure of the galaxies responsible for lensing.

consistent with the Ward-Takahashi identities.
  Using the one-loop $\bar{\rm MS}$ gauge coupling of the truncated KK
effective theory which has a nontrivial ultraviolet fixed point (UV-FP) $g_*$
for the (dimensionless) bulk gauge coupling ${\hat g}$, we find that there
exists a critical number of flavors, $N_f^{\rm crit}$ ($\simeq 4.2, 1.8$ for
$D=6, 8$ for SU(3) gauge theory): For $N_f > N_f^{\rm crit}$, the dynamical
chiral symmetry breaking takes place not only in the ``strong-coupling phase''
(${\hat g} >g_*$) but also in the ``weak-coupling phase'' (${\hat g} <g_*$)
when the cutoff is large enough. For $N_f < N_f^{\rm crit}$, on the other hand,
only the strong-coupling phase is a broken phase and we can formally define a
continuum (infinite cutoff) limit, so that the physics is insensitive to the
cutoff in this case.
  We also perform a similar analysis using the one-loop ``effective gauge
coupling''. We find the $N_f^{\rm crit}$ turns out to be a value similar to
that of the $\bar{\rm MS}$ case, notwithstanding the enhancement of the
coupling compared with that of the $\bar{\rm MS}$.

which has an almost forbidden state, SigmaN(T=3/2)3s1. In order to see what
kinds of effects are important to reproduce the short-range repulsion in the

one-gluon-exchange potential and the normalization separately. It is clarified
that the gluon exchange constructs the short-range repulsion in the NN1s0 while
the quark Pauli-blocking effect governs the feature of the repulsive behavior

nonstandard contributions of the top-Yukawa coupling and heavy colored fermions
other than the top quark. In order to estimate the contribution of colorons, we
derive the low-energy effective theory by eliminating colorons by using the
equation of motion for colorons. We replace the composite operator (\bar{q}_L
t_R)(\bar{t}_R q_L) in the effective theory by the composite Higgs operator. We
then obtain the effective gluon-gluon-Higgs (ggH-) operator induced by colorons
and find that its coefficient (A_{col}) is proportional to m_{dyn}^2/M^2, where
M and m_{dyn} denote the coloron mass and the mass dynamically generated by
colorons, respectively. The contribution of colorons A_{col} becomes comparable
to the top-loop effect A_{top} for M=O(1TeV) and m_{dyn}=O(0.6TeV). Such a
large dynamical mass can be realized in top-seesaw (TSS) models consistently
with the experimental value of the top quark mass (m_t^{exp}), while the
dynamical mass itself is adjusted to m_t^{exp} in topcolor assisted technicolor
models (TC2). We find that the coloron contribution A_{col} can be sizable in a
certain class of TSS models: the contribution of colorons (the top-loop) is
dominant in the real (imaginary) part of the H->gg amplitude for the Higgs
boson mass m_H of the order of 1 TeV. On the other hand, enhancement of the
top-Yukawa coupling becomes important in TC2. We can observe signatures of the
Higgs boson in TC2 with m_H \sim 200 GeV even at the Tevatron Run II as well as

  systems","13 pages",,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP",,"  We provide geometric quantization of a completely integrable Hamiltonian
system in the action-angle variables around an invariant torus with respect to
the angle polarization. The carrier space of this quantization is the
pre-Hilbert space of smooth complex functions on the torus. A Hamiltonian of a
completely integrable system in this carrier space has a countable spectrum. If
it is degenerate, its eigenvalues are countably degenerate. We study
nonadiabatic perturbations of this Hamiltonian by a term depending on classical
time-dependent parameters. It is originated by a connection on the parameter
space, and is linear in the temporal derivatives of parameters. One can choose
it commuting with a degenerate Hamiltonian of a completely integrable system.
Then the corresponding evolution operator acts in the eigenspaces of this
Hamiltonian, and is an operator of parallel displacement along a curve in the
parameter space.

  Rochester Conference on Coherence and Quantum Optics (June 13-16, 2001). To
  appear in the proceedings of CQO8 (Plenum, 2002)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Semiclassical catastrophes in the dynamics of a quantum rotor (molecule)
driven by a strong time-varying field are considered. We show that for strong
enough fields, a sharp peak in the rotor angular distribution can be achieved
via time-domain focusing phenomenon, followed by the formation of angular
rainbows and glory-like angular structures. Several scenarios leading to the
enhanced angular squeezing are proposed that use specially designed and
optimized sequences of pulses. The predicted effects can be observed in many
processes, ranging from molecular alignment (orientation) by laser fields to
heavy-ion collisions, and the squeezing of cold atoms in a pulsed optical
lattice.
