contribute to the line emission. Two different foreground clouds are detected,
an envelope/disk system and a dense ridge of HCO+ rich material. The latter two
components are spatially separated in millimeter interferometer maps. We
analyze the envelope/disk system by using inside-out collapse and flared disk
models. The disk is in a relatively face-on orientation (<60 degrees), which
explains many of the remarkable observational features of Elias 29, such as its
flat SED, its brightness in the near infrared, the extended components found in
speckle interferometry observations, and its high velocity molecular outflow.
It cannot account for the ices seen along the line of sight, however. A small
fraction of the ices is present in a (remnant) envelope of mass 0.12-0.33 Msun,
but most of the ices (~70%) are present in cool (T<40 K) quiescent foreground
clouds. This explains the observed absence of thermally processed ices
(crystallized H2O) toward Elias 29. Nevertheless, the temperatures could be
sufficiently high to account for the low abundance of apolar (CO, N2, O2) ices.
This work shows that it is crucial to obtain spectrally and spatially resolved
information from single-dish and interferometric molecular gas observations in
order to determine the nature of protostars and to interpret infrared ISO
satellite observations of ices and silicates along a pencil beam.

black hole binaries in galactic nuclei. In hierarchical galaxy formation
models, the most common binaries are likely to arise from minor galactic
mergers, and have unequal mass black holes. Once such a binary becomes embedded
in an accretion disk at a separation of the order of 0.1 pc, the merger
proceeds in two distinct phases. During the first phase, the loss of orbital
angular momentum to the gaseous disk shrinks the binary on a timescale of ~10
Myr. The accretion rate onto the primary black hole is not increased, and can
be substantially reduced, during this disk-driven migration. At smaller
separations, gravitational radiation becomes the dominant angular momentum loss
process, and any gas trapped inside the orbit of the secondary is driven
inwards by the inspiralling black hole. The implied accretion rate just prior
to coalescence exceeds the Eddington limit, so the final merger is likely to
occur within a common envelope formed from the disrupted inner disk, and be
accompanied by high velocity (~10,000 km/s) outflows.

\AA, and with \FUSE from 900--1180 \AA. Emission in 143 Lyman-band H$_2$ lines
representing 19 progressions dominates the spectral region from 1250--1650 \AA.
The total H$_2$ emission line flux is $1.94 \times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to $1.90\times10^{-4}$ $L_\odot$ at TW Hya's
distance of 56 pc. A broad stellar \Lya line photoexcites the H$_2$ from
excited rovibrational levels of the ground electronic state to excited
electronic states. The \ion{C}{2} 1335 \AA doublet, \ion{C}{3} 1175 \AA\
multiplet, and \ion{C}{4} 1550 \AA doublet also electronically excite H$_2$.
The velocity shift of the H$_2$ lines is consistent with the photospheric
radial velocity of TW Hya, and the emission is not spatially extended beyond
the $0\farcs05$ resolution of \textit{HST}. The H$_2$ lines have an intrinsic
FWHM of $11.91\pm0.16$ \kms. One H$_2$ line is significantly weaker than
predicted by this model because of \ion{C}{2} wind absorption. We also do not
observe any H$_2$ absorption against the stellar \Lya profile. From these
results, we conclude that the H$_2$ emission is more consistent with an origin
in a disk rather than in an outflow or circumstellar shell. We also analyze the
hot accretion-region lines (e.g., \ion{C}{4}, \ion{Si}{4}, \ion{O}{6}) of TW
Hya, which are formed at the accretion shock, and discuss some reasons why Si
lines appear significantly weaker than other TR region lines.

spatial structure and the temporal evolution of the nebula. These equations are
then used to obtain the migration rate of the planet in the planetesimal disc
and to study how the migration rate depends on the disc mass, on its time
evolution and on some values of the dimensionless viscosity parameter alpha. We
find that planets that are embedded in planetesimal discs, having total mass of
10^{-4}-0.1 M_{\odot}, can migrate inward a large distance for low values of
alpha (e.g., alpha \simeq 10^{-3}-10^{-2}) and/or large disc mass and can
survive only if the inner disc is truncated or because of tidal interaction
with the star. Orbits with larger $a$ are obtained for smaller value of the
disc mass and/or for larger values of alpha. This model may explain several
orbital features of the recently discovered giant planets orbiting nearby
stars.

correlate for local star forming galaxies and that this correlation is

75 % of the ISOCAM galaxies are found to belong to the class of luminous
infrared galaxies (L[IR] >= 10^11 Lsol), with star formation rates of the order
of ~ 100 Msol/yr. The cross-correlation with the deepest X-ray surveys from the
Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories in the HDFN and Lockman Hole respectively,
indicates that at most 20 % of the 15 microns integrated galaxy light is due to
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) unless a large population of AGNs was missed by
Chandra and XMM-Newton. The contribution of ISOCAM galaxies to the peak of the
cosmic infrared background (CIRB) at 140 microns was computed from the MIR-FIR
correlations for star forming galaxies and from the spectral energy
distribution of the Seyfert 2, NGC 1068, for AGNs. We find that the galaxies
unveiled by ISOCAM surveys are responsible for the bulk of the CIRB, i.e
(16+/-5) nW/m^2/Hz as compared to the (25+/-7) nW/m^2/Hz measured with the COBE
satellite, with less than 10 % due to AGNs. Since the CIRB contains most of the

that a large fraction of present-day stars must have formed during a dusty

sufficiently close to the center to create a strong central concentration,

  More violent evolution can take place during interactions, so that some disc
substructures can be either formed or destroyed in a time scale which is small

describe thermodynamic properties of the soliton liquid in the incommensurate

fluctuations and extend to finite temperatures the results obtained by C.B.
Hanna, A.H. MacDonald and S.M. Girvin [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 63}, 125305 (2001)].
In addition we calculate the specific heat of the system.
  While the results obtained for the sine-Gordon model are available in a
temperature interval $(0,T_c)$, where $T_c=8\pi \rho_s$, $\rho_s$ the
pseudospin stiffness, they can be applied in the bilayer system up to
temperatures $3T_{\rm BKT}$, where $T_{\rm BKT}=\pi\rho_s/2$ is the vortex
mediated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature. Above this
temperature the operators $\cos\beta \phi$ and $\cos(2\pi \vartheta/\beta)$ are
both relevant and the system is in a phase with coexisting order parameters.
$\vartheta$ is the dual field of $\phi$ and $\beta$ is the sine-Gordon coupling
constant. We provide numerical estimates for thermodynamic quantities for the
range of parameters relevant for GaAs.

should that return depend upon other people's behavior? What principles can you
use to answer these questions? In this paper, we approach these topics by
exploring the consequences of two simple hypotheses about risk.
  The first is a common-sense invariance principle: assets with the same
perceived risk must have the same expected return. The second hypothesis
concerns the perception of time. We conjecture that in times of speculative
excitement, short-term investors may instinctively imagine stock prices to be
evolving in a time measure different from that of calendar time. They may
instead perceive and experience the risk and return of a stock in intrinsic
time, a dimensionless time scale that counts the number of trading
opportunities that occur.
  The most noteworthy result is that, in the short-term, a stock's trading
frequency affects its expected return. We show that short-term stock
speculators will expect returns proportional to the temperature of a stock,
where temperature is defined as the product of the stock's traditional
volatility and the square root of its trading frequency. We hope that this
model will have some relevance to the behavior of investors expecting
inordinate returns in highly speculative markets.

is that they are conventional superconductors where the pairing occurs between
weakly interacting quasiparticles, which stand in one-to-one correspondence
with the electrons in ordinary metals - although the theory has to be pushed to
its limit. An alternative view is that the electrons organize into collective
textures (e.g. charge and spin stripes) which cannot be mapped onto the
electrons in ordinary metals. The phase diagram, a complex function of various
parameters (temperature, doping and magnetic field), should then be approached
using quantum field theories of objects such as textures and strings, rather
than point-like electrons. In an external magnetic field, magnetic flux
penetrates type-II superconductors via vortices, each carrying one flux
quantum. The vortices form lattices of resistive material embedded in the
non-resistive superconductor and can reveal the nature of the ground state -
e.g. a conventional metal or an ordered, striped phase - which would have
appeared had superconductivity not intervened. Knowledge of this ground state
clearly provides the most appropriate starting point for a pairing theory. Here
we report that for one high-Tc superconductor, the applied field which imposes
the vortex lattice, also induces antiferromagnetic order. Ordinary
quasiparticle pictures cannot account for the nearly field-independent
antiferromagnetic transition temperature revealed by our measurements.

Unlike previous work on the topic such as that by McAfee and McMillan [1992]

perfect knowledge about the number of colluding agents whose bids are
suppressed by the bidding ring, and indeed even allow for the existence of
multiple cartels. Furthermore, while we treat the association of bidders with
bidding rings as exogenous, we allow bidders to make strategic decisions about
whether to join bidding rings when invited. We identify a bidding ring protocol
that results in an efficient allocation in Bayes{Nash equilibrium, under which
non-colluding agents bid straightforwardly, and colluding agents join bidding
rings when invited and truthfully declare their valuations to the ring center.
We show that bidding rings benefit ring centers and all agents, both members
and non-members of bidding rings, at the auctioneer's expense. The techniques
we introduce in this paper may also be useful for reasoning about other
problems in which agents have asymmetric information about a setting.

intriguing aspects of noncommutative quantum field theories. In this paper the
relation between these two phenomena is explained and established. We start out
by showing that the S-matrix of noncommutative field theories is hermitian
analytic. As a consequence, a noncommutative field theory is unitary if the
discontinuities of its Feynman diagram amplitudes agree with the expressions
calculated using the Cutkosky formulae. These unitarity constraints relate the
discontinuities of amplitudes with physical intermediate states; and allow us
to see how the IR/UV mixing may lead to a breakdown of unitarity. Specifically,
we show that the IR/UV singularity does not lead to the violation of unitarity
in the space-space noncommutative case, but it does lead to its violation in a
space-time noncommutative field theory. As a corollary, noncommutative field
theory without IR/UV mixing will be unitary in both the space-space and
space-time noncommutative case. To illustrate this, we introduce and analyse
the noncommutative Lee model--an exactly solvable quantum field theory. We show
that the model is free from the IR/UV mixing in both the space-space and
space-time noncommutative cases. Our analysis is exact. Due to absence of the
IR/UV mixing one can expect that the theory is unitary. We present some checks
supporting this claim. Our analysis provides a counter example to the generally
held beliefs that field theories with space-time noncommutativity are
non-unitary.

also a challenging problem for direct numerical computation because the VF
dynamics depend on nonlinear coupling of air flow with the response of elastic
channels (VF), which undergo opening and closing, and induce internal flow
separation. A traditional modeling approach makes use of steady flow
approximation or Bernoulli's law which is known to be invalid during VF
opening. We present a new hydrodynamic semi-continuum system for VF motion. The
airflow is modeled by a quasi-one dimensional continuum aerodynamic system, and
the VF by a classical lumped two mass system. The reduced flow system contains
the Bernoulli's law as a special case, and is derivable from the two
dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Since we do not make steady
flow approximation, we are able to capture transients and rapid changes of
solutions, e.g. the double pressure peaks at opening and closing stages of VF
motion consistent with experimental data. We demonstrate numerically that our
system is robust, and models in-vivo VF oscillation more physically. It is also

coil-stretch transition in the polymers. We analyze this transition within a
direct numerical simulation of shear turbulence with an Oldroyd-B model for the
polymer. In the coiled state the lengths of polymers are distributed
algebraically with an exponent alpha=2 gamma-1/De, where gamma is a
characteristic stretching rate of the flow and De the Deborah number. In the
stretched state we demonstrate that the length distribution of the polymers is
limited by the feedback to the flow.

the Hamiltonian that nonlocality of the nonlinearity prevents collapse in,
e.g., Bose-Einstein condensates and optical Kerr media in all physical

completely arbitrary shape. We use variational techniques to find the soliton

wavefunctions are replaced with (state) sections (covariant approach) or
liftings of paths (equivalently: sections along paths) (time-dependent
approach) of a suitably chosen vector bundle over space-time whose (standard)
fibre is the space of the wavefunctions. Now the quantum evolution is described
as a linear transportation of the state sections/liftings in the (total) bundle
space. The equations of these transportations turn to be the bundle versions of
the corresponding relativistic wave equations. Connections between the
(retarded) Green functions of these equations and the evolution operators and
transports are found. Especially the Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations are
considered.
