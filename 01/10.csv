model predicting a first-order kaon-condensate phase transition. We examine the
free energy of droplets of K-matter as the density, temperature, and neutrino
fraction are varied. Langer nucleation rate theory is then used to approximate
the rate at which critical droplets of the new phase are produced by thermal
fluctuations, thus giving an estimate of the time required for the new (mixed)
phase to appear at various densities and various times in the cooling history
of the proto-neutron star. We also discuss the famous difficulty of
""simultaneous weak interactions"" which we connect to the literature on
non-topological solitons. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results
to several phenomenological issues involving neutron star phase transitions.

the low-frequency break seen in the power spectra of BHXRBs in the low state

break' model (where the power-spectral slope flattens to \alpha=1), analogous
to the high-frequency break seen in the high and low-state power spectra of the
classic BHXRB Cyg X-1. Both models provide good fits to the power spectra of
all four AGN. For both models, the characteristic frequency for flattening is
significantly higher in MCG-6-30-15 than in NGC 3516 (by factor ~10) although
both sources have similar X-ray luminosities, suggesting that MCG-6-30-15 has a
lower black hole mass and is accreting at a higher rate than NGC 3516. Assuming
linear scaling of characteristic frequencies with black hole mass, the high
accretion rate implied for MCG-6-30-15 favours the high-frequency break model
for this source and further suggests that MCG-6-30-15 and possibly NGC 5506,

Photometry as well as fluxes of Balmer emissions and of some Fe II emission
lines of CI Cam in quiet state reveal a cyclic variation with the period of
$1100\pm50^d$. The variation like this may be due to an orbital motion in a
wide pair with a giant star companion that exhibits the reflection effect on
its side faced to a compact companion.
  The V-band photometry also confirms the pre-outburst 11.7 day period found by
Miroshnichenko earlier, but with a lower amplitude of 3 per cent. The
possibility of identity of this photometric period with the period of jet's
rotation in the VLA radio map of the object CI Cam was investigated. The radio
map modelling reveals the inclination of the jet rotation axis to the line of

ejection of the jet, $\theta = 7-10^o$, and jet's spatial velocity of
0.23--0.26c.
  Equivalent widths and fluxes of various spectral lines show different
amplitudes of changes during the outburst, and essentially distinct behaviour
in quiescence. Five types of such behaviour were revealed, that indicates the
strong stratification of a gas and dust envelope round the system . The time

balloon-borne microwave telescope with sensitive cryogenic detectors. BOOMERanG
has measured the angular distribution of the Cosmic Microwave Background on
$\sim 3%$ of the sky, with a resolution of $\sim 10$ arcmin and a sensitivity
of $\sim 20 \mu K$ per pixel. The resulting image is dominated by hot and cold
spots with rms fluctuations $\sim 80 \mu K$ and typical size of $\sim 1^o$. The
detailed angular power spectrum of the image features three peaks and two dips
at $\ell = (213^{+10}_{-13}), (541^{+20}_{-32}), (845^{+12}_{-25})$ and $\ell =
(416^{+22}_{-12}), (750^{+20}_{-750})$, respectively. Such very characteristic
spectrum can be explained assuming that the detected structures are the result
of acoustic oscillations in the primeval plasma. In this framework, the
measured pattern constrains the density parameter $\Omega$ to be $0.85 < \Omega
< 1.1$ (95% confidence interval). Other cosmological parameters, like the
spectral index of initial density fluctuations, the density parameter for
baryons, dark matter and dark energy, are detected or constrained by the
BOOMERanG measurements and by other recent CMB anisotropy experiments. When
combined with other cosmological observations, these results depict a new,
consistent, cosmological scenario.

of models combining AGN photoionization and shocks. The results strongly
suggest that the two ionizing mechanisms frequently coexist. The model
sequences obtained by varying the balance between shocks and AGN

[OIII]5007/Hbeta, [OI]6300/Halpha, [NII]6584/Halpha and [SII]6716,6731, the
effect of varying the shock-photoionization balance mimics a variation of the

CIV1549/[CII]2326, the data can only be accounted for if both photoionization
and shocks contribute to the line fluxes. The coexistence of shocks and AGN
photoionization also provides an explanation for the most extreme objects in
the NV1240/HeII1640 vs. NV1240/CIV1549 diagram without requiring largely
super-solar metallicities. In addition, we show that there is a relationship
between the [OII]3727/[OIII]5007 ratio and the radio size in radio galaxies.
This strongly supports the hypothesis that the most compact (< 2kpc) and the
largest (> 150 kpc) sources are dominated by photoionization, while
intermediate-sized radio galaxies are dominated by shocks. We briefly discuss
the possible origin of the relation between the shock-ionization balance and
the radio size.

perpendicular to the magnetic field, whereas it is parallel to the magnetic

produces a change in PA of $90^{\circ}$ across the spectral peak, while FFA
does not result in such a change. We analyzed polarization data from VLA

(r_0/r)^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma=1.69$ and $r_0=3.70 \mpc$. The pairwise peculiar
velocity dispersion $\sigma_{12}(r_p)$ is close to $400 \kms$ at $r_p=3\mpc$
and decreases to about $150 \kms$ at $r_p \approx 0.2 \mpc$. These values are
significantly lower than those obtained from the Las Campanas Redshift Survey,

later on. We have constructed mock samples from N-body simulations with a
cluster-weighted bias and from the theoretically constructed GIF catalog. We
find that the two-point correlation function of the mock galaxies can be
brought into agreemnt with the observed result, but the model does not reduce
the velocity dispersions of galaxies to the level measured in the PSCz data.
Thus we conclude that the peculiar velocity dispersions of the PSCz galaxies
require a biasing model which substantially reduces the peculiar velocity
dispersion on small scales relative to their spatial clustering. The results
imply that either the cosmogony model needs to be revised or the velocity bias
is important for the velocity dispersion of the IRAS galaxies.

bodies orbiting eclipsing binaries. The analysis combines long-term eclipse
timing modulations (light-travel time or LTT effect) with short-term,
high-accuracy astrometry. As an illustration of the method, the results of a
comprehensive study of Hipparcos astrometry and over a hundred years of eclipse
timings of the Algol-type eclipsing binary R Canis Majoris are presented. A
simultaneous solution of the astrometry and the LTTs yields an orbital period
of P_12=92.8+/-1.3 yr, an LTT semiamplitude of 2574+/-57 s, an angular
semi-major axis of a_12=117+/-5 mas, and values of the orbital eccentricity and
inclination of e_12=0.49+/-0.05, and i_12=91.7+/-4.7 deg, respectively.
Adopting the total mass of R CMa of M_12=1.24+/-0.05 Mo, the mass of the third
body is M_3=0.34+/-0.02 Mo and the semi-major axis of its orbit is
a_3=18.7+/-1.7 AU. From its mass, the third body is either a dM3-4 star or,
more unlikely, a white dwarf. With the upcoming microarcsecond-level
astrometric missions, the technique that we discuss can be successfully applied
to detect and characterize long-period planetary-size objects and brown dwarfs
around eclipsing binaries. Possibilities for extending the method to pulsating
variables or stars with transiting planets are briefly addressed.

in accretion discs using the ZEUS-2D hydrodynamics code. The waves are
numerically resolved in the vertical and radial directions. Both vertically
isothermal and thermally stratified accretion discs are considered. The waves
are generated by means of resonant forcing and several forms of forcing are
considered. Compressional motions are taken to be locally adiabatic ($\gamma =
5/3$). Prior to non-linear dissipation, the numerical results are in excellent
agreement with the linear theory of wave channelling in predicting the types of
modes that are excited, the energy flux by carried by each mode, and the
vertical wave energy distribution as a function of radius. In all cases, waves
are excited that propagate on both sides of the resonance (inwards and
outwards). For vertically isothermal discs, non-linear dissipation occurs
primarily through shocks that result from the classical steepening of acoustic
waves. For discs that are substantially thermally stratified, wave channelling
is the primary mechanism for shock generation. Wave channelling boosts the Mach
number of the wave by vertically confining the wave to a small cool region at
the base of the disc atmosphere. In general, outwardly propagating waves with
Mach numbers near resonance ${\cal M}_{\rm r} \ga 0.01$ undergo shocks within a
distance of order the resonance radius.

applied to a large variety of situations in which there is a separation of
time-scales for the different physical processes. Solutions are explicitly
given and discussed for the case when sound propagation and/or self-gravity are
the fastest processes, with cooling, expansion and thermal conduction operating
on slower time-scales. A brief discussion is also added for the solutions in
the cases in which cooling or conduction operate on the fastest time-scale. The
general WKB solution obtained in this paper permits solving the problem of the
effect of thermal conduction and self-gravity on the thermal stability of a
globally cooling and expanding medium. As a result of the analysis, the
critical wavelength (often called Field length) above which cooling makes the
perturbations unstable against the action of thermal conduction is generalized
to the case of an unperturbed background with net cooling. As an astrophysical
application, the generalized Field length is calculated for a hot (10^4 - 10^8
K), optically thin medium (as pertains, for instance, for the hot interstellar
medium of SNRs or superbubbles) using a realistic cooling function and
including a weak magnetic field. The stability domains are compared with the
predictions made on the basis of models for which the background is in thermal
equilibrium. The instability domain of the sound waves, in particular, is seen
to be much larger in the case with net global cooling.

which are in turn steeper than the profiles observed in the centre of some
galaxies; particularly dwarfs and low surface brightness galaxies. The outer
regions of galaxies both as observed and as simulated have density profiles
steeper than the self-similar profile. Nevertheless there appears to be an
intermediate region in most galaxies in which the inverse square behaviour is a
good description. The outer deviations can be explained plausibly in terms of
the transition from a self-gravitating extended halo to a Keplerian flow onto a
dominant central mass (the isothermal distribution can not be complete), but
the inner deviations are more problematic. Rather than attack this question
directly, we use in this paper a novel coarse-graining technique combined with
a shell code to establish both the distribution function associated with the
self-similar density profile and the nature of the possible deviations in the
central regions. In spherical symmetry we find that both in the case of purely
radial orbits and in the case of orbits with non-zero angular momentum the
self-similar density profile should flatten progressively near the centre of
the system. The NFW limit of -1 seems possible. In a section aimed at
demonstrating our technique for a spherically symmetric steady state, we argue
that a Gaussian distribution function is the best approximation near the centre

that to minimize the position uncertainty of a freely falling measuring device

To do this the theory is assumed to be thermalized and to be gravitationally
deformed. BPS saturation in the dynamics of the monopole field is shown to lead
to a suppression of the back reaction due to classical gravity. The classical,
effective description of the gauge theory can be justified for both the regime
of maximal abelian gauge symmetry and the center symmetric phase.

the connection to observables involving a scalar Higgs boson is worked out in

exact multi-loop calculations. As far as physical processes are concerned, we
review the computation of three-loop current correlators in QCD taking into

are considered which contribute to the order $\alpha^2$ QED corrections to the

  fixed; only solvable extensions are considered now. There are also big
  corrections in Section 5 and minor changes throughout the paper",,,,"math.AG math.NT",,"  We develop a new approach to construction of numerical invariants for
ramified coverings of algebraic surfaces of prime characteristic.
  Let A be a two-dimensional regular local ring of prime characteristic p with
algebraically closed residue field. Let L/K be a solvable finite Galois
extension of its fraction field. Let C be a germ of a regular curve on the
spectrum of A which is not a component of the ramification divisor R. Then L/K
determines (up to conjugation) an extension of the function filed of C. This is
an extension of discrete valuation fields with algebaically closed residue
fields, and we consider ramification jumps of this extension. Varying C, we
obtain a collection of data describing the ramification of L/K with respect to
C.
  In the present paper we show that the above mentioned ramification jumps
depend only on the jet of C of certain order, and the upper bound for this
order depends linearly on the order of tangence of C and R. Strictly speaking,
this is done for wild ramification jumps, i.e., for the ramification jumps
divided by the order of tame ramification.
  It would be important to prove a stronger fact: not only the jumps but the
whole ramification filtration is the same when C is running over a jet of
certain order. This statement (for curves transversal to R) is a step in
Deligne's program describing how to compute Euler-Poincare characteristics of
constructible etale sheaves on surfaces. In the present version we prove the
above fact for some class of Galois groups that includes, in particular, all
abelian p-groups.

the eigenstates in a magnetic system, they carry electric current along the

dot) and exterior (anti-dot) states. In the present report we develop a
consistent and practical spectral theory for the edge states encountered in
magnetic billiards. It provides an objective definition for the notion of edge
states, is applicable for interior and exterior problems, facilitates efficient
quantization schemes, and forms a convenient starting point for both the
semiclassical description and the statistical analysis. After elaborating these
topics we use the semiclassical spectral theory to uncover nontrivial spectral
correlations between the interior and the exterior edge states. We show that
they are the quantum manifestation of a classical duality between the
trajectories in an interior and an exterior magnetic billiard.

has radically transformed the methods of statistical inference. What used to be
a small minority of statisticians advocating for the use of priors and a strict
adherence to bayes theorem, it is now becoming the norm across disciplines. The
evolutionary direction is now clear. The trend is towards more realistic,
flexible and complex likelihoods characterized by an ever increasing number of
parameters. This makes the old question of: What should the prior be? to
acquire a new central importance in the modern bayesian theory of inference.
Entropic priors provide one answer to the problem of prior selection. The
general definition of an entropic prior has existed since 1988, but it was not
until 1998 that it was found that they provide a new notion of complete
ignorance. This paper re-introduces the family of entropic priors as minimizers
of mutual information between the data and the parameters, as in
[rodriguez98b], but with a small change and a correction. The general formalism
is then applied to two large classes of models: Discrete probabilistic networks
and univariate finite mixtures of gaussians. It is also shown how to perform
inference by efficiently sampling the corresponding posterior distributions.

Counterpropagating optical fields drive Raman transitions between ground state
sublevels. The Raman fields can be described by an effective two photon field
having wave vector 2 k, where k is the propagation vector of one of the fields.
By combining this Raman field with {\em another} Raman field having propagation
vector -2 k, one, in effect, creates a standing wave Raman field
\label{91}%which whose ``intensity'' varies as $\cos (4 k\cdot r).$ When atoms
move through this standing wave field, atom gratings having period $\lambda /4$
are produced, with the added possibility that the total ground state population
in a given ground state manifold can have $\lambda /8$ periodicity. The
conditions required to produce such gratings are derived. Moreover, it is shown
that even higher order gratings having periodicity smaller than $\lambda /8$
can be produced using a multicolor field geometry involving three (two-photon)
Raman fields. Although most calculations are carried out in the Raman-Nath
approximation, the use of Raman fields to create reduced period optical
lattices is also discussed.

counter-charges, a charged, knotted string evolving along the energy gradient
of electrostatic repulsion would progressively tighten its knotted domain into
a point on a perfectly circular string. However, in the presence of charge
screeningthe self-repelling knotted strings can get stabilised. It is known
that energy functionals in which repulsive forces between repelling charges
grow inversely proportional to the third or higher power of their relative
distance stabilise self-repelling knots. Especially interesting is the case of
the third power since the repulsive energy becomes scale invariant and does not
change upon Moebius transformations (reflections in spheres) of knotted
trajectories. We observe here thatknots minimising their repulsive Moebius
energy show quantization of the energy and writhe (measure of chirality) within
several tested families of knots.
