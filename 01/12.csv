milliseconds, as inferred from the nearly-coherent oscillations observed during
type-I X-ray bursts, the quiescent X-ray luminosity constrains the neutron star
magnetic field strength to less than \sim 10^9 G. If the quiescent emission
originates from the release of thermal energy accumulated through deep crust
heating in the previous accretion phase, then the measured quiescent luminosity
requires a neutron star mass of more than 1.7 M_\odot or a very long outbust
recurrence time (\sim 10^3 yr). The former possibility would be in agreement
with the expectation of the recycling scenario, namely that the neutron star
has accreted a significant amount of mass, enough to spin it up to millisecond

axisymmetric simulations. First, we show that the Hall term has important
effects on the MRI when the temperature and density in the disk is below a few
thousand K and between 10^13 and 10^18 cm^{-3} respectively. Such conditions
can occur in the quiescent phase of dwarf nova disks, or in the inner part
(inside 10 - 100 AU) of protoplanetary disks. When the Hall term is important,
the properties of the MRI are dependent on the direction of the magnetic field
with respect to the angular velocity vector \Omega. If the disk is threaded by
a uniform vertical field oriented in the same sense as \Omega, the axisymmetric
evolution of the MRI is an exponentially growing two-channel flow without
saturation. When the field is oppositely directed to \Omega, however, small
scale fluctuations prevent the nonlinear growth of the channel flow and the MRI
evolves into MHD turbulence. These results are anticipated from the
characteristics of the linear dispersion relation. In axisymmetry on a field
with zero-net flux, the evolution of the MRI is independent of the size of the
Hall term relative to the inductive term. The evolution in this case is
determined mostly by the effect of ohmic dissipation.

least as strong as that seen for the Lyman-break galaxy population and the

clustering is expected to be correspondingly stronger.

CDM cosmologies, and identify the key elements of a scenario that may solve
them. The buildup of angular momentum is modeled via dynamical friction and
tidal stripping in a sequence of mergers. We demonstrate how over-cooling in
incoming halos leads to a transfer of angular momentum from the baryons to the
dark matter, in conflict with observations. By incorporating a simple recipe of
supernova feedback, we are able to solve the problems of angular momentum in
disk formation. Gas removal from the numerous small incoming halos, which merge
to become the low specific angular momentum (j) component of the product,
eliminates the low-j baryons. Heating and puffing-up of the gas in larger
incoming halos, combined with efficient tidal stripping, reduces the angular
momentum loss of baryons due to dynamical friction. Dependence of the feedback
effects on the progenitor halo mass implies that the spin of baryons is
typically higher for lower mass halos. The observed low baryonic fraction in
dwarf galaxies is used to calibrate the characteristic velocity associated with
supernova feedback, yielding ~100 km/s, within the range of theoretical
expectations. We then find that the model naturally produces the observed
distribution of the spin parameter among dwarf and bright disk galaxies, as
well as the j profile inside these galaxies. This suggests that the model
indeed captures the main features of a full scenario for resolving the spin
crisis.

accelerated by supernova shocks, accounting for the observed $^6$Li in such
stars with supernova CRs is more problematic. Here we propose that
gravitational shocks induced by infalling and merging sub-Galactic clumps
during hierarchical structure formation of the Galaxy should dissipate enough
energy at early epochs, and CRs accelerated by such shocks can provide a
natural explanation of the observed $^6$Li. In clear constrast to supernovae,
structure formation shocks do not eject freshly synthesized CNO nor Fe, so that
the only effective production channel at low metallicity is $\alpha-\alpha$
fusion, capable of generating sufficient $^6$Li with no accompanying Be or B
and no direct correspondence with Fe. Correlations between the $^6$Li abundance
and the kinematic properties of the halo stars may also be expected in this
scenario. Further, more extensive observations of $^6$Li in metal-poor halo
stars, e.g. by the Subaru HDS or VLT/UVES, may offer us an invaluable fossil
record of dissipative dynamical processes which occurred during the formation
of our Galaxy.

  Structured Data","Submission to JACM for review. 27 single spaced pages",,,,"cs.CL cs.DS",,"  Information, stored or transmitted in digital form, is often structured.
Individual data records are usually represented as hierarchies of their
elements. Together, records form larger structures. Information processing
applications have to take account of this structuring, which assigns different
semantics to different data elements or records. Big variety of structural
schemata in use today often requires much flexibility from applications--for
example, to process information coming from different sources. To ensure
application interoperability, translators are needed that can convert one
structure into another. This paper puts forward a formal data model aimed at
supporting hierarchical data processing in a simple and flexible way. The model
is based on and extends results of two classical theories, studying finite
string and tree automata. The concept of finite automata and regular languages
is applied to the case of arbitrarily structured tree-like hierarchical data
records, represented as ""structured strings."" These automata are compared with
classical string and tree automata; the model is shown to be a superset of the
classical models. Regular grammars and expressions over structured strings are
introduced. Regular expression matching and substitution has been widely used
for efficient unstructured text processing; the model described here brings the
power of this proven technique to applications that deal with information
trees. A simple generic alternative is offered to replace today's specialised
ad-hoc approaches. The model unifies structural and content transformations,
providing applications with a single data type. An example scenario of how to
build applications based on this theory is discussed. Further research
directions are outlined.

numerically. This analysis extends previous work in two directions: first it
shows results coming from a fully three dimensional simulation (as opposed to
the two dimensional case already studied), and it now includes fermionic as
well as bosonic currents. We confirm that in the case of bosonic currents,
shocks are formed in the magnetic regime and kinks in the electric regime. For
a loop endowed with a fermionic current with zero-mode carriers, we show that
only kinks form along the string worldsheet, therefore making these loops
slightly more stable against charge carrier radiation, the likely outcome of
either shocks or kinks. All these combined effects tend to reduce the number
density of stable loops and contribute to ease the vorton excess problem. As a
bonus, these effects also may provide new ways of producing high energy cosmic

coding of these natural signals face challenges both in the selection of the
signal ensemble and in the analysis of the resulting neural responses. For
zebra finches, naturalistic stimuli can be defined as sounds that they
encounter in a colony of conspecific birds. We assembled an ensemble of these
sounds by recording groups of 10-40 zebra finches, and then analyzed the
response of single neurons in the songbird central auditory area (field L) to
continuous playback of long segments from this ensemble.
  Following methods developed in the fly visual system, we measured the
information that spike trains provide about the acoustic stimulus without any
assumptions about which features of the stimulus are relevant. Preliminary
results indicate that large amounts of information are carried by spike timing,
with roughly half of the information accessible only at time resolutions better
than 10 ms; additional information is still being revealed as time resolution
is improved to 2 ms. Information can be decomposed into that carried by the
locking of individual spikes to the stimulus (or modulations of spike rate) vs.
that carried by timing in spike patterns. Initial results show that in field L,
temporal patterns give at least ~20% extra information. Thus, single central
auditory neurons can provide an informative representation of naturalistic
sounds, in which spike timing may play a significant role.
