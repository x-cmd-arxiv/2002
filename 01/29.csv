halo models with CDM motivated dark matter profiles. The model enables us to
separate between the central galactic and noncentral group/cluster
contributions. We apply the model to the recent SDSS measurements with known
redshifts and luminosities of the lenses. This allows one to accurately model
the mass distribution of a local galaxy population around and above
$L_{\star}$. We find that virial mass of L* galaxy is
M*=(5-10)x10^{11}h^{-1}M_{\sun}, depending on the color of the galaxy. This
value varies significantly with galaxy morphology with M* for late types being
a factor of 10 lower in u', 7 in g' and a factor of 2.5-3 lower in r', i' and
z' relative to early types. Fraction of noncentral galaxies in groups and
clusters is estimated to be below 10% for late types and around 30% for early
types. Using the luminosity dependence of the signal we find that for early
types the virial halo mass M scales with luminosity as M \propto L^1.4 in red
bands above L*. This shows that the virial mass to light ratio is increasing
with luminosity for galaxies above L*, as predicted by theoretical models. The
virial mass to light ratio in i' band is 17(45)hM_{\sun}/L_{\sun} at L* for
late (early) types. Combining this result with cosmological baryon fraction one
finds that 0.7(0.25)h^{-1}\Upsilon_i\Omega_m/12\Omega_b of baryons within the
virial radius are converted to stars at L*, where \Upsilon_i is the stellar
mass to light ratio in i' band. This indicates that both for early and late
type galaxies around L* a significant fraction of all the baryons in the halo
is transformed into stars.

value at the optical radius to the virial radius, v_opt/v_200 \sim 1.8 with
about 20% uncertainty. Such a drop is expected in models in which the halo
profile is very concentrated, so that it declines steeper than isothermal at
large radii. This large drop can be explained as a result of both a
concentrated dark matter profile and a significant stellar contribution to the
rotation velocity at the optical radii. We model the stellar component with a
thin rotationally supported disk or a Hernquist profile and use adiabatic dark
matter response model to place limits on the halo concentration as a function
of the stellar mass to light ratio. For reasonable values of the latter we find
concentrations consistent with CDM predictions, suggesting there is no evidence
for low concentrations for the majority of halos in the universe. We also
discuss the origin of Faber-Jackson relation L \propto sigma^4 in light of L
\propto v_200^2.5 relation found for early type galaxies from galaxy-galaxy
lensing. This leads to a decrease in v_opt/v_{200} with luminosity above L*, so
that at 7L_* the ratio is 1.4. This is expected from the fundamental plane
relation and implies that relations such as Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson are
not simply relations between the mass of dark matter halo and galaxy
luminosity, but are also significantly influenced by the baryonic effects on

  This study doubles the number of main sequence B stars in the LMC with

candidate. Second, the $R^2$ gravity leads to specific near scale-invariant

the kinetic and chemical structure of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We use
three-dimensional Monte Carlo cosmological realizations of a simple linear
peaks model to track the time evolution of such metal-enriched outflows and
their feedback on galaxy formation. We find that at most 30% of the IGM by
volume is enriched to values above 10^-3 solar in models that only include
objects that cool by atomic transitions. The majority of enrichment occurs
relatively early (5 < z < 12) and resulting in a mass-averaged cosmological
metallicity between 10^-3 and 10^-1.5 solar. The inclusion of Population III
objects that cool through H2 line emission has only a minor impact on these
results: increasing the mean metallicity and filling factor by at most a factor
of 1.4, and moving the dawn of the enrichment epoch to a redshift of
approximately 14 at the earliest. Thus enrichment by outflowing galaxies is
likely to have been incomplete and inhomogeneous, biased to the areas near the
starbursting galaxies themselves. Models with a 10% star formation efficiency
can satisfactorily reproduce the nearly constant (2 < z < 5, Z approximately
3.5 x 10^-4 solar) metallicity of the low column density Ly-alpha forest
derived by Songaila (2001), an effect of the decreasing efficiency of metal
loss from larger galaxies. Finally, we show that IGM enrichment is intimately
tied to the ram-pressure stripping of baryons from neighboring perturbations.
This results in the suppression of at least 20% of the dwarf galaxies in the
mass range 10^8.5 to 10^9.5 solar, in all models with filling factors greater
than 2%, and an overall suppression of approximately 50% of dwarf galaxies in

currently not well understood. Afterglow models of synchrotron emission
generated by external shocks in the GRB fireball model predict emission
detectable in the gamma-ray regime ($\gax 25$ keV). In this paper, we present a
temporal and spectral analysis of a subset of BATSE GRBs with smooth extended
emission tails to search for signatures of the ``early high-energy afterglow'',
i.e., afterglow emission that initially begins in the gamma-ray phase and
subsequently evolves into X-Ray, uv, optical, and radio emission as the blast
wave is decelerated by the ambient medium. From a sample of 40 GRBs we find
that the temporal decays are best described with a power-law $\sim t^{\beta}$,
rather than an exponential, with a mean index $<\beta > \approx -2$. Spectral
analysis shows that $\sim 20%$ of these events are consistent with fast-cooling
synchrotron emission for an adiabatic blast wave; three of which are consistent
with the blast wave evolution of a jet, with $F_{\nu} \sim t^{-p}$. This
behavior suggests that, in some cases, the emission may originate from a narrow
jet, possibly consisting of ``nuggets'' whose angular size are less than $1 /
\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the bulk Lorentz factor.

of ""strange"" superconductors, whose challenging behavior does not comply with
the traditional picture of Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS)
superconductivity in regular crystals. In this paper, we propose a theoretical
model that accounts for the strange superconducting properties of either class
of the materials. These properties are considered as interconnected
manifestations of the same phenomenon: We argue that superconductivity occurs
in the both cases because the charge carriers (i.e., electrons or holes)
exchange {\it fracton excitations}, quantum oscillations of fractal lattices
that mimic the complex microscopic organization of the strange superconductors.
For the copper oxides, the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ as
predicted by the fracton mechanism is of the order of $\sim 150$ K. We suggest
that the marginal ingredient of the high-temperature superconducting phase is
provided by fracton coupled holes that condensate in the conducting
copper-oxygen planes owing to the intrinsic field-effect-transistor
configuration of the cuprate compounds. For the gate-induced superconducting
phase in the electron-doped polymers, we simultaneously find a rather modest
transition temperature of $\sim (2-3)$ K owing to the limitations imposed by
the electron tunneling processes on a fractal geometry. We speculate that
hole-type superconductivity observes larger onset temperatures when compared to
its electron-type counterpart. This promises an intriguing possibility of the
high-temperature superconducting states in hole-doped complex materials. A
specific prediction of the present study is universality of ac conduction for
$T\gtrsim T_c$.

established, its practical implementation remains a tedious process. The
development of a fully automated algorithm to perform such calculations serves
two purposes. First, it will make this powerful tool available to large number
of researchers. Second, it frees the calculation process from arbitrary

fundamental scale in nature is as low as TeV. The problem becomes even more
challenging if we assume that there are only {\it two} extra compact spatial
dimensions, because thermal history of such a Universe is strongly constrained
by various cosmological and astrophysical bounds which translate the maximal
temperature of the Universe which must not exceed $\sim {\cal O}(10)$MeV. This
simply reiterates that the observed baryon asymmetry must be synthesised just
above the nucleosynthesis scale. In this talk we address how to construct a
simple model which can overcome this challenge.

charges of the particles, fundamental fermions, intermediate bosons and

reported. According to the chirality of the weak charge the origin of parity
nonconservation in the weak interactions is reasonably explained. According to
the symmetry of the weak charge, an extension of the standard model is
proposed. In this scenario, all the three generations of neutrinos are massive
Dirac particles; both the right-handed neutrinos and the right-handed neutral
baryons have zero weak charge, and so they do not take part in the weak

intriguing open questions in theoretical physics. A subplot in this drama is
the renowned Cardy-Verlinde formula, which uses two-dimensional conformal
formalism to explain the entropy of an arbitrary-dimensional black hole. In
this paper, by exploiting the AdS/CFT and black hole-string dualities, we are
able to provide a physical picture for this paradoxical behavior. Following a
recent study by Haylo (in a dS context), we show that the dual CFT for an
asymptotically AdS spacetime actually conforms to a string-like description.
Moreover, we demonstrate that this stringy CFT is directly related to a string
that lives on the stretched horizon of an AdS-Schwarzschild-like black hole. In
fact, after an appropriate renormalization, these two boundary theories are
shown to be thermodynamically equivalent.

connection of the gravitation field direction with a preferred direction in
space (instead of the direction towards the Earth centre), that had lead to the
antipode paradox, (2) statement that the Earth (not the Sun) is the centre of
the planetary system, that had lead to the Ptolemaic doctrine. Now these ADs
have been overcame. In the paper one considers four modern and not yet got over
ADs, whose corollaries are false space-time geometry in the micro world and
most of problems and difficulties of the quantum field theory (QFT). One shows
that ADs have a series of interesting properties: (1) ADs appear to be
long-living delusions, because they are compensated partly by means of
introduction of compensating (Ptolemaic) conceptions, (2) ADs influence on
scientific investigations, generating a special pragmatic style (P-style) of
investigations resembling experimental trial and error method, (3) acting on
investigations directly and via P-style, ADs direct the science development
into a blind alley. One considers concrete properties of modern ADs and the
methods of their overcoming. From viewpoint of application the paper is an
analysis of mistakes, made in the quantum theory development. One analyses

Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type of maximal entanglement between many
atomic ensembles based on laser manipulation and single-photon detection. The
scheme, with inherent fault tolerance to the dominant noise and efficient
scaling of the efficiency with the number of ensembles, allows to maximally
entangle many atomic ensemble within the reach of current technology. Such a
maximum entanglement of many ensembles has wide applications in demonstration
of quantum nonlocality, high-precision spectroscopy, and quantum information
processing.

more natural from one perspective than another. More importantly, each approach
suggests ways of generalizing its counterparts. In this paper, we focus on the
construction of quantum models for algebraic systems with intrinsic degrees of
freedom. Semi-classical partial quantizations, for which only the intrinsic
degrees of freedom are quantized, arise naturally out of this construction. The
quantization of the SU(3) and rigid rotor models are considered as examples.

teleporting an entangled photon with such high quality that the nonlocal
quantum correlations with its original partner photon are preserved. This
procedure is also known as entanglement swapping. The nonlocality is confirmed
by observing a violation of Bell's inequality by 4.5 standard deviations. Thus,
by demonstrating quantum nonlocality for photons that never interacted our
results directly confirm the quantum nature of teleportation.

  in the He-Ion","Submitted to Europhysics Letters",,"10.1209/epl/i2002-00222-0",,"quant-ph",,"  Entanglement may be considered a resource for quantum-information processing,
as the origin of robust and universal equilibrium behaviour, but also as a
limit to the validity of an effective potential approach, in which the
influence of certain interacting subsystems is treated as a potential. Here we
show that a closed three particle (two protons, one electron) model of a He-ion
featuring realistic size, interactions and energy scales of electron and
nucleus, respectively, exhibits different types of dynamics depending on the
initial state: For some cases the traditional approach, in which the nucleus
only appears as the center of a Coulomb potential, is valid, in others this
approach fails due to entanglement arising on a short time-scale. Eventually
the system can even show signatures of thermodynamical behaviour, i.e. the
electron may relax to a maximum local entropy state which is, to some extent,
independent of the details of the initial state.

possible pure-state trajectories are confined to certain regions in Hilbert

the initial state; for the canonical condition it coincides with that defined
by Jaynes' principle. It is these states which thermodynamical systems should
generically evolve into.
