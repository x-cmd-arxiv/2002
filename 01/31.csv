model spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of similar galaxies, we compare

finding that an estimator based on integrated (3-1000um) IR luminosity
reproduces the model SFRs best. Applying this estimator to model fits to the
SEDs of our 22 spiral and starburst galaxies, we find that they are forming
stars at rates of ~1-100 M_sol/yr, with a median value of ~40M_sol/yr, assuming
an Einstein - de Sitter universe with a Hubble constant of 50 km/s/Mpc, and
star formation taking place according to a Salpeter (1955) IMF across the mass
range 0.1-100M_sol. We split the redshift range 0.0<z<0.6 into two equal-volume
bins to compute raw estimates of the star formation rate density contributed by
these sources, assuming the same cosmology and IMF as above and computing
errors based on estimated uncertainties in the SFRs of individual galaxies. We
compare these results with other estimates of the SFR density made with the
same assumptions, showing them to be consistent with the results of Flores et
al. (1999) from their ISO survey of the CFRS 1415+52 field. However, the

high optical depth for hydrogen Lyman transitions. Here I suggest certain metal
lines as tracers of the hydrogen neutral fraction. These lines should cause
unsaturated absorption when the IGM is almost fully neutral, if it is polluted
to metallicities Z ~ 10^-3.5--10^-2.5 Z_solar. Such a minimal level of metal
pollution is inevitable in the middle to late stages of reionization unless
quasars rather than stars are the dominant source of ionizing photons. The OI
line at 1302 Angstroms is particularly promising: the OI and H ionization
potentials are almost identical, and OI should be in very tight charge exchange
equilibrium with H. The SiII 1260 Angstrom transition might also be observable.
At high redshift, overdense regions are the first to be polluted to high
metallicity but the last to remain permanently ionized, due to the short
recombination times. Such regions should produce a fluctuating OI and SiII
forest which, if observed, would indicate large quantities of neutral hydrogen.
The OI forest may already be detectable in the SDSS z=6.28 quasar. If seen in
future high-redshift quasars, the OI and SiII forests will probe the topology
of reionization and metal pollution in the early universe. If in additional the
HI optical depth can be measured from the damping wing of a high-redshift
gamma-ray burst, they will yield a very robust measure of the metallicity of

is much lower than in the earlier M types, in spite of comparatively rapid
rotation. We investigate the possibility that this drop-off in activity results
from the very high electrical resistivities in the dense, cool and
predominantly neutral atmospheres of late-M and L dwarfs. We calculate magnetic
field diffusivities in the atmospheres of objects with effective temperatures
in the range 3000-1500 (mid-M to L), using the atmospheric structure models of
Allard and Hauschildt. We find that the combination of very low ionization
fraction and high density in these atmospheres results in very large
resistivities due to neutral-charged particle collisions, and efficient field
diffusion. The resistivities are found to increase with both decreasing optical
depth, and decreasing effective temperature. As a result, any existing magnetic
fields are increasingly decoupled from atmospheric motions as one moves from
mid-M to L; we quantify this through a simple Reynolds number calculation.
This, coupled with the difficulty in transporting magnetic stresses through the
highly resistive atmosphere, can account for the observed drop in activity from
mid-M to L, assuming activity in these objects is magnetically driven. We also
examine the issue of acoustic heating, and find that this appears inadequate to
explain the observed H-alpha fluxes in mid-M to L dwarfs. Consequently,
magnetic heating does seem to be the most viable mechanism for generating
activity in these objects. Finally, we speculate on a possible flare mechanism

10 percent of halo mass in the mass of negative angular momentum $j$. After the
mass of negative $j$ is excluded, the cumulative mass function $M(<j)$ follows
approximately the universal function proposed by Bullock et al., though we
still find a significant fraction of halos ($\sim 50%$) which exhibit

in the context of the turbulent atomic interstellar medium (ISM). First, we
pre- sent a brief summary of the linear theory, remarking that, in the atomic
ISM, the wave mode is stable at small scales. Next, we revisit the growth of
isolated entropy perturbations in initially unstable gas, as a function of the
ratio $\eta$ of the cooling to the dynamical crossing times. Third, we consider
the evolution of {\it velocity} perturbations. These correspond to the wave
mode, and are stable at moderate amplitudes and small scales, as confirmed
numerically. Fourth, we consider the behavior of magnetic pressure in turbulent
regimes. We propose that recent findings of a poor B-rho correlation at low rho
are due to the different B-rho scalings for the slow and fast modes of non-
linear MHD waves. This implies that, in fully turbulent regimes, the magnetic
field may not be a very efficient source of pressure, and that polytropic de-
scriptions of magnetic pressure are probably not adequate. Finally, we discuss
simulations of the ISM (and resolution issues) concerned with the possibility
of significant amounts of gas being in the ``lukewarm'' temperature range be-
tween the warm and cold stable phases. The mass fraction in this range in-
creases, and the phase segregation decreases, as smaller scales are considered.
We attribute this to the enhanced stability of moderate, adiabatic-like veloc-
ity fluctuations with $\eta \gg 1$, to the recycling of gas from the dense to
the diffuse phase by stellar energy injection, and to the magnetic field not
being strongly turbulent there, possibly providing additional stability. Final-
ly, we suggest that the lukewarm gas can be observationally distinguished
through simultaneous determination of two of its thermodynamic variables.

star--disk configuration and investigate the expansion of the poloidal field
lines and partial field-line opening caused by the differential rotation
between the star and a nonuniformly-rotating disk. I present a simple
analytical model that describes the asymptotic behavior of the field in the
strong-expansion limit. I demonstrate the existence of a finite (of order one
radian) critical twist angle, beyond which the poloidal field starts inflating
very rapidly. If the relative star--disk twist is enhanced locally, in some
finite part of the disk (which may be the case for a Keplerian disk that
extends inward significantly closer to the central star than the corotation
radius), then, as the twist is increased by a finite amount, the field
approaches a partially-open configuration, with some field lines going out to
infinity. Simultaneous with this partial field opening, a very thin, radially
extended current layer forms, thus laying out a way towards reconnection in the
disk magnetosphere. Reconnection, in turn, leads to a very interesting scenario
for a quasi-periodic behavior of magnetically-linked star--disk systems with
successive cycles of field inflation, opening, and reconnection.

poloidal field threading the hole is not significantly larger than that
threading the inner edge of the disc. The results imply that the radio-loudness

the shortest timescales, spatially and temporally correlated coronal flares can
explain X-ray temporal and spectral variability observed in Seyfert galaxies.
In particular, power density spectra, flux-spectral index and flux-variance

variations (i.e. state transitions in GBHC) are associated with parameters
varying on longer timescales, such as accretion rate, coronal strength or

accretion disc theory, here we discuss why energetically dominant coronae at
low accretion rates are ideal sites for launching powerful MHD driven outflows.
Then, if the outflow is radiatively inefficient, then so is the source overall,
even without advection being relevant for the dynamics of the accretion flow.
This could be an alternative scenario for LLAGN and GBHC in their low/hard

The calculations are carried out using the Breit-Pauli R-matrix (BPRM) method
with a 31-level eigenfunction expansion. Resonance structures in collision
strengths are delineated in detail up to the n = 4 thresholds. For highly
charged He-like ions radiation damping of autoionizing resonances is known to

to a factor of 4 higher at T < 10^6 K than previous values. This is likely to
be of considerable importance in the diagnostics of photoionized astrophysical

for a half-filled one-dimensional electron system with on-site repulsive

variationally and self-consistently with a fixed electron-phonon coupling

The result is examined in terms of charge gap and spin gap and is compared with

to single-spin asymmetries in deep inelastic lepton-proton scattering at

existence of such single-spin asymmetries requires a phase difference between
two amplitudes coupling the proton target with J^z_p = + 1/2 and -1/2 to the

proton anomalous magnetic moment. We show that the exchange of gauge particles
between the outgoing quark and the proton spectators produces a Coulomb-like
complex phase which depends on the angular momentum L_z of the proton's
constituents and is thus distinct for different proton spin amplitudes. The
single-spin asymmetry which arises from such final-state interactions does not
factorize into a product of distribution function and fragmentation function,

correlates transversely polarized quarks with the spin of the transversely

can self-accelerate in flat spacetime (the ``self-accelerating box paradox'').
  From the point of view of the box, which perceives the acceleration as an
impressed gravitational field, this is equivalent to asking whether the box can
be supported by the buoyant force arising from its immersion in a perceived
bath of thermal (Unruh) radiation. The perfect mirrors we study are of the type
that rely on light internal degrees of freedom which adjust to and reflect
impinging radiation. We suggest that a minimum of one internal mirror degree of
freedom is required for each bulk field degree of freedom reflected. A short
calculation then shows that such mirrors necessarily absorb enough heat from
the thermal bath that their increased mass prevents them from floating on the
thermal radiation. For this type of mirror the paradox is therefore resolved.
We also observe that this failure of boxes to ``float'' invalidates one of the
assumptions going into the Unruh-Wald analysis of entropy balances involving
boxes lowered adiabatically toward black holes. Nevertheless, their broad
argument can be maintained until the box reaches a new regime in which
box-antibox pairs dominate over massless fields as contributions to thermal
radiation.

rational function of the first few determinants. A. Borodin found these
relations using Riemann-Hilbert methods.
  The nature of Borodin's relations pointed towards the Toeplitz lattice and
its Virasoro algebra, as developed by the authors. In this paper, we take the
Toeplitz and Virasoro approach for a fairly large class of symbols, leading to
a systematic and simple way of generating such recursion relations.
  The latter are very naturally expressed in terms of the $L$-matrices
appearing in the Lax pair for the Toeplitz lattice equations. As a surprise, we
find, compared to Borodin's, a different set of relations, except for the
3-step relations associated with the symbol $ e^{t(z+z^{-1})}$. Moreover, these
recursion relations define an invariant manifold for the Toeplitz lattice. This
leads to a ""discrete Painlev\'e property"" (singularity confinement) for the
rational recursion relations, as a consequence of the classical ``continuous
Painlev\'e property"" for the Toeplitz lattice.

spatial clustering is of vivid interest for many applications; are, e.g.,
galaxies with high luminosities more strongly clustered than dim ones? Do
neighbored pores in a sandstone have similar sizes? How does the shape of
impact craters on a planet depend on the geological surface properties? In this
article, we give an introduction into the appropriate mathematical framework to
deal with such questions, i.e. the theory of marked point processes. After
having clarified the notion of segregation effects, we define universal test
quantities applicable to realizations of a marked point processes. We show
their power using concrete data sets in analyzing the luminosity-dependence of
the galaxy clustering, the alignment of dark matter halos in gravitational
$N$-body simulations, the morphology- and diameter-dependence of the Martian
crater distribution and the size correlations of pores in sandstone. In order
to understand our data in more detail, we discuss the Boolean depletion model,
the random field model and the Cox random field model. The first model
describes depletion effects in the distribution of Martian craters and pores in
sandstone, whereas the last one accounts at least qualitatively for the
observed luminosity-dependence of the galaxy clustering.

using a polylogarithmic ($O(\log^k n), k\geq 1$) number of qubits and a
polylogarithmic number of computation steps. The current research in the
literature has focussed on using a polynomial number of qubits. A new
mathematical model of computation called \emph{Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)}
is defined, building on Deutsch's model of quantum computational network. The
model introduces a nonlinear and irreversible gate, similar to the speculative
operator defined by Abrams and Lloyd. The precise dynamics of this operator are
defined and while giving examples in which nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger's
equations are applied, we speculate on its possible implementation. The many
practical problems associated with the current model of quantum computing are
alleviated in the new model. It is shown that QNNs of logarithmic size and
constant depth have the same computational power as threshold circuits, which
are used for modeling neural networks. QNNs of polylogarithmic size and
polylogarithmic depth can solve the problems in \NC, the class of problems with
theoretically fast parallel solutions. Thus, the new model may indeed provide
an approach for building scalable parallel computers.

continuously monitored open quantum system. The first is Markovian feedback as
introduced in quantum optics by Wiseman and Milburn [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 70},
548 (1993)]. The second is feedback based on an estimate of the system state,
developed recently by Doherty {\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 62}, 012105
(2000)]. Here we choose to call it, for brevity, {\em Bayesian feedback}. For
systems with nonlinear dynamics, we expect these two methods of feedback
control to give markedly different results. The simplest possible nonlinear
system is a driven and damped two-level atom, so we choose this as our model
system. The monitoring is taken to be homodyne detection of the atomic
fluorescence, and the control is by modulating the driving. The aim of the
feedback in both cases is to stabilize the internal state of the atom as close
as possible to an arbitrarily chosen pure state, in the presence of inefficient
detection and other forms of decoherence. Our results (obtain without recourse
to stochastic simulations) prove that Bayesian feedback is never inferior, and
is usually superior, to Markovian feedback. However it would be far more
difficult to implement than Markovian feedback and it loses its superiority
when obvious simplifying approximations are made. It is thus not clear which
form of feedback would be better in the face of inevitable experimental
imperfections.
