the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in the radio continuum at 3 and

few arcseconds. The integrated 6cm fluxes are up to 1.3 times higher than the
3cm fluxes with spectral indices averaged over the whole clump between
$\alpha=-0.1$ and -0.5 ($S_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha}$), indicating the likely
presence of non-thermal emission in at least some of the sources. All measured
fluxes are at least one order of magnitude higher than those predicted by
Brandner et al. 2000. Due to the unexpectedly large radio luminosities of the
ProPlyD-like features and because the radio emission is extended a
(proto-)stellar origin of the non-thermal emission from a dust enshrouded star
appears unlikely. Instead we propose that magnetized regions within the

odds, however, with detailed investigations of reionization, which favor a more

of more realistic reionization histories and applied it to data obtained from
numerical simulations of reionization. We show that the prompt reionization
assumed by CMBFAST in its original form heavily contaminates any constraint
derived on the reionization redshift. We find, however, that prompt
reionization models give a reasonable estimate of the epoch at which the mean
cosmic ionization fraction was ~50%, and provide a very good measure of the
overall Thomson optical depth. The overall differences in the temperature

momentum vectors of the gas and dark matter are poorly aligned, with a median
misalignment angle of about 30 degrees, which might have important implications
for spin correlation statistics used in weak lensing studies. We present
distributions for the component of the angular momentum that is aligned with
the total angular momentum of each halo, and find that for between 5 and 50
percent of the mass this component is negative. This disagrees with the
`Universal' angular momentum distribution suggested by Bullock et al. (2001),
for which the mass fraction with negative specific angular momentum is zero. We
discuss the implications of our results for the formation of disk galaxies.
Since galactic disks generally do not contain counter-rotating stars or gas,
disk formation cannot occur under detailed conservation of specific angular
momentum. We suggest that the material with negative specific angular momentum
combines with positive angular momentum material to build a bulge component,
and show that in such a scenario the remaining material can form a disk with a
density distribution that is very close to exponential.

decay is obtained by expanding the observed flux in terms of (\beta), where
(\beta) is the maximum velocity of the ejecta divided by the speed of light
(c). It is shown that the Doppler effect brightens the light curve owing to the
delayed decay of radioactive nuclei as well as to the Lorentz boosting of the
photon energies. The leading correction term is quadratic in (\beta), thus
being proportional to (E_{\rm k}/(M_{\rm ej} c^2)), where (E_{\rm k}) and
(M_{\rm ej}) are the kinetic energy of explosion and the ejecta mass. It is
also shown that the correction term evolves as a quadratic function of time
since the explosion. The relativistic effect is negligibly small at early
phases, but becomes of considerable size at late phases. In particular, for
supernove having a very large energy(hypernova) or exploding in a jet-like or
whatever non-spherical geometry, (^{56})Ni is likely to be boosted to higher
velocities and then we might see an appreciable change in flux. However, the

spectrum of Eta Carinae, one of the most massive and powerful stars in the
Galaxy and which is strongly suspected to be a colliding wind binary system.
Hydrodynamic models of colliding winds are used to generate synthetic X-ray
spectra for a range of mass-loss rates and wind velocities. They are then
fitted against newly acquired Chandra grating data. We find that due to the low
velocity of the primary wind (~500 km/s), most of the observed X-ray emission
appears to arise from the shocked wind of the companion star. We use the
duration of the lightcurve minimum to fix the wind momentum ratio at 0.2. We
are then able to obtain a good fit to the data by varying the mass-loss rate of
the companion and the terminal velocity of its wind. We find that Mdot ~ 1e-5
Msol/yr and v ~ 3000 km/s. With observationally determined values of ~500-700
km/s for the velocity of the primary wind, our fit implies a primary mass-loss
rate of Mdot ~ 2.5e-4 Msol/yr. This value is smaller than commonly inferred,
although we note that a lower mass-loss rate can reduce some of the problems
noted by Hillier et al. (2001) when a value as high as 1e-3 Msol/yr is used.
The wind parameters of the companion are indicative of a massive star which may
or may not be evolved. The line strengths appear to show slightly sub-solar
abundances, although this needs further confirmation. Based on the
over-estimation of the X-ray line strengths in our model, and re-interpretation
of the HST/FOS results, it appears that the homunculus nebula was produced by

and nearby metal-poor star-forming galaxies may provide templates for
primordial star formation. In particular, the dust content of such objects is
of great importance since early molecular formation can take place on grains.
To gain insight into primeval galaxies at high redshift, we examine the dust
content of the nearby extremely low-metallicity galaxy SBS 0335-052 which hosts
a very young starburst (< 10 Myr). In young galaxies, the dust formation rate
in Type II supernovae governs the amount of dust, and by incorporating recent
results on dust production in Type II supernovae we model the evolution of dust
content. If the star-forming region is compact (< 100 pc), as suggested by
observations of SBS 0335-052, our models consistently explain the quantity of
dust, far-infrared luminosity, and dust temperature in this low-metallicity
object. We also discuss the H_2 abundance. The compactness of the region is
important to H_2 formation, because the optical depth of dust for UV photons
becomes large and H_2 dissociation is suppressed. We finally focus on
implications for damped Ly alpha systems.

heavy nucleus accurately and model independently. This is because the weak
charge of the neutron is much larger then that of the proton. The Parity Radius
Experiment (PREX) at Jefferson Laboratory aims to measure the root mean square
neutron radius of $^{208}$Pb with an absolute accuracy of 1% ($\pm 0.05$ Fm).
This is more accurate then past measurements with hadronic probes, which all
suffer from controversial strong interaction uncertainties. PREX should clearly
resolve the neutron-rich skin. Furthermore, this benchmark value for $^{208}$Pb
will provide a calibration for hadronic probes, such as proton scattering,
which can then be used to measure neutron densities of many exotic nuclei. The
PREX result will also have many implications for neutron stars. The neutron
radius of Pb depends on the pressure of neutron-rich matter: the greater the
pressure, the larger the radius as neutrons are pushed out against surface
tension. The same pressure supports a neutron star against gravity. The Pb
radius is sensitive to the equation of state at normal densities while the
radius of a 1.4 solar mass neutron star also depends on the equation of state
at higher densities. Measurements of the radii of a number of isolated neutron
stars such as Geminga and RX J185635-3754 should soon improve significantly. By
comparing the equation of state information from the radii of both Pb and
neutron stars one can search for a softening of the high density equation of
state from a phase transition to an exotic state. Possibilities include kaon
condensates, strange quark matter or color superconductors.

parameter interpolates smoothly between the end planes carrying two different

reflection coefficient obtained with the aid of the perturbation theory (the
impedance is the small parameter) and (ii) the direct calculation of the energy
flux through the metallic surface, when to get the answer only the tangential
magnetic field at the surface of a perfect conductor of the same geometry has

spin quantum number S as S(S+1). The prove holds for homonuclear HSSs which
fulfill a weak homogenity condition. Moreover, the extremal values of the exact
spectrum of various HSS which were studied numerically were found to lie on
approximate parabolas, named rotational bands, which could be obtained by a
shift of the boundary parabolas. In view of this, it has been claimed that the
rotational band structure (RBS) of the energy spectrum is a general behavior of
HSSs. Furthermore, since the approximate parabolas are very close to the true
boundaries of the spectrum for the examples discussed, it has been claimed that
the methods allow to predict the detailed shape of the spectrum and related
properties for a general HSS. In this comment I will show by means of examples
that the RBS hypothesis is not valid for general HSSs. In particular, weak
homogenity is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a HSS to
exhibit a spectrum with RBS.

the framework of many-body Green's funtion theory which considers all

term, an external field, a second- and fourth-order uniaxial single-ion
anisotropy, and the magnetic dipole-dipole coupling. The single-ion anisotropy
terms can be treated exactly by introducing higher-order Green's functions and
subsequently taking advantage of relations between products of spin operators
which leads to an automatic closure of the hierarchy of the equations of motion
for the Green's functions with respect to the anisotropy terms. This is an
improvement on the method of our previous work, which treated the corresponding
terms only approximately by decoupling them at the level of the lowest-order
Green's functions. RPA-like approximations are used to decouple the exchange
terms in both the low-order and higher-order Green's functions. As a first
numerical example we apply the theory to a monolayer for spin S=1 in order to
demonstrate the superiority of the present treatment of the anisotropy terms
over the previous approximate decouplings.

to first order in noise strength, but including a partial resummation to all
orders which captures the singular dependence on the microscopic cutoff
associated to the spatial correlation of the noise. This dependence is
essential for a quantitative and qualitative understanding of fluctuating
fronts, affecting both scaling properties and nonuniversal quantities. Our
results predict phenomena such as the shift of the transition point between the
pushed and pulled regimes of front propagation, in terms of the noise
parameters, and the corresponding transition to a non-KPZ universality class.
We assess the quantitative validity of the results in several examples

allow us to completely break the SU(3) symmetry of the sea flavors. To create a

assuming that htis is is approximately $Q^2$ invariant, we can completely
determine the $x$-dependence of this asymmetry, which satisfies constituent
counting rules and reproduces the basic results of the Bremsstrahlung model
originated by Close and Sivers. This asymmetry can be combined with the
measured unpolarized gluon density, $G(x,Q^2)$ to provide a prediction for
$\Delta G(x,Q^2)$. Existing and proposed experiments can test both the
prediction of scale-invariance for $A_G(x,Q^2)$ and the nature of $\Delta G$

fireball. Assuming entropy conservation, its bulk thermodynamic properties can
then be uniquely obtained once the equation of state (EoS) is specified. The

evolution is specified without reference to dilepton data, thus eliminating it

large volume compactifications. The intersections of the D8-branes are chosen

that an inflaton on either brane will experience no order rho^2 corrections in
the Hubble rate H due to its own energy density, although an observer on the
opposite brane does see such a correction. Thus there is no enhancement of the
slow-roll condition unless inflation is simultaneously driven by inflatons on
both branes. Similarly, during radiation domination, the rho^2 correction to H
on a given brane vanish unless there is nonvanishing energy density on the
opposite brane. During the electroweak phase transition the correction can be
large, but is has the wrong sign for causing sphalerons to go out of thermal

Therefore, we predict that branes are more likely to be created than black
holes in super-Planckian scattering processes in these manifolds. The higher

significantly enhances possible detection of non-perturbative gravitational
events in future hadron colliders and cosmic rays detectors.

For two interfacial orientations, [100] and [111], the structure and dynamics

properties, it is observed that as the interface is traversed from fluid to

moving in an arbitrary magnetic field has a nonadiabatic geometric phase
proportional to the solid angle subtended by the trace of the spin. For neutral
particles with higher spin, this is true for cyclic solutions with special
initial conditions. For more general cyclic solutions, however, this does not
hold. As an example, we consider the most general solutions of such particles
moving in a rotating magnetic field. If the parameters of the system are
appropriately chosen, all solutions are cyclic. The nonadiabatic geometric
phase and the solid angle are both calculated explicitly. It turns out that the
nonadiabatic geometric phase contains an extra term in addition to the one
proportional to the solid angle. The extra term vanishes automatically for spin
1/2. For higher spin, however, it depends on the initial condition. We also
consider the valence electron of an alkaline atom. For cyclic solutions with
special initial conditions in an arbitrary strong magnetic field, we prove that
the nonadiabatic geometric phase is a linear combination of the two solid
angles subtended by the traces of the orbit and spin angular momenta. For more
general cyclic solutions in a strong rotating magnetic field, the nonadiabatic
geometric phase also contains extra terms in addition to the linear
combination.
