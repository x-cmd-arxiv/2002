that gas blueshifted by more than 70 km/s relative to the systemic velocity of

simple model of a mass-conserving free wind to infer mass outflow rates in the
range (dM/dt)_tot(H) = 13-133 M_sun/yr for galaxies hosting a wind. These
values of (dM/dt)_tot, normalized to the corresponding global star formation
rates inferred from infrared luminosities, are in the range eta = (dM/dt)_tot /

measurements of nearby dwarfs, edge-on spirals, and lower-luminosity infrared

radiation spectra of neutron stars with surface magnetic fields B=10^14-10^15
G, as appropriate for magnetars. Vacuum polarization modifies the dielectric
property of the medium and gives rise to a resonance feature in the opacity;
this feature is narrow and occurs at a photon energy that depends on the plasma
density. Vacuum polarization can also induce resonant conversion of photon
modes via a mechanism analogous to the MSW mechanism for neutrino oscillation.
We construct atmosphere models in radiative equilibrium with an effective
temperature of a few \times 10^6 K by solving the full radiative transfer
equations for both polarization modes in a fully ionized hydrogen plasma. We
discuss the subtleties in treating the vacuum polarization effects in the
atmosphere models and present approximate solutions to the radiative transfer
problem which bracket the true answer. We show from both analytic
considerations and numerical calculations that vacuum polarization produces a
broad depression in the X-ray flux at high energies (a few keV \la E \la a few
tens of keV) as compared to models without vacuum polarization; this arises
from the density dependence of the vacuum resonance feature and the large
density gradient present in the atmosphere. Thus the vacuum polarization effect
softens the high energy tail of the thermal spectrum, although the atmospheric
emission is still harder than the blackbody spectrum because of the non-grey
opacities. We also show that the depression of continuum flux strongly
suppresses the equivalent width of the ion cyclotron line and therefore makes
the line more difficult to observe.

observation selection bias inherent in the calibration of absolute magnitudes
using trigonometric parallaxes. As a tutorial to gain an intuitive
understanding of several complicated trigonometric bias problems, we study a
toy bias model of a parallax catalog which incorporates assumed parallax
measuring errors of various severities. The two effects of bias errors on the
derived absolute magnitudes are (1) the Lutz-Kelker correction itself that
depends on the fractional parallax error and the spatial distribution, and (2)
a Malmquist-like `incompleteness' correction of opposite sign due to various
apparent magnitude cut-offs as they are progressively imposed on the catalog.
The simulations involve 3 million stars spread with varying density
distributions in a volume bounded by a radius of 50,000 pc. A fixed absolute
magnitude of M_V = +0.6 is used to imitate RR Lyrae variables in the mean. The
bias is demonstrated for various assumed spatial densities and parallax error
models, including one that is projected for the FAME satellite. The effects of
imposing magnit ude limits and limits on the `observer's' error are displayed.
We contrast the method of calculating mean absolute magnitude directly from the
parallaxes where bias corrections are mandatory, with an inverse method using
maximum likelihood which is free of the Lutz-Kelker bias, although a Malmquist
bias is present. We discuss the level of accuracy that can be expected in a
calibration of RR Lyrae absolute magnitudes from the FAME data over the
metallicity range of [Fe/H] from 0 to -2, given the known frequency of the
local RR Lyraes closer than 1.5 kpc.

apparent velocity shift in the H$\alpha$ line, which could be indicative of an
accretion hot spot in orbit around the brown dwarf; further confirmation of

Hysteresis in the soft state/hard state transition is observed. The hard state
exhibits a possible anti-correlation between coronal compactness (i.e.,
spectral hardness) and the covering fraction of cold, reflecting material. The
correlation between `reflection fraction' and soft X-ray flux, however, appears
to be more universal. Furthermore, low flux, hard state observations - taken
over a decline into quiescence- show that the Fe line, independent of
`reflection fraction', remains broad and at a roughly constant equivalent
width, counter to expectations from ADAF models. All power spectral densities
(PSD) of the hard state X-ray lightcurves are describable as the sum of just a
few broad, quasi-periodic features with frequencies that roughly scale as
coronal compactness to the -3/2 power. Similar to observations of Cyg X-1, time
lags between soft and hard variability anti-correlate with coronal compactness.
A stronger correlation is seen between the time lags and the `reflection
fraction'.

uncertainties of the solar central temperatures without assuming the luminosity

this is not the case for a model in which astrophysical effects are included
besides the neutrino oscillations. Therefore a combined, DSM+MSW model is
suggested to calculate the observed solar neutrino fluxes. The combined SSM+MSW
fits to the rates+spectra+D/N changes give a bad fit to the total rates,
indicating the need to include the astrophysical factors besides the MSW
effect. The DSM suggest that the core dynamics is induced by intermittent
events of dissipation of rotational energy in the solar core, in relation to
angular momentum dissipation arising from the relative motion of the Sun and
the mass center of the Solar System, and it shifts the allowed ranges of the
MSW parameters into a more acceptable region. The role of the astrophysical
factors in the solar neutrino problem is behind the fact why the ``smoking

independently of the magnetic-field inclination on the stellar surface (also,
in particular, for vertical fields). Consequently, the characteristic
antisymmetric linear-polarization signature of the scattered light in the D$_1$

10 G, regardless of their inclination. Remarkably, we find that the scattering
polarization amplitude of the D$_2$ line increases steadily with the magnetic

to the polarization of the D$_1$ line rapidly decreases. Therefore, we suggest
that spectropolarimetric observations of the ``quiet'' solar chromosphere

beliefs of multiple agents and their fusion. In the first part of the paper, we
develop logics for reasoning about cautiously merged beliefs of agents with
different degrees of reliability. The logics are obtained by combining the
multi-agent epistemic logic and multi-sources reasoning systems. Every ordering
for the reliability of the agents is represented by a modal operator, so we can
reason with the merged results under different situations. The fusion is
cautious in the sense that if an agent's belief is in conflict with those of
higher priorities, then his belief is completely discarded from the merged
result. We consider two strategies for the cautious merging of beliefs. In the
first one, if inconsistency occurs at some level, then all beliefs at the lower
levels are discarded simultaneously, so it is called level cutting strategy.
For the second one, only the level at which the inconsistency occurs is
skipped, so it is called level skipping strategy. The formal semantics and
axiomatic systems for these two strategies are presented. In the second part,
we extend the logics both syntactically and semantically to cover some more
sophisticated belief fusion and revision operators. While most existing
approaches treat belief fusion operators as meta-level constructs, these
operators are directly incorporated into our object logic language. Thus it is
possible to reason not only with the merged results but also about the fusion
process in our logics. The relationship of our extended logics with the
conditional logics of belief revision is also discussed.

numeric values to the players moves. The valuation reflects the desirability
moves. We assume a myopic player, who chooses a move with the highest
valuation. Valuations can also be revised, and hopefully improved, after each
play of the game. Here, a very simple valuation revision is considered, in
which the moves made in a play are assigned the payoff obtained in the play. We
show that by adopting such a learning process a player who has a winning
strategy in a win-lose game can almost surely guarantee a win in a repeated
game. When a player has more than two payoffs, a more elaborate learning
procedure is required. We consider one that associates with each move the
average payoff in the rounds in which this move was made. When all players
adopt this learning procedure, with some perturbations, then, with probability
1, strategies that are close to subgame perfect equilibrium are played after
some time. A single player who adopts this procedure can guarantee only her

as low as TeV, in order to address the naturalness of the electroweak scale. A
number of difficulties arise in constructing specific models; stabilisation of
the radius of the extra dimensions, avoidance of overproduction of Kaluza Klein
modes, achieving successful baryogenesis and production of a close to
scale-invariant spectrum of density perturbations with the correct amplitude.
We examine in detail the dynamics, including radion stabilisation, of a hybrid
inflation model that has been proposed in order to address these difficulties,
where the inflaton is a gauge singlet residing in the bulk. We find that for a
low fundamental scale the phase transition, which in standard four dimensional
hybrid models usually ends inflation, is slow and there is second phase of
inflation lasting for a large number of e-foldings. The density perturbations
on cosmologically interesting scales exit the Hubble radius during this second
phase of inflation, and we find that their amplitude is far smaller than is
required. We find that the duration of the second phase of inflation can be
short, so that cosmologically interesting scales exit the Hubble radius prior
to the phase transition, and the density perturbations have the correct
amplitude, only if the fundamental scale takes an intermediate value. Finally
we comment briefly on the implications of an intermediate fundamental scale for
the production of primordial black holes and baryogenesis.

  We first consider the general CP conserving dim-4 effective potential. To
fully reconstruct this potential, we show that even if all the Higgs masses and
their couplings to the standard model particles are measured one needs not only
to measure certain trilinear Higgs self-couplings but some of the quartic
couplings as well. We also advocate expressing the Higgs self couplings in the
mass basis. We show explicitly, that in the so-called decoupling limit, the
most easily accessible Higgs self-couplings are given in terms of the Higgs
mass while all other dependencies on the parameters of the general effective
potential are screened. This helps also easily explain how, in the
  MSSM, the largest radiative corrections which affect these self couplings are
reabsorbed by using the corrected Higgs mass. We also extend our analysis to
higher order operators in the effective Higgs potential. While the above
screening properties do not hold, we argue that these effects must be small and
may not be measured considering the foreseen poor experimental precision in the
extraction of the SUSY Higgs self-couplings.

Starting with a little spot of product, we compute the time needed to complete
the reaction in the container following an advection-reaction-diffusion

transports the reactants. If the size of the container is not very large
compared with the typical length of the velocity field one has a plateau of the
reaction time as a function of the strength of the velocity field, $U$. This
plateau appears both in the stationary and in the time-dependent flow. A
comparison of the results for the finite system with the infinite case (for
which the front speed, $v_f$, gives a simple estimate of the reacting time)

deviation of the initial phase space point, measured by the largest Lyapunov
exponent, for a dilute system of hard disks, both in equilibrium and in a
uniform shear flow. We derive a generalized Boltzmann equation for an extended
one-particle distribution that includes deviations from the reference phase
space point. The equation is valid for very low densities n, and requires an
unusual expansion in powers of 1/|ln n|. It reproduces and extends results from
the earlier, more heuristic clock model and may be interpreted as describing a
front propagating into an unstable state. The asymptotic speed of propagation
of the front is proportional to the largest Lyapunov exponent of the system.
Its value may be found by applying the standard front speed selection mechanism
for pulled fronts to the case at hand. For the equilibrium case, an explicit
expression for the largest Lyapunov exponent is given and for sheared systems
we give explicit expressions that may be evaluated numerically to obtain the
shear rate dependence of the largest Lyapunov exponent.
