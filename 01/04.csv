supernovae is reexamined.
  Both high redshift supernova teams are found to underestimate the effects of
host galaxy extinction. The evidence for an absolute magnitude- decay time
relation is much weakened if supernovae not observed before maximum light are
excluded. Inclusion of such objects artificially supresses the scatter about
the mean relation.
  With a consistent treatment of host galaxy extinction and elimination of
supernovae not observed before maximum, the evidence for a positive lambda is
not very significant (3-4 $\sigma$). A factor which may contribute to apparent
faintness of high z supernovae is evolution of the host galaxy extinction with
z.
  The Hubble diagram using all high z distance estimates, including SZ clusters
and gravitational lens time-delay estimates, does not appear inconsistent with
an $\Omega_o$ = 1 model.
  Although a positive $\Lambda$ can provide an, albeit physically unmotivated,
resolution of the low curvature implied by CMB experiments and evidence that
$\Omega_o <$ 1 from large-scale structure, the direct evidence from Type Ia
supernovae seems at present to be inconclusive.

10 pc. These estimates are confirmed by the fully non-linear numerical
simulations, in which the multi-phase inhomogeneous interstellar matter and its
interaction with the supernovae are consistently followed. The globally stable,
torus-like structure is highly inhomogeneous and turbulent. To achieve the high
column densities (> 10^{24} cm^{-2}) as suggested by observations of some
Seyfert 2 galaxies with nuclear starbursts, the viewing angle should be larger
than about 70 degree from the pole-on for a 10^8 solar mass massive black hole.
Due to the inhomogeneous internal structure of the torus, the observed column
density is sensitive to the line-of-sight, and it fluctuates by a factor of
order 100. The covering fraction for N > 10^{23} cm^{-2} is about 0.4. The
average accretion rate toward R < 1 pc is 0.4 solar mass/yr, which is boosted

that soft X-ray weak quasars (SXWQs, 10 AGN with alpha_ox<= -2) show the
strongest UV absorption at a given luminosity, and their maximum outflow
velocity, v_max, is strongly correlated with M_V (r_S=-0.95). This suggests
that v_max is largely set by the luminosity, as expected for radiation-pressure
driven outflows. Luminous SXWQs have preferentially low [O III] luminosity,
which suggests they are physically distinct from unabsorbed AGN, while
non-SXWQs with UV absorption are consistent with being drawn from the
unabsorbed AGN population. We also find an indication that v_max/v_BLR
increases with L/L_Edd, as expected for radiation-pressure driven outflows.
This relation and the v_max vs. M_V relation may indicate that the
radiation-pressure force multiplier increases with luminosity, and that the
wind launching radius in non-SXWQs is ~10 times larger than in SXWQs.

a semi-analytical scheme for augmenting existing evolution tracks of pre-main

open outermost boundary, an arbitrary amount of material could, in principal,
be accreted onto this central star. However, for the three cases considered

properties of supercooled liquids and the connection between these properties
and thermodynamics. The analysis in numerical models of the inherent structure
(IS) trajectories -- the set of local minima visited by the liquid -- offers
the possibility of filtering out the vibrational component of the motion of the
system on the potential energy surface and thereby resolving the slow
structural component more efficiently. Here we report an analysis of an IS
trajectory for a widely-studied water model, focusing on the changes in
hydrogen bond connectivity that give rise to many IS separated by relatively
small energy barriers. We find that while the system \emph{travels} through
these IS, the structure of the bond network continuously modifies, exchanging
linear bonds for bifurcated bonds and usually reversing the exchange to return
to nearly the same initial configuration. For the 216 molecule system we
investigate, the time scale of these transitions is as small as the simulation
time scale ($\approx 1$ fs). Hence for water, the transitions between each of
these IS is relatively small and eventual relaxation of the system occurs only
by many of these transitions. We find that during IS changes, the molecules
with the greatest displacements move in small ``clusters'' of 1-10 molecules
with displacements of $\approx 0.02-0.2$ nm, not unlike simpler liquids.
However, for water these clusters appear to be somewhat more branched than the
linear ``string-like'' clusters formed in a supercooled Lennar d-Jones system

which the classical symmetries are ""broken"", i.e. at the quantum level some

emergence of deformed dispersion relations, characterize both the

also characterized by sharp differences, even concerning the nature of the new

seem to dominate in the Universe. An even higher density of such matter seems
to be gravitationally trapped in the Galaxy. Thus its direct detection is
central to particle physics and cosmology. Current supersymmetric models
provide a natural dark matter candidate which is the lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP). Such models combined with fairly well understood physics like
the quark substructure of the nucleon and the nuclear structure (form factor
and/or spin response function), permit the evaluation of the event rate for
LSP-nucleus elastic scattering. The thus obtained event rates are, however,
very low or even undetectable. So it is imperative to exploit the modulation
effect, i.e. the dependence of the event rate on the earth's annual motion.
Also it is useful to consider the directional rate, i.e its dependence on the
direction of the recoiling nucleus. In this paper we study such a modulation
effect both in non directional and directional experiments. We calculate both
the differential and the total rates using both isothermal, symmetric as well
as only axially asymmetric, and non isothermal, due to caustic rings, velocity
distributions. We find that in the symmetric case the modulation amplitude is
small. The same is true for the case of caustic rings. The inclusion of
asymmetry, with a realistic enhanced velocity dispersion in the galactocentric
direction, yields an enhanced modulation effect, especially in directional
experiments.

exceptional and non-exceptional ones.
  Roughly speaking, there are the infinite families of non-exceptional
varieties, extremal contractions or singularities and only the finite number of
the types of exceptional ones.
  This subdivision is well demonstrated by the example of Du Val singularities.
There are two infinite series of non-exceptional singularities: $A_n$ and $D_n$
and only three types of exceptional ones: $E_6$, $E_7$ and $E_8$.
  Also the importance of exceptionality phenomenon follows from the next
observation: A). If a variety, extremal contraction or singularity is
non-exceptional then the linear system $|-nK_X|$ must have a ""good"" member for
small $n$. For example we can take $n\in \{1,2\}$ for the two-dimensional
singularities and $n\in \{1,2,3,4,6\}$ for the three-dimensional singularities.
B). Exceptional ones are ""bounded"" and can be classified.
  Using the inductive method of algebraic variety classification it was
obtained the description of three-dimensional exceptional hypersurface
singularities in this paper.

analysis is carried on in the limit of short correlation times, as a
perturbation theory in the ratio, scale by scale, of the eddy decay and
turn-over time. Various quantities such as the Batchelor constant and the
dimensionless constants entering the expression for particle relative and
self-diffusion are given in terms of this ratio and of the Kolmogorov constant.
Particular attention is paid to particles with finite inertia. The
self-diffusion properties of a particle with Stokes time longer than the
Kolmogorov time are determined, verifying on an analytical example the
dimensional results of [nlin.CD/0103018]. Expressions for the fluid velocity
Lagrangian correlations and correlation times along a solid particle
trajectory, are provided in several parameter regimes, including the infinite
Stokes time limit corresponding to Eulerian correlations. The concentration
fluctuation spectrum and the non-ergodic properties of a suspension of heavy
particles in a turbulent flow, in the same regime, are analyzed. The
concentration spectrum is predicted to obey, above the scale of eddies with
lifetime equal to the Stokes time, a power law with universal -4/3 exponent,
and to be otherwise independent of the nature of the turbulent flow. A
preference of the solid particle to lie in less energetic regions of the flow
is observed.
