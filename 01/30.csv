Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20020232",,"astro-ph cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  Observed self-gravitating systems reveal often fragmented non-equilibrium
structures that feature characteristic long-range correlations. However, models
accounting for non-linear structure growth are not always consistent with
observations and a better understanding of self-gravitating $N$-body systems
appears necessary. Because unstable gravitating systems are sensitive to
non-gravitational perturbations we study the effect of different dissipative
factors as well as different small and large scale boundary conditions on
idealized $N$-body systems. We find, in the interval of negative specific heat,
equilibrium properties differing from theoretical predictions made for
gravo-thermal systems, substantiating the importance of microscopic physics and
the lack of consistent theoretical tools to describe self-gravitating gas.
Also, in the interval of negative specific heat, yet outside of equilibrium,
unforced systems fragment and establish transient long-range correlations. The
strength of these correlations depends on the degree of granularity, suggesting
to make the resolution of mass and force coherent. Finally, persistent
correlations appear in model systems subject to an energy flow.

which have detectable H2 absorption. The apparent correlation between the
abundance ratios [Fe/S] and [Si/S] in the components indicates that the
abundance pattern is indeed due to dust-depletion. In particular, we find
evidence for depletion similar to what is observed in cold gas of the Galactic
disk ([Fe/Zn]=-1.59, Fe/S=-1.74, Zn/S=-0.15, [Si/S]=-0.85) in one of the
weakest components in which molecular hydrogen is detected with logN(H2)=16.5.
This is the first time such a large depletion is seen in a DLA system. This
observation supports the possibility that current samples of DLA systems might
be biased against the presence of cold and dusty gas along the line of sight.
The overall metallicities of this peculiar DLA system in which OI and CII are
spread over 1050 km/s are [P/H]=-0.64, [Zn/H]=-0.74 and [S/H]=-0.82 relative to
solar. The sub-DLA system at z=1.96753 has [P/H]>0.06, [Zn/H]>-0.02 and

show that the presence of H2 is closely related to the physical conditions of
the gas: high particle density together with low temperature. The observed
excitation of high J H2 levels and the molecular fraction show large variations
from one component to the other suggesting that the UV radiation field is
highly inhomogeneous throughout the system. Gas pressure, estimated from CI
absorptions, is larger than what is observed in the ISM of our Galaxy. All this
is probably a consequence of intense star-formation activity in the vicinity of

subsonic. Simulations starting with net toroidal flux may yield an average
$\alpha \sim 0.04.$ While being characterized by one order of magnitude larger

reproduces the spatial (i.e. deprojected) luminosity density profiles (error <
0.1%) is presented for detailed modelling of the Sersic family of luminosity
profiles. We evaluate both the symmetric and the non--axisymmetric components
of the gravitational potential and force, and compute the torques as a function
of position. For a given triaxiality, stellar systems with smaller values of n
have a greater non-axisymmetric gravitational field component. We also explore
the strength of the non-axisymmetric forces produced by bulges with differing n
and triaxiality on systems having a range of bulge-to-disc ratios. The
increasing disc-to-bulge ratio with increasing galaxy type (decreasing n) is
found to heavily reduce the amplitude of the non-axisymmetric terms, and
therefore reduce the possibility that triaxial bulges in late-type systems may
be the mechanism or perturbation for nonsymmetric structures in the disc. Using
seeing-convolved r^{1/n}-bulge plus exponential-disc fits to the K-band data
from a sample of 80 nearby disc galaxies, we probe the relations between galaxy
type, Sersic index n and the bulge-to-disc luminosity ratio. These relations

bulge luminosity. In the K-band, the trend of decreasing bulge-to-disc
luminosity ratio along the spiral Hubble sequence is predominantly, although
not entirely, a consequence of the change in the total bulge luminosity; the

dwarf nova 1RXS J232953.9+062814. Photometry in superoutburst reveals a
superhump with a period of 66.06(6) minutes. The low state spectrum shows
Balmer and HeI emission on a blue continuum, and in addition shows a rich
absorption spectrum of type K4 +- 2. The absorption velocity is modulated
sinusoidally at P_orb = 64.176(5) min, with semi-amplitude K = 348(4) km/s. The
low-state light curve is double-humped at this period, and phased as expected
for ellipsoidal variations. The absorption strength does not vary appreciably
around the orbit. The orbital period is shorter than any other cataclysmic
variable save for a handful of helium-star systems and V485 Centauri (59
minutes). The secondary is much hotter than main sequence stars of similar
mass, but is well-matched by helium-enriched models, indicating that the
secondary evolved from a more massive progenitor. A preliminary calculation in
which a 1.2 solar-mass star begins mass transfer near the end of H burning
matches this system's characteristics remarkably well.

gravitational forces is not completely established. Both the infinite range and
singularity in the Newtonian force law preclude the use of standard techniques.
However, astronomical observations of globular clusters suggests that they may
exist in distinct thermodynamic phases. Here, using dynamical simulation, we
investigate a model gravitational system which exhibits a phase transition in
the mean field limit. The system consists of rotating, concentric, mass shells
of fixed angular momentum magnitude and shares identical equilibrium properties
with a three dimensional point mass system satisfying the same condition. The
mean field results show that a global entropy maximum exists for the model, and
a first order phase transition takes place between ""quasi-uniform"" and
''core-halo'' states, in both the microcanonical and canonical ensembles. Here
we investigate the evolution and, with time averaging, the equilibrium
properties of the isolated system. Simulations were carried out in the
transition region, at the critical point, and in each clearly defined
thermodynamic phase, and striking differences were found in each case. We find
full agreement with mean field theory when finite size scaling is accounted
for. In addition, we find that (1) equilibration obeys power law behavior, (2)
virialization, equilibration, and the decay of correlations in both position
and time, are very slow in the transition region, suggesting the system is also
spending time in the metastable phase, (3) there is strong evidence of
long-lived, collective, oscillations in the supercritical region.

Complex structures in the core might not arise from a pair of overlapping rings

Instead, it seems more likely that the arcs and compact knots comprise a warm
(350 K) disrupted torus at the intersection of the larger polar lobes. Some of
the arcs appear to break out of the inner core region, and may be associated
with equatorial features seen in optical images. The torus could have been
disrupted by a post-eruption stellar wind, or by ejecta from the Great Eruption
itself if the torus existed before that event. Kinematic data are required to
rule out either possibility.

and this data set also probes the size distribution of galactic disks. We
predict this function using semi-analytic models of hierarchical galaxy
formation in a LCDM cosmology. We show that the basic trends found in the data
follow naturally from the redshift evolution of dark matter halos. The data are
consistent with a constant efficiency of turning gas into stars in galaxies,
with a best-fit value of 2%, where dust obscuration is neglected; equivalently,
the data are consistent with a cosmic star formation rate which is constant to
within a factor of two at all redshifts above two. However, the practical
ability to use this kind of distribution to measure the total cosmic star
formation rate is limited by the predicted shape of an approximate power law
with a smoothly varying power, without a sharp break.

metal-deficient protogalactic cloud, the gravitational collapse of filamentary
gas clouds is explored with 1D numerical hydrodynamics coupled with
non-equilibrium chemistry of H$_2$ and HD. It is found that the cloud evolution
is governed mainly by the initial central density ($n_{\rm c,0}$) and H$_2$
abundance ($x_{\rm H_2,0}$). In particular, the evolution of low-density
filaments bifurcates at a threshold H$_2$ abundance of $x_{\rm H_2,cr}\simeq 3
\times 10^{-3}$, beyond which HD cooling overwhelms H$_2$ cooling. The
contraction of a low density filament with $x_{\rm H_2, 0}\gtrsim x_{\rm
H_2,cr}$ is strongly decelerated when $n_{\rm c}$ reaches a critical density of
HD, and the filament is expected to fragment at $\sim 10^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$. The
fragment mass is lowered to be $\approx 10M_\odot$. In contrast, the
contraction of a low density filament with $x_{\rm H_2, 0}\lesssim x_{\rm
H_2,cr}$ is regulated by H$_2$ cooling. In this case, the fragment mass is as
high as $\approx 10^2M_\odot$. For a high-density filament, the cloud evolution
is governed by H$_2$ cooling. The fragmentation is not expected to take place
until the cloud becomes opaque in H$_2$ lines at $n_{\rm c,0}\sim 10^{12-13}$
cm$^{-3}$, so that the fragment mass is reduced to 1-2 M$_\odot$. As a result,
the stellar IMF could be bimodal and deficient in sub-solar mass stars, where
the high mass peak is around $10M_\odot$ or $10^2M_\odot$, dependently on
$n_{\rm c,0}$ and $x_{\rm H_2,0}$.

itself to be shaped by pressure forces and dynamics in the ionised and neutral

existing analytic models in four ways. (1) We use the more realistic
Navarro-Frenk-White profile instead of singular isothermal spheres, (2) we
include the effect of cosmology on the compactness of the lenses, (3) we use
elliptical instead of axially symmetric lenses, and (4) we take the intrinsic

model lead to a pronounced increase of the arc probability, comparisons with
numerical models of the same virial mass demonstrate that the analytic models
still fall short by a substantial margin of reproducing the results obtained

distributions, we show that the remaining discrepancy can be attributed to
substructure inside clusters and tidal fields contributed by the cluster
surroundings, effects that cannot reasonably and reliably be mimicked in

gamma-ray spectra (GeV-blazars) can be explained by assuming that in the
MeV-blazars, the production of gamma-rays is dominated by Comptonization of
infrared radiation of hot dust, whereas in the GeV-blazars -- by Comptonization
of broad emission lines. Additional ingredient, required to reach satisfactory
unification, is an assumption that the radiating electrons are accelerated via
a two step process, in the lower energy range -- following instabilities driven
by shock-reflected ions, and in the higher energy range -- via resonant
scatterings off Alfven waves. Our model predicts that on average, the
MeV-blazars should vary on longer time scales than GeV-blazars.

the possibility that their ground state exhibits spin and charge density waves
(SDW and CDW), which are primarily one-dimensional (i.e. stripes) and which
either compete with or promote superconductivity. Coexistence of CDW or SDW and
superconductivity has previously been reported in the lower Tc

absence of data showing stripes in the higher Tc materials in zero field has
lent support to the idea that stripes are competing with high temperature
superconductivity. However, here we show, using scanning tunneling spectroscopy
(STS), the existence of static striped density of electronic states in nearly
optimally doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d in zero field. This modulation is aligned with
the Cu-O bonds, with a periodicity of four lattice constants, and exhibits
features characteristic of a two-dimensional system of line objects. We further
show that the density of states modulation manifests itself as a shift of
states from above to below the superconducting gap. The fact that a single
energy scale (i. e., the gap) appears for both superconductivity and stripes
suggests that these two effects have the same origin.

the different transformation properties of the conserved currents under spatial

statistical significance of the null hypothesis H0 of an absence of crossover
(c0=infinity). When H0 is rejected, we estimate the crossover c0 using two
different competing models for the second regime beyond c0 and the bootstrap
method. For the catalog obtained by aggregating 14 subduction zones of the

more uncertain, so that the null hypothesis of an identical crossover for all
subduction zones cannot be rejected. Such a large value of the crossover
magnitude makes it difficult to associate it directly with a seismogenic
thickness as proposed by many different authors in the past. Our measure of c0

  Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids (accepted for publication)",,"10.1016/S0022-3093(02)01443-6",,"cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.soft",,"  We review in this work specific-heat experiments, that we have conducted on
different hydrogen-bonded glasses during last years. Specifically, we have
measured the low-temperature specific heat Cp for a set of glassy alcohols:
normal and fully-deuterated ethanol, 1- and 2- propanol, and glycerol. Ethanol
exhibits a very interesting polymorphism presenting three different solid
phases at low temperature: a fully-ordered (monoclinic) crystal, an
orientationally-disordered (cubic) crystal or 'orientational glass', and the
ordinary structural glass. By measuring and comparing the low-temperature
specific heat of the three phases, in the 'boson peak' range 2-10 K as well as
in the tunneling-states range below 1K, we are able to provide a quantitative
confirmation that ''glassy behavior'' is not an exclusive property of amorphous
solids. On the other hand, propanol is the simplest monoalcohol with two
different stereoisomers (1- and 2-propanol), what allows us to study directly
the influence of the spatial rearrangement of atoms on the universal properties
of glasses. We have measured the specific heat of both isomers, finding a
noteworthy quantitative difference between them. Finally, low-temperature
specific-heat data of glassy glycerol have also been obtained. Here we propose
a simple method based upon the soft-potential model to analyze low-temperature
specific-heat measurements, and we use this method for a quantitative
comparison of all these data of glassy alcohols and as a stringent test of
several universal correlations and scaling laws suggested in the literature. In
particular, we find that the interstitialcy model for the boson peak [A. V.
Granato, Phys. Rev. Lett. 68 (1992) 974] gives a very good account of the
temperature at which the maximum in Cp/T^3 occurs.

distributions of stock prices can be used to price options. Their model assumed
a directed random motion for the returns and consequently a lognormal
distribution of asset prices after a finite time. We point out two problems
with their formulation. First, we show that the option valuation is not
uniquely determined; in particular, stratergies based on the delta-hedge and
CAMP (Capital Asset Pricing Model) are shown to provide different valuations of
an option. Second, asset returns are known not to be Gaussian distributed.
Empirically, distributions of returns are seen to be much better approximated
by an exponential distribution. This exponential distribution of asset prices
can be used to develop a new pricing model for options that is shown to provide
valuations that agree very well with those used by traders. We show how the
Fokker-Planck formulation of fluctuations (i.e., the dynamics of the
distribution) can be modified to provide an exponential distribution for
returns. We also show how a singular volatility can be used to go smoothly from
exponential to Gaussian returns and thereby illustrate why exponential returns
cannot be reached perturbatively starting from Gaussian ones, and explain how
the theory of 'stochastic volatility' can be obtained from our model by making
a bad approximation. Finally, we show how to calculate put and call prices for
a stretched exponential density.

perturbations drag the axis of a gyroscope relative to the directions

axis by rotational perturbations beyond the $\dot{H}$ radius (H = Hubble

rotation inside a radius significantly larger than the $\dot{H}$ radius, then
the dragging of the gyroscope axis by the rotational perturbation is exact for
any equation of state for cosmological matter. 3) The time-evolution of a

be avoided if the model is interpreted as a sub-Planckian approximation
originating from a nonlocal theory with spontaneous Lorentz violation. The
present study thereby supports the validity of the standard-model extension as

duals, to cast the entropy of the CFT into the Cardy-Verlinde formula the
Casimir energy must contains the terms $ -n ({\mathcal{J}} \Omega_H+
\frac{Q\Phi}{2}+ \frac{Q\Phi_0}{2})$, which associate with rotational and
electric potential energies, and the extensive energy includes the term $-Q
\Phi_0$. For the Kerr-Newman-dS$_4$ black hole, we note that the Casimir energy
is negative but the extensive energy is positive on the cosmological horizon;
while the Casimir energy is positive but the extensive energy is negative on
the event horizon (the definitions for the two energies possess the same forms
as the corresponding quantities of the Kerr-Newman-AdS$_4$ black hole). Thus we
have to take the absolute value of the Casimir (extensive) energy in the
Cardy-Verlinde formula for the cosmological (event) horizon. The result for the
Kerr-Newman-dS$_4$ spacetime provides support of the dS/CFT correspondence.
Furthermore, we also obtain the Bekenstein-Verlinde-like entropy bound for the
Kerr-Newman-AdS$_4$ black hole and the D-bound on the entropy of matter system
in Kerr-Newman-dS$_4$ spacetime. We find that both the bounds are tightened by
the electric charge.

by `equivalence' and `undecidedness'. In this context, ten types of majority

choice rules that accept profiles of arbitrary reflexive relations. These rules
are discussed by means of many familiar, and some new conditions, including

  model and level sets",,,,"MSRI 2002-002","math.NA",,"  A two-step shape reconstruction method for diffuse optical tomography (DOT)
is presented which uses adjoint fields and level sets. The propagation of
near-infrared photons in tissue is modeled by the time-dependent linear
transport equation, of which the absorption parameter has to be reconstructed
from boundary measurements. In the shape reconstruction approach, it is assumed
that the inhomogeneous background absorption parameter and the values inside
the obstacles (which typically have a high contrast to the background) are
known, but that the number, sizes, shapes, and locations of these obstacles
have to be reconstructed from the data. An additional difficulty arises due to
the presence of so-called clear regions in the medium. The first step of the
reconstruction scheme is a transport-backtransport (TBT) method which provides
us with a low-contrast approximation to the sought objects. The second step
uses this result as an initial guess for solving the shape reconstruction
problem. A key point in this second step is the fusion of the 'level set
technique' for representing the shapes of the reconstructed obstacles, and an
'adjoint-field technique' for solving the nonlinear inverse problem. Numerical
experiments are presented which show that this novel method is able to recover
one or more objects very fast and with good accuracy.

nonmagnetic spherical bodies is calculated, at arbitrary temperatures. The
present paper is a continuation of an earlier investigation [Phys. Rev. E {\bf
63}, 051101 (2001)], in which F was evaluated in full only for the case of
ideal metals (refractive index n=infinity). Here, analogous results are
presented for dielectrics, for some chosen values of n. Our basic calculational
method stems from quantum statistical mechanics. The Debye expansions for the
Riccati-Bessel functions when carried out to a high order are found to be very
useful in practice (thereby overflow/underflow problems are easily avoided),
and also to give accurate results even for the lowest values of l down to l=1.
Another virtue of the Debye expansions is that the limiting case of metals
becomes quite amenable to an analytical treatment in spherical geometry. We
first discuss the zero-frequency TE mode problem from a mathematical viewpoint
and then, as a physical input, invoke the actual dispersion relations. The
result of our analysis, based upon the adoption of the Drude dispersion
relation at low frequencies, is that the zero-frequency TE mode does not
contribute for a real metal. Accordingly, F turns out in this case to be only
one half of the conventional value at high temperatures. The applicability of
the Drude model in this context has however been questioned recently, and we do
not aim at a complete discussion of this issue here. Existing experiments are
low-temperature experiments, and are so far not accurate enough to distinguish
between the different predictions. We also calculate explicitly the
contribution from the zero-frequency mode for a dielectric. For a dielectric,
this zero-frequency problem is absent.

show that the semi-dark states are equivalent to the singlet states of the
rotation group. They exist for many multiple qudit systems, whereas dark states
are quite rare. We then show that when a dark state is collapsed onto another
dark state of fewer parties, the resulting state is again dark. Furthermore,
one can use two orthogonal multi-qudit dark states to construct a
decoherence-free qudit.

least as powerful as $\NC^1$ circuits. More precisely, we define syntactic
models for quantum and stochastic branching programs of bounded width and prove
upper and lower bounds on their power. We show any $\NC^1$ language can be
accepted exactly by a width-2 quantum branching program of polynomial length,
in contrast to the classical case where width 5 is necessary unless
$\NC^1=\ACC$. This separates width-2 quantum programs from width-2 doubly
stochastic programs as we show the latter cannot compute the middle bit of
multiplication. Finally, we show that bounded-width quantum and stochastic
programs can be simulated by classical programs of larger but bounded width,
and thus are in $\NC^1$. The change in the revised version is the addition of
the syntactic condition.

Classically, for two players with one coin each, there is a symmetric stable
strategy that allows each player to win half of the times on average. A partial
quantization of the game (semiclassical) allows us to find a winning strategy
for the second player, but it is unstable w.r.t. the classical strategy.
However, in a fully quantum version of the game we find a winning strategy for
the first player that is optimal: the symmetric classical situation is broken
at the quantum level.

therefore can be used to do quantum logic operations. The experimental results
demonstrate that part of an inhomogeneously broadened absorption line can be
selected as a qubit and that a subset of ions in the material can control the
resonance frequency of other ions. This opens the way for the construction of
quantum gates in rare-earth-ion doped crystals.

forms of $D[\rho]$. In particular, we connect the familiar dissipation matrix
$L$ with a geometric version of $D[\rho]$, where $L$ consists of a positive sum
of projectors onto planes in $\mathbf{R}^3$. We also study the minimal number
of Lindblad terms needed to describe the most general case of $D[\rho]$. All
proofs are worked out comprehensively, as they present at the same time a
practical procedure how to determine explicitly the different forms of
$D[\rho]$. Finally, we perform a general discussion of the asymptotic behaviour
$t \to \infty$ of the density matrix and we relate the two types of asymptotic
behaviour with our geometric version of $D[\rho]$.

of multi-partite entanglement, with a number of parties that increases
unboundedly with input size, is necessary if the quantum algorithm is to offer
an exponential speed-up over classical computation. Furthermore we prove that
the algorithm can be classically efficiently simulated to within a prescribed
tolerance \eta even if a suitably small amount of global entanglement
(depending on \eta) is present. We explicitly identify the occurrence of
increasing multi-partite entanglement in Shor's algorithm. Our results do not
apply to quantum algorithms operating on mixed states in general and we discuss
the suggestion that an exponential computational speed-up might be possible
with mixed states in the total absence of entanglement. Finally, despite the
essential role of entanglement for pure state algorithms, we argue that it is
nevertheless misleading to view entanglement as a key resource for quantum
computational power.
