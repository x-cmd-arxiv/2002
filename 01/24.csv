optically unbiased sample of 2Jy radio galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0.15
< z < 0.7). These data -- which cover the nuclear regions of the target
galaxies -- allow us to quantify for the first time the various components that
contribute to the UV excess in the population of powerful, intermediate
redshift radio galaxies. We find that, contrary to the results of previous
surveys -- which have tended to be biased towards the most luminous and
spectacular objects in any redshift range -- the contribution of scattered
quasar light to the UV excess is relatively minor in most of the objects in our
sample. Only 7 objects (32% of the complete sample) show significant
polarization in the rest-frame UV, and none of the objects in our sample is
polarized in the near-UV at the P > 10% level. Careful measurement and
modelling of our spectra have allowed us to quantify the contributions of other
components to the UV excess. We show that nebular continuum (present in all
objects at the 3 -- 40% level), direct AGN light (significant in 40% of
objects), and young stellar populations (significant in 15 -- 50% of objects)
all make important contributions to the UV continuum in the population of
powerful radio galaxies. These results serve to emphasise the multi-component
nature of the UV continuum in radio galaxies. The results also point to an
interesting link betweeen the optical/UV and far-IR properties of our sample
objects, in the sense that the objects with the clearest evidence for
optical/UV starburst activity are also the most luminous at far-IR wavelengths.
This supports the idea that the cooler dust components in radio galaxies are
heated by starbursts rather than by AGN.

emission accounts for most of the ``quiescent'' (non-flaring) flux observed by
Chandra from Sgr A*; this emission is spatially extended on scales ~ R_A ~ 1''

should be present in deeper observations with a flux ~ 1/3 of the soft X-ray

of live, massive dark matter halos, we explore the impact of radial orbital

a previous semi--analytical finding: the requirement of stability matches
almost exactly the thinness of the FP. In other words, galaxy models that are
radially anisotropic enough to be found outside the observed FP (with their
isotropic parent models lying on the FP) are unstable, and their end--products
fall back on the FP itself. We also find that a systematic increase of radial
orbit anisotropy with galaxy luminosity cannot explain by itself the whole tilt
of the FP, becoming the galaxy models unstable at moderately high luminosities:
at variance with the previous case their end--products are found well outside

exhibit weaker X-ray reflection features (such as the iron K\alpha line) than
radio-quiet Seyferts. This has lead to speculation that the optically-thick
accretion disc in radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) may be truncated to
an optically-thin flow in the inner regions of the source. Here, we propose
that the weak reflection features are a result of reprocessing in an ionized
accretion disc. This would alleviate the need for a change in accretion
geometry in these sources. Calculations of reflection spectra from an ionized
disc for situations expected in radio-loud AGN (high accretion rate,
moderate-to-high black hole mass) predict weak reprocessing features. This idea
was tested by fitting the ASCA spectrum of the bright BLRG 3C 120 with the
constant density ionized disc models of Ross & Fabian. A good fit was found
with an ionization parameter of \xi ~4000 erg cm s^{-1} and the reflection
fraction fixed at unity. If observations of BLRGs by XMM-Newton show evidence
for ionized reflection then this would support the idea that a high accretion
rate is likely required to launch powerful radio jets.

  The system is initially in a homogeneous disordered phase and relaxes toward
a new equilibrium state as soon as the temperature is rapidly lowered. The time
evolution can be described numerically by a stochastic process such as the
Metropolis algorithm. The number of pure, equivalent, ground states is q for
the Potts model and r for the hard particle model, and it is known that for r

``macroscopic'' degeneracy, that is, one that comprises a huge number of

this phenomenon, and remains the paradigm. In recent years a new class of
magnetic substance has been characterised, in which the disorder of the
magnetic moments at low temperatures is precisely analogous to the proton

perhaps the ``cleanest'' examples of such highly frustrated systems yet

obtained: \beta=0.15(6), \gamma`=3.12(10), \gamma=1.57(10) and \alpha=0
(logarithmic divergence). Furthermore, values for the critical randomness
h_c=4.18(1) and the correlation-length exponent \nu=0.78(10) were found. These
independently obtained exponents are compatible with all (hyper-) scaling
relations and support the two-exponent scenario (\gamma`=2\gamma)

for $I = (0,s)$ and $I = (s,\infty)$, where $\chi_I^{(l)} = 1$ for $ \lambda_l
\in I$ and $\chi_I^{(l)} = 0$ otherwise. Using Okamoto's development of the
theory of the Painlev\'e V equation, it is shown that $\tilde{E}_N(I;a,\mu)$ is
a $\tau$-function associated with the Hamiltonian therein, and so can be
characterised as the solution of a certain second order second degree
differential equation, or in terms of the solution of certain difference
equations. The cases $\mu = 0$ and $\mu = 2$ are of particular interest as they
correspond to the cumulative distribution and density function respectively for
the smallest and largest eigenvalue. In the case $I = (s,\infty)$,
$\tilde{E}_N(I;a,\mu)$ is simply related to an average in the Jacobi unitary
ensemble, and this in turn is simply related to certain averages over the
orthogonal group, the unitary symplectic group and the circular unitary
ensemble. The latter integrals are of interest for their combinatorial content.
Also considered are the hard edge and soft edge scaled limits of
$\tilde{E}_N(I;a,\mu)$. In particular, in the hard edge scaled limit it is
shown that the limiting quantity $E^{\rm hard}((0,s);a,\mu)$ can be evaluated
as a $\tau$-function associated with the Hamiltonian in Okamoto's theory of the

extremes in this theory are the ordinary blow-up, corresponding to the

a nonsingular variety M. We prove that this latter blow-up is intrinsic of Y
and X, and is universal with respect to the requirement of being embedded as a
subscheme of the ordinary blow-up of some ambient space along Y.
  We consider these notions in the context of the theory of characteristic
classes of singular varieties. We prove that if X is a hypersurface in a
nonsingular variety and Y is its `singularity subscheme', these two extremes
embody respectively the conormal and characteristic cycles of X. Consequently,
the first carries the essential information computing Chern-Mather classes, and
the second is likewise a carrier for Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes. In our
approach, these classes are obtained from Segre class-like invariants, in
precisely the same way as other intrinsic characteristic classes such as those
proposed by William Fulton and by W. Fulton and Kent Johnson.
  We also identify a condition on the singularities of a hypersurface under
which the quasi-symmetric blow-up is simply the linear fiber space associated
with a coherent sheaf.

that these structures, i.e. reductive G-subbundles P of Q, admit a canonical
decomposition of the pull-back vector bundle $i_P^*(TQ) = P \times_Q TQ$ over
P. For classical G-structures, i.e. reductive G-subbundles of the linear frame
bundle, such a decomposition defines an infinitesimal canonical lift. This lift
extends to a prolongation $\Gamma$-structure on P. In this general geometric
framework the theory of Lie derivatives is considered. Particular emphasis is
given to the morphisms which must be taken in order to state what kind of Lie
derivative has to be chosen. On specializing the general theory of
gauge-natural Lie derivatives of spinor fields to the case of the Kosmann lift,
we recover the result originally found by Kosmann. We also show that in the
case of a reductive G-structure one can introduce a ""reductive Lie derivative""
with respect to a certain class of generalized infinitesimal automorphisms.
This differs, in general, from the gauge-natural one, and we conclude by
showing that the ""metric Lie derivative"" introduced by Bourguignon and
Gauduchon is in fact a particular kind of reductive rather than gauge-natural
Lie derivative.

It is found that the momentum-dependent baryon potentials effect the excitation
function of the $K^+$ cross section; at low bombarding energies of $\sim $ 1.0
GeV the attractive baryon potentials in the final state lead to a relative
enhancement of the kaon yield whereas the net repulsive potential at bombarding
energies $\sim$ 2 GeV causes a decrease of the $K^+$ cross section. Furthermore
it is pointed out, that especially the $K^+$ spectra at low momenta (or kinetic
energy $T_K$) allow to determine the in-medium $K^+$ potential almost model
independently due to a relative shift of the $K^+$ spectra in kinetic energy
that arises from the acceleration of the kaons when propagating out of the
nuclear medium to free space, i.e. converting potential energy to kinetic
energy of the free kaon.

They reported typical values of the slip length of the order of few

into the theory of propagation of elastic waves in a fluid-saturated porous
medium formulated by Biot is investigated. The new model should allow to fit
the experimental seismic data in circumstances when Biot's theory fails, as the
introduction of phenomenological dependence of the slip velocity upon
frequency, which is based on robust physical arguments, adds an additional
degree of freedom to the model. If fact, it predicts higher than the Biot's
theory values of attenuation coefficients of the both rotational and
dilatational waves in the intermediate frequency domain, which is in
qualitative agreement with the experimental data. Therefore, the introduction
of the boundary slip yields three-fold benefits: (A) Better agreement of theory
with an experimental data since the parametric space of the model is larger
(includes effects of boundary slip); (B) Possibility to identify types of
porous medium and physical situations where boundary slip is important; (C)
Constrain model parameters that are related to the boundary slip.
