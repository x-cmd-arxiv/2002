important not only for understanding the clusters, themselves, but also for
studying cosmology and galaxy formation. To clarify the problem of this

mapping an area of approximately 200'' x 100''$ in a 30'' grid, and triangular
mapping in a 20'' grid toward the Galactic center, resulted in 15 detections of
SiO sources; the positions of the sources were obtained with errors of 5--10'',
except for a few weak sources. Three-year monitoring observations found that
the component at V_lsr=-27 km/s of IRS 10 EE flared to about 1.5 Jy during 2000
March--May, which was a factor of more than 5 brighter than its normal
intensity. Using the radial velocities and positions of the SiO sources, we
identified 5 which are counterparts of previously observed OH 1612 MHz sources.
The other 10 SiO sources have no OH counterparts, but two were previously
detected with VLA, and four are located close to the positions of
large-amplitude variables observed at near-infrared wavelengths. A
least-squares fit to a plot of velocities versus Galactic longitudes gives a
rather high speed for the rotation of the star cluster around the Galactic
center. The observed radial-velocity dispersion is roughly consistent with a
value obtained before. It was found that all of the SiO sources with OH 1612
MHz counterparts have periods of light variation longer than 450 days, while
SiO sources without OH masers often have periods shorter than 450 days. This
fact suggests that lower-mass AGB stars are more often detected in SiO masers
than in the OH 1612 MHz line.

at which point the flux dropped quickly by a factor of 7, the frequency
saturated and, as the flux continued to decline, a weak spin-down began. The
pulses remained strong during the decay and the spin-up/flux correlation can be
fit to the Ghosh and Lamb derivations for the spin-up caused by accretion from
a thin, pressure-dominated disk, for a distance 3.2 kpc and a surface magnetic
field 1.2 10^{13} Gauss. During the bright spin-up part of the outburst, the
flux was subject to strong orbital modulation, peaking 3 days after periastron
of the eccentric 12.68 day orbit, while during the faint part, there was little
orbital modulation. The X-ray spectra were typical of accreting pulsars,
describable by a cut-off power-law, with an emission line near the 6.4 keV of K
alpha fluorescence from cool iron. The equivalent width of this emission did
not share the orbital modulation, but nearly doubled during the faint phase,
despite little change in the column density. The outburst could have been
caused by an episode of increased wind from a Be star, such that a small
accretion disk is formed during each periastron passage. A change in the wind
and disk structure apparently occurred after 5 months such that the accretion
rate was no longer modulated or the diffusion time was longer. The distance
estimate implies the X-ray luminosity observed was between 1 10^{36} ergs

scaling between bulge and black-hole mass. The best-fitting normalization of
the M_{bh}-M_{bulge} relation is found to be M_{bh}=0.0012M_{bulge}, in
agreement with recent black-hole mass studies based on stellar velocity

the full sample is found to be significantly smaller than has been previously

extending to about 2.8 kpc above the galactic plane. As the model input we use
a time-dependent velocity field of molecular gas resulting from self-consistent
3D N-body simulations of a galactic disk. We assume that the gaseous halo
rotates differentially co-rotating with the disk or decreasing its velocity in
the Z direction. The dynamo process included in the model yields the
amplification of the magnetic field as well as the formation of field
structures high above the galactic disk. The simulated magnetic fields are used
to construct the models of a high-frequency (Faraday rotation-free) polarized
radio emission that accounts for effects of projection and limited resolution,
and is thus suitable for direct comparison with observations. We found that the
resultant magnetic field correctly reproduces the observed structures of
polarization B-vectors, forming coherent patterns well aligned with spiral arms
and with the bar. The process initializing a wave-like behavior of the magnetic
field, which efficiently forms magnetic maxima between the spiral arms, is
demonstrated. The inclusion of the galactic halo constitutes a step towards a
realistic model of galactic magnetic fields that includes as many dynamical
components as needed for a realistic description.

has been investigated using multi-epoch ISO/SWS spectra of four Mira variables
in the 2.5-4.0 micron region. All four stars show H2O bands in absorption
around minimum in the visual light curve. At maximum, H2O emission features
appear in the ~3.5-4.0 micronm region, while the features at shorter
wavelengths remain in absorption. These H2O bands in the 2.5-4.0 micron region
originate from the extended atmosphere.
  The analysis has been carried out with a disk shape, slab geometry model. The
observed H2O bands are reproduced by two layers; a `hot' layer with an
excitation temperature of 2000 K and a `cool' layer with an excitation
temperature of 1000-1400 K. The radii of the `hot' layer (R_hot) are ~1 R_* at
visual minimum and 2 R_* at maximum, where R_* is a radius of background source
of the model. The time variation of R_hot/R_* from 1 to 2 is attributed to the
actual variation in the radius of the H2O layer. A high H2O density shell
occurs near the surface of the star around minimum, and moves out with the
stellar pulsation. This shell gradually fades away after maximum, and a new
high H2O density shell is formed in the inner region again at the next minimum.
Due to large optical depth of H2O, the near-infrared variability is dominated
by the H2O layer, and the L'-band flux correlates with the area of the H2O
shell. The infrared molecular bands trace the structure of the extended
atmosphere and impose appreciable effects on near-infrared light curve of Mira
variables.

least one supernova event recorded in the Asiago catalogue from January 1986 to

Salpeter Initial Mass Function and average binary rate approx. 50 %. On the
contrary, Seyfert galaxies exceed the ratio f in normal galaxies by a factor

Seyferts are still small (6 type Ib-Ic and 6 type II supernovae discovered as

inferences on the history of such crucial parameters of galactic evolution as
gas infall, gas outflows and global metallicities for these systems. We can
then trace the metallicity and abundance ratios of the stars formed, the gas
present at any time within the systems and the details of gas ejection, of
relevance to enrichment of the galaxies environment. We find that galaxies
showing one single burst of star formation (Ursa Minor and Leo II) require a
dark halo slightly larger that the current estimates for their tidal radii, or
the presence of a metal rich selective wind, which might carry away much of the
energy output of their supernovae before this might have interacted and heated
the gas content, for the gas to be retained until the observed stellar
population have formed. Systems showing extended star formation histories
(Carina and Leo I) however, are consistent with the idea that their tidally
limited dark haloes provide the necessary gravitational potential wells to
retain their gas. The complex time structure of the star formation in these
systems, remains difficult to understand. Observations of detailed abundance
ratios for Ursa Minor, strongly suggest that the star formation history of this

transition to the stable phase, even when the oscillating parameter of the free
energy remains below the corresponding critical value (for example, with
oscillating temperature, $T$ always remains below the critical temperature

imply prolonged mixed phase in a first order transition due to coupling with

be able to sustain liquids in a mixed phase indefinitely at low temperatures,

predict a very small bond alternation. Based upon our LDA results for the

arithmetic infinity involves exactly the same geometric data as the Euclidean
AdS_3 holography of black holes. Moreover, in the case of Euclidean AdS_2
holography, we present some results on bulk/boundary correspondence where the
boundary is a non-commutative space.

so as to suitably incorporate proper dynamical variables into the skyrmion
matter and then by taking these variables as variational parameters, we show
that they cover a configuration space sufficient to adequately describe the
ground state properties of nuclear matter starting from the skyrmion picture.
Our results turn out to be comparable to those so far found in different
numerical calculations, with our solution reaching stability at high density
for a crystal structure and obtaining a comparable value for the energy per
baryon at the minimum, thus setting the stage for the next step.

over a finite basis. With discretized variables, they provide an accurate
description of scattering in the s wave for short-range potentials with few
basis states. The R-matrix method combined with a Lagrange basis, i.e.
functions which vanish at all points of a mesh but one, leads to simple
mesh-like equations which also allow an accurate description of scattering.
These methods are shown to be exactly equivalent for any basis size, with or
without discretization. The comparison of their assumptions shows how to
accurately derive poles of the scattering matrix in the R-matrix formalism and
suggests how to extend the Siegert-pseudostate method to higher partial waves.
The different concepts are illustrated with the Bargmann potential and with the
centrifugal potential. A simplification of the R-matrix treatment can usefully
be extended to the Siegert-pseudostate method.
