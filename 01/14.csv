the inner few kpc of the brightest nearby M82-class starbursts and control
non-starbursts, based on high resolution CO (J=1--0) observations, optical and
NIR images, along with published radio continuum and Br-gamma data. I outline
the marked differences between molecular gas in the inner kpc and outer disk of
spiral galaxies in terms of gas surface densities, gas mass fractions,
epicyclic frequencies, and velocity dispersions. One implication is that in the
inner kpc, gravitational instabilities set in only at very high gas densities,
but once triggered they grow rapidly on a timescale of a few Myrs. This growth
timescale is now comparable to the lifetime of massive stars which destroy
molecular clouds and therefore, the fraction of gas converted into stars may be
ehhanced in the inner kpc. Furthermore, the high pressure, high turbulence ISM
may favor the formation of massive clusters. Most of the sample galaxies have
developed large gas concentrations inside the outer inner Lindblad resonance
(OILR) of the large-scale stellar bar. I discuss the differences in SFR per
unit mass of molecular gas or star formation efficiency (SFE) between the
starbursts and non-starbursts. The SFE is not a simple function of molecular
gas content. In the starbursts, the local gas density is close to the Toomre
critical density for the onset of gravitational instabilities. Conversely, in
the non-starbursts, sub-critical densities and large local velocity gradients
in the extended gas appear to inhibit SF in several gas-rich regions. A
comparison between nearby starbursts and the prototypical ULIRG Arp 220 is
presented.

with an indication of lower value at z = 3.3, while b_c(N) at a fixed column
density N(HI) = 10^(13.6) cm^(-2), b_c(13.6), increases as z decreases.
Assuming a QSO-dominated UV background, the slope of the equation of state
(gamma-1) shows no z-evolution within large uncertainties and the temperature
at the mean density, T_0, decreases as z decreases at three redshift ranges.
There is a large fluctuation of (Gamma-1) and b_c(13.6) even at the similar

b_c(13.6) values at z ~ 3.1 and 3.6 compared to ones at z ~ 3.4 and 3.9 are
caused by a lack of lower-N(HI) and lower-b lines, probably due to the HeII

the forest might be mainly on the lower-N(HI) forest. We find some forest
clouds with a high ratio of SiIV column density to CIV column density at z <

supernova cannot be fully resolved by our Earth-wide array. Model-dependent
sizes for the source have been determined and compared with previous results.
We conclude that the supernova shock was initially in free expansion for 6 +/-
2 yrs and then experienced a very strong deceleration. The onset of
deceleration took place a few years before the abrupt trend change in the
integrated radio flux density curves. We estimate the shocked swept-up mass to
be about 1.6 solar masses, assuming a standard density profile for the CSM.
Such a swept-up mass for SN1979C suggests a mass of the hydrogen-rich envelope
ejected at explosion no larger than $M_{\rm env} \sim$ 0.9 solar masses. If
SN1979C originated in a binary star the low value of M_env suggests that the
companion of the progenitor star stripped off most of the hydrogen-rich
envelope mass of the presupernova star prior to the explosion.

in the rest-frame K-band. To assign mass-to-light ratios, we use two different
approaches. First, we use an approach which maximizes the stellar mass for any
K-band luminosity at any redshift. We take the mass-to-light ratio of a Simple
Stellar Population (SSP) which is as old as the universe at the galaxy's
redshift as a likely upper limit. Second, we assign each galaxy a mass-to-light
ratio by fitting the galaxy's colours against a grid of composite stellar
population models and taking their M/L. We compute the number density of
galaxies more massive than 2 x 10^10 h^-2 Msun, 5 x 10^10 h^-2 Msun, and 1 x
10^11 h^-2 Msun, finding that the integrated stellar mass function is roughly
constant for the lowest mass limit and that it decreases with redshift by a
factor of ~ 3 and by a factor of ~ 6 for the two higher mass limits,
respectively. This finding is in qualitative agreement with models of
hierarchical galaxy formation, which predict that the number density of ~ M*
objects is fairly constant while it decreases faster for more massive systems

the folding pathways of the former can be grouped in two main classes according

in two dimensions for different particle diffusion strengths ($D$). We found
that $N>2$ cluster mean-field approximations must be considered to get
consistent singular behavior. The $N=3,4$ approximations result in a continuous
phase transition belonging to a single universality class along the $D\in
(0,1)$ phase transition line. Large scale simulations of the particle density
confirmed mean-field scaling behavior with logarithmic corrections. This is
interpreted as numerical evidence supporting that the upper critical dimension
in this model is $d_c=2$.The pair density scales in a similar way but with an
additional logarithmic factor to the order parameter. At the D=0 endpoint of
the transition line we found DP criticality.

exhibits charge fluctuations. These fluctuations are studied in the case of a
classical (i.e. non-quantum) system with no macroscopic average charge.
Assuming the validity of macroscopic electrostatics gives, on a
three-dimensional finite large conductor of volume $V$, a mean square charge
$<Q^2>$ which goes as $V^{1/3}$. More generally, in a short-circuited capacitor
of capacitance $C$, made of two conductors, the mean square charge on one
conductor is $<Q^2>=TC$, where $T$ is the temperature and $C$ the capacitance
of the capacitor. The case of only one conductor in the grand canonical
ensemble is obtained by removing the other conductor to infinity. The general
formula is checked in the weak-coupling (Debye-H\""uckel) limit for a spherical
capacitor. For two-dimensional Coulomb systems (with logarithmic interactions),
there are exactly solvable models which reveal that, in some cases, macroscopic
electrostatics is not applicable even for large conductors. This is when the
charge fluctuations involve only a small number of particles. The mean square
charge on one two-dimensional system alone, in the grand canonical ensemble, is

parton-shower/fragmentation. Flavor creation corresponds to the production of a
b-bbar pair by gluon fusion or by annihilation of light quarks, while flavor
excitation corresponds to a b or bbar quark being knocked out of the
initial-state by a gluon or a light quark or antiquark. The third source occurs
when a b-bbar pair is produced within a parton shower or during the
fragmentation process of a gluon or a light quark or antiquark (includes gluon
splitting). The QCD Monte-Carlo models indicate that all three sources of
b-quarks are important at the Tevatron and when combined they qualitatively
describe the inclusive cross-section data. Correlations between the b and bbar

eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. These methods are applied to a two-dimensional

resonances is generalized to the nonlocal and/or nonhermitian case, so that it
is applicable to the reduction of relativistic systems (Bethe-Salpeter

  It is also shown how to recover all solutions of the time-independent
Schroedinger equation in terms of solutions of the effective Schroedinger
equation in the reduced state space and a Schroedinger equation in a reference

  For practical calculations, it is important that the resulting formulas can
be used without computing any projection operators. This leads to a modified
coupled reaction channel/resonating group method framework for the calculation
of multichannel scattering information.
