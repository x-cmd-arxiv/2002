detected in our HST images. We compare the X-ray morphology with the radio as
derived from improved processing of archival VLA data and we construct spectral
energy distributions (SED) for the most conspicuous emission knots. In most
cases the SEDs, together with the similarity of the X-ray and radio
morphologies, favor an inverse Compton origin of the X-rays. The most likely
origin of the seed photons is the Cosmic Microwave Background, implying the
jets are still relativistic on kiloparsec scales. However, in the first knot of
the PKS 1136-135 jet, X-rays are likely produced via the synchrotron process.
In all four cases bulk Lorentz factors of a few are required. The radio maps of
the two jets not detected by either Chandra or HST suggest that they are less
beamed at large scales than the other four detected sources. Our results
demonstrate that, at the sensitivity and resolution of Chandra, X-ray emission
from extragalactic jets is common, yielding essential information on their

Moreover, we present the spatial structure in a series of images from different

triaxial ellipsoid projected almost pole-on. The matter close to major axis was
swept-up by some accelerating agent forming two faint and asymmetric polar
cups. A large cocoon of almost neutral gas completely embeds the ionized
nebula. NGC6565 is in a recombination phase. The stellar decline started about
1000 years ago, but the main nebula remained optically thin for other 600 years
before the recombination phase occurred. In the near future the ionization
front will re-grow, since the dilution factor due to the expansion will prevail
on the slower and slower stellar decline. NGC6565 is at a distance of
2.0(+-0.5) Kpc and can be divided into three radial zones: the ``fully
ionized'' one, extending up to 0.029--0.035 pc at the equator (0.050 pc at the
poles), the ``transition'' one, up to 0.048--0.054 pc (0.080 pc), the ``halo'',
detectable up to 0.110 pc. The ionized mass (~0.03 Modot) is only a fraction of
the total mass (> 0.15 Modot), which has been ejected by an equatorial enhanced
superwind of 4(+-2)x10^(-5) Modot/yr lasted for 4(+-2)x10^3 years.

  Growth, Core Elongation, and Binary Formation","5 pages, 2 figures, accepted by ApJL",,"10.1086/339659",,"astro-ph",,"  We have begun a systematic numerical study of the nonlinear growth of
nonaxisymmetric perturbations during the ambipolar diffusion-driven evolution
of initially magnetically subcritical molecular clouds, with an eye on the
formation of binaries, multiple stellar systems and small clusters. In this
initial study, we focus on the $m=2$ (or bar) mode, which is shown to be
unstable during the dynamic collapse phase of cloud evolution after the central
region has become magnetically supercritical. We find that, despite the
presence of a strong magnetic field, the bar can grow fast enough that for a
modest initial perturbation (at 5% level) a large aspect ratio is obtained
during the isothermal phase of cloud collapse. The highly elongated bar is
expected to fragment into small pieces during the subsequent adiabatic phase.
Our calculations suggest that the strong magnetic fields observed in some
star-forming clouds and envisioned in the standard picture of single star
formation do not necessarily suppress bar growth and fragmentation; on the
contrary, they may actually promote these processes, by allowing the clouds to
have more than one (thermal) Jeans mass to begin with without collapsing
promptly. Nonlinear growth of the bar mode in a direction perpendicular to the
magnetic field, coupled with flattening along field lines, leads to the
formation of supercritical cores that are triaxial in general. It removes a
longstanding objection to the standard scenario of isolated star formation
involving subcritical magnetic field and ambipolar diffusion based on the
likely prolate shape inferred for dense cores. Continuted growth of the bar
mode in already elongated starless cores, such as L1544, may lead to future
binary and multiple star formation.

equivalent width (EW) and flux of the Fe K line are shown to depend strongly on
the ratio of illuminating flux to disc flux, Fx/Fdisc, the photon index of the
irradiating power-law, \Gamma, and the incidence angle of the radiation, i.
When Fx/Fdisc \leq 2 a neutral Fe K line is prominent for all but the largest
values of \Gamma. At higher illuminating fluxes a He-like Fe K line at 6.7 keV
dominates the line complex. With a high-energy cutoff of 100 keV, the thermal
ionization instability seems to suppress the ionized Fe K line when \Gamma \leq
1.6. The Fe K line flux correlates with Fx/Fdisc, but the dependence weakens as
iron becomes fully ionized. The EW is roughly constant when Fx/Fdisc is low and
a neutral line dominates, but then declines as the line progresses through
higher ionization stages. There is a strong positive correlation between the Fe
K EW and \Gamma when the line energy is at 6.7 keV, and a slight negative one
when it is at 6.4 keV. This is a potential observational diagnostic of the
ionization state of the disc. Observations of the broad Fe K line which take
into account any narrow component would be able to test these predictions.
Ionized Fe K lines at 6.7 keV are predicted to be common in a simple magnetic
flare geometry. A model which includes multiple ionization gradients on the
disc is postulated to reconcile the results with observations.

the force versus extension curves within a continuous version of the freely
joining chain model, with monomer-monomer repulsive interactions. The problem
is formulated as a Statistical Field Theory model, endowed with a fixed cutoff
associated with the curvature of the extension versus force curve, in the free
polymer limit. Using a Field Theory version of the Hartree-Fock approximation,
the self-avoiding single polymer problem reduces to the solving of a
one-dimension self-consistent integral equation. Taking the short range
potential limit, we obtain an explicit analytical solution, involving the roots
of an algebraic equation. In the low force regime, we find that the slope of
the relative extension at zero force increases steadily with the total monomer
number N, while it stays constant for a free polymer. We compare, for N=100,
our analytic results with those obtained by Monte Carlo simulations of a

a difference between the repulsive potential ranges, an appropriate choice of

relaxation rates ($1/T_1$) for both $^{11}$B and $^{27}$Al nuclei are reported
also for AlB$_2$. The comparison of the data in the two compounds shows the
dramatic drop of the density of states at the boron site in AlB$_2$ with
respect to MgB$_2$. The experimental values for $K$ and $1/T_1$ are in most
cases in good agreement with the theoretical values obtained from first
principles calculations. The recovery of the nuclear magnetization below $T_c$
in random powder samples is non-exponential due to the anisotropy of the upper
critical field. The exponential drop of $1/T_1$ in the superconducting phase
observed by Kotegawa et al. is confirmed here but not the coherence peak.

polypropylene at room temperature in the vicinity of the yield point. In the
first series of experiments, injection-molded samples are used without thermal
pre-treatment. In the second and third series, prior to testing the specimens
are annealed at 130 C for 4 and 24 hours, respectively. Constitutive equations
are derived for the time-dependent response of semicrystalline polymers at
isothermal loading. A polymer is treated as an equivalent temporary network of
macromolecules bridged by junctions (physical cross-links, entanglements and
crystalline lamellae). Under loading, junctions slip with respect to their
positions in the bulk material (which reflects the viscoplastic behavior),
whereas chains separate from their junctions and merge with new ones at random
times (which reflects the viscoelastic response). The network is thought of as
an ensemble of meso-regions (MR) with various activation energies for
detachment of chains from temporary nodes. Adjustable parameters in the
stress-strain relations are found by fitting observations. Experimental data
demonstrate that the shape of the relaxation spectrum (characterized by the
distribution of MRs with various potential energies) is independent of
mechanical factors, but is altered at annealing. For specimens not subjected to
thermal treatment, the growth of longitudinal strain does not affect the volume
fraction of active MRs and the attempt rate for detachment of chains from their
junctons. For annealed samples, the concentration of active MRs increases and
the attempt rate decreases with strain. These changes in the time-dependent
response are attributed to broadening of the distribution of strengths of
crystalline lamellae at annealing.

to obtain the desired quantities. To address this problem, we have devised a
variety of high-level algorithms that serve as an interface between the user
and a traditional MC code. The user specifies the goals sought in a high-level
form that our algorithms convert into elementary tasks to be performed by a
standard MC code. For instance, our algorithms permit the determination of the
free energy of an alloy phase over its entire region of stability within a
specified accuracy, without requiring any user intervention during the
calculations. Our algorithms also enable the direct determination of
composition-temperature phase boundaries without requiring the calculation of
the whole free energy surface of the alloy system.

potential due to the small linear term in the K\""ahler potential. Then,
primordial fluctuations within the present horizon scale may be produced during
both inflations. Primordial fluctuations responsible for anisotropies of the
cosmic microwave background radiation and the large scale structure are
produced during chaotic inflation, while fluctuations on smaller scales are
produced during new inflation. Because of the peculiar nature of new inflation,
they can become as large as $10^{-1}$-$10^{-2}$, which may lead to the

spectrum of highly excited baryons may be due to effective chiral symmetry
restoration for these states. We review the recent developments in this field.
We demonstrate with a simple quantum-mechanical example that it is a very
natural property of quantum systems that a symmetry breaking effect which is
important for the low-lying spectrum of the system, can become unimportant for
the highly-lying states; the highly lying states reveal a multiplet structure
of nearly degenerate states. Using the well established concepts of
quark-hadron duality, asymptotic freedom in QCD and validity of the operator
product expansion in QCD we show that the spectral densities obtained with the
local currents that are connected to each other via chiral transformations,
very high in the spectrum must coincide. Hence effects of spontaneous breaking
of chiral symmetry in QCD vacuum that are crucially important for the low-lying
spectra, become irrelevant for the highly-lying states. Then to the extent that
identifiable hadronic resonances still exist in the continuum spectrum at high
excitations this implies that the highly excited hadrons must fall into
multiplets associated with the representations of the chiral group. We
demonstrate that this is indeed the case for meson spectra in the large $N_c$
limit. All possible parity-chiral multiplets are classified for baryons and it
is demonstrated that the existing data on highly excited $N$ and $\Delta$
states at masses of 2 GeV and higher is consistent with approximate chiral
symmetry restoration. However new experimental studies are needed to achieve
any definitive conclusions.

  request to na@physics.utexas.edu",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The hydrodynamic formulation of quantum mechanics is used to elucidate the
mechanism for decoherence, the suppression of interference effects in a system
evolving from an initial coherent superposition. Analysis of time-dependent
trajectory ensembles, flux maps, and elements of the stress tensor for two
composite systems, in one of which the system is uncoupled to the environment,
leads to the decoherence mechanism. For the uncoupled case, the quantum force
acting on the fluid elements directs flux toward an attractor where the
interference feature arises. For the coupled case, the classical force acting
on each fluid element counters the quantum force and leads to gradual
separation of the components of the initial superposition. Concomitantly, fluid
stress is relieved when flux vectors diverge from a repellor in the mid-region
between the separating wavepackets, thus suppressing formation of the
interference feature.

deterministically or probabilistically simulate another one when local
operations of a certain kind -in some cases including also classical
communication- are allowed. In the case of probabilistic simulation and
allowing for arbitrary local operations, we provide necessary and sufficient
conditions for the simulation to be possible. Deterministic and probabilistic
interconversion under certain kinds of local operations are used to define
equivalence relations between gates. In the probabilistic, bipartite case this
induces a finite number of classes. In multiqubit systems, however, two unitary
operations typically cannot simulate each other with non-zero probability of
success. We also show which kind of entanglement can be created by a given
non--local unitary operation and generalize our results to arbitrary operators.
