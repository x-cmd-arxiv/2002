remained a mystery, despite extensive study over the past two decades. A
fundamental question is the relative contribution of the point-source and
diffuse components of this emission, which is critical to understanding the
high-energy phenomena and processes unique to this Galactic nuclear
environment. Here, we report on results from a large-scale imaging survey of
the Galactic center with sufficient spatial resolution to allow a clean
separation of the two components. The highly-ionized Fe emission, previously
attributed to the diffuse emission, is found largely due to the discrete X-ray
source population. The number and spectrum of such sources indicate the
presence of numerous accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars, and/or black holes
in the region. The diffuse X-ray emission dominates over the contribution from
the faint discrete sources and is shown to be associated with distinct
interstellar structures observed at radio and mid-infrared wavelengths,
suggesting that it arises from the recent formation of massive stars. We have
also mapped out the 6.4-keV fluorescence line emission from neutral to
moderately ionized irons. The ubiquitous association of the emission with
molecular gas indicates that either the X-ray radiation from the Galactic
center was substantially more intense in the past than at present or
non-relativistic cosmic-rays are important in producing Fe K shell vacancies.

not arise; 2) some statistical issues of the physical fields, like the

equation of state of the gas, the poor correlation of magnetic strength with
density, the energy spectrum in weakly and highly compressible cases, and the
one point statistics of the velocity field; 3) the effects of spectroscopic

controlling it, the possibility of short time scales ($\sim $ a few Myr) for
molecular cloud formation, and the star-gas connection, mentioning that the

string and M theory may be interpreted as non-local hidden variables theories
in which the quantum observables are the eigenvalues of the matrices while
their entries are the non-local hidden variables. This is shown by studying the
bosonic matrix model at finite temperature, with T taken to scale as 1/N. For
large N the eigenvalues of the matrices undergo Brownian motion due to the
interaction of the diagonal elements with the off diagonal elements, giving
rise to a diffusion constant that remains finite as N goes to infinity. The
resulting probability density and current for the eigenvalues are then found to
evolve in agreement with the Schroedinger equation, to leading order in 1/N.
The quantum fluctuations and uncertainties in the eigenvalues are then
consequences of ordinary statistical fluctuations in the values of the
off-diagonal matrix elements. This formulation of the quantum theory is
background independent, as the definition of the thermal ensemble makes no use
of a particular classical solution. The derivation relies on Nelson's
stochastic formulation of quantum theory, which is expressed in terms of a
variational principle.

gauge connection. We derive, in detail, both the five-dimensional effective
action and the associated actions of the four-dimensional ""end-of-the-world""
branes. Lecture 2 is devoted to showing that this theory naturally admits
static, N=1 supersymmetry preserving BPS three-branes, the minimal vacuum
having two such branes. One of these, the ""visible"" brane, is shown to support
a three-generation E_6 grand unified theory, whereas the other emerges as the
""hidden"" brane with unbroken E_8 gauge group. Thus heterotic M-theory emerges
as a fundamental paradigm for so-called ""brane world"" scenarios of particle
physics. In Lecture 3, we introduce the concept of ""non-standard"" embeddings.
These are shown to permit a vast generalization of allowed vacua, leading on
the visible brane to new grand unified theories, such as SO(10) and SU(5), and
to the standard model SU(3)_C X SU(2)_L X U(1)_Y. It is demonstrated that
non-standard embeddings generically imply the existence of five-branes in the

detail. Finally, in Lecture 4 we move beyond Horava-Witten theory and consider
orbifolds larger than S^1/Z_2. For explicitness, we consider M-theory orbifolds

plane we present two Lagrangian actions, one of which admits addition of an
arbitrary potential. Quantization leads to quantum mechanics with ordinary

Lagrangian formulations for a particle on NC sphere as well as for a particle

shown to be equivalent to the model of usual rotor. There are several natural
possibilities to choose physical variables, which lead either to commutative or

small accelerators, measuring ever-decreasing cross sections as one approached
(but rarely reached) the energy of reactions in stars. But in recent years
pioneering studies have shown that studies at high-energy accelerators can
often yield the same information, and in some important cases, provide
information not otherwise available. This is particularly so for studies of the
properties and reactions of the short-lived radioactive nuclei that play a
crucial role in explosive phenomena such as novae, supernovae, and neutron
stars. I'll give an overview of some of the possibilities, and then concentrate
on two extended examples: measurements of the rates of radioactive capture
reactions using Coulomb breakup reactions, and the relationship of charge
exchange cross sections and beta-decay strength for L = 1 transitions.

C65 (2002) 054901","10.1103/PhysRevC.65.054901",,"nucl-th hep-ph nucl-ex",,"  The Hidden Local Symmetry Lagrangian is used to study the interactions of phi
mesons with other pseudoscalar and vector mesons in a hadronic gas at finite
temperature. We have found a significantly small phi mean free path (less than
2.4 fm at T > 170 MeV) due to large collision rates with rho mesons, kaons and
predominantly K* in spite of their heavy mass. This implies that phi mesons
produced after hadronization in relativistic heavy ion collisions will not
leave the hadronic system without scattering. The effect of these interactions
on the time evolution of the phi density in the expanding hadronic fireball is
investigated.

complex internal structure. This structure is determined by short-range
interactions which are appropriately described in terms of local gauge fields
of the first kind. Any modification of their state would produce, in general, a
new type of internal error, called local error, in the quantum state of the
computer. We suggest that the general treatement of the local errors produced
by a gauge multiplet can be done in the framework of the Algebraic Quantum
Field Theory. A recovery operator is constructed from the first principles.
