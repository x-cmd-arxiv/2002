comparable (within the limited statistics) to the XMM-Newton parameters. The
comparison of our iron line upper limit with reported detections indicates
variability of the line EW. These results can be explained by the relatively
low nuclear absorption of NGC 4258 (which is in the range expected for its
intermediate Seyfert type) and some variability of the absorbing material.
Reflection components as proposed to explain the large iron line EW of highly

observations of QSO FIRST J104459.6+365605 by de Kool and coworkers, when
intepreted in the context of a single-phase gas model, imply that the
absorption occurs much farther (approx 700 pc) from the center. We reinterpret
these observations in terms of a shielded, multiphase gas, which we represent
as a continuous low-density wind with embedded high-density clouds. Our model
satisfies all the observational constraints with an absorbing gas that extends
only out to about 4 pc from the central source. The different density
components in this model coexist in the same region of space and have similar
velocities, which makes it possible to account for the detection in this source
of absorption features that correspond to different ionization parameters but
have a similar velocity structure. This model also implies that only a small
fraction of the gas along the line of sight to the center is outflowing at the
observed speeds and that the clouds are dusty whereas the uniform gas component
is dust free. We suggest that a similar picture may apply to other sources and
discuss additional possible clues to the existence of multiphase outflows in
AGNs.

early- and late-type systems. Our data confirm that the mean effective
dynamical mass-to-light ratio M/L of the E+S0+S0a galaxies increases with
increasing effective dynamical mass M, as expected from the existence of the
Fundamental Plane relation. Conversely, spiral and Im/BCD galaxies show a broad
distribution in M/L with no detected trend of M/L with M, the former galaxies
having M/L values about twice larger than the latter, on average. For all the
late-type galaxies, the M/L increases with decreasing effective surface

These results are discussed on the basis of the assumptions behind the
construction of the k-space and their limitations. Our study is complementary
to a previous investigation in the optical (B-band: lambda = 0.44 micron) and
allows us to study wavelength-dependences of the galaxy distribution in the

galaxies of increasing dynamical mass. Conversely, it appears that the M/L of
late-types is higher (lower) than that of early-types with the same M in the

the environmental impact that radio galaxy activity has on the host galaxy or

supersonic, back-to-back jets propagating in a beta-model galaxy/cluster
atmosphere. We then shut down the jet activity and let the resulting structure
evolve passively. The dead source undergoes an initial phase of pressure driven
expansion until it achieves pressure equilibrium with its surroundings.
Thereafter, buoyancy forces drive the evolution and lead to the formation of
two oppositely directed plumes that float high into the galaxy/cluster
atmosphere. These plumes entrain a significant amount of low entropy material
from the galaxy/cluster core and lift it high into the atmosphere. An important
result is that a large fraction (at least half) of the energy injected by the
jet activity is thermalized in the ISM/ICM core. The whole ISM/ICM atmosphere
inflates in order to regain hydrostatic equilibrium. This inflation is mediated
by an approximately spherical disturbance which propagates into the atmosphere
at the sound speed. The fact that such a large fraction of the injected energy
is thermalized suggests that radio galaxies may have an important role in the
overall energy budget of rich ISM/ICM atmospheres. In particular, they may act
as a strong and highly time-dependent source of negative feedback for
galaxy/cluster cooling flows.

Therefore, because the adaptive optics system is measuring the wavefront

dependence of dust extinction is introduced based on the size-luminosity
relation of optical galaxies, and that (2) the big grain dust temperature
T_dust is calculated based on a physical consideration for energy balance,
rather than using the empirical relation between T_dust and total infrared
luminosity L_IR found in local galaxies, which has been employed in most of
previous works. Consequently, the local properties of infrared galaxies, i.e.,
optical/infrared luminosity ratios, L_IR-T_dust correlation, and infrared
luminosity function are outputs predicted by the model. Our model indeed
reproduces these local properties reasonably well. We then found considerably
different results for MIR-submm counts and CBR from most of previous works
based on the empirical L_IR-T_dust relation; especially, it is shown that the
dust temperature of starbursting primordial elliptical galaxies is expected to
be very high (40-80K). This indicates that intense starbursts of forming
elliptical galaxies should have occurred at z~2-3, in contrast to the previous
results that significant starbursts beyond z~1 tend to overproduce the
far-infrared (FIR) CBR detected by COBE/FIRAS. On the other hand, our model
predicts that the mid-infrared (MIR) flux from warm/nonequilibrium dust is
relatively weak in such galaxies making FIR CBR, and this effect reconciles the
prima facie conflict between the upper limit on MIR CBR from TeV gamma-ray
observations and the COBE detections of FIR CBR. (abridged)

correlated with a very low scatter for the star forming objects and with a much
higher scatter for the starburst galaxies. The Halpha to UV flux ratio is found

significantly increased in the envelope. This process then allows low- and

phase... In the 7Mo model, the CNO envelope abundance following the second
dredge-up is so large that the star does not experience the carbon injection

burning is activated in stars more massive than ~ 2Mo. This evolutionary

show that the study of absorption features (or continuum absorption) can reveal
the radial structure of the close environment, unaccessible with different

bursts taking place in dense regions. In particular, we show that the radius

the column density in the prompt burst phase. The derived cloud properties are
similar to those of the star forming cocoons and globules within molecular

superconductor with strong antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuations and
calculate the spin susceptibility around the impurity. We show that the uniform
susceptibility, which is usually suppressed in spin-singlet superconductivity,
is enhanced at low temperatures around the impurity when the impurity
scattering is in the unitarity limit. This anomalous behavior is more
remarkable when the impurity potential is extended spatially and the AF spin
fluctuations are stronger. As the origin of this phenomenon, we point out the
importance of (1) a low-energy bound state around the impurity and (2) a
mode-mode coupling effect which connects the AF spin fluctuations with the
uniform susceptibility. Our results can explain the anomalous temperature
dependence of the Knight shift on Li which was recently observed in

hyperfine coupling.
  We evaluate the spin correlation function with and without magnetic fields
and find that the decay of the spin precession amplitude is not exponential but
rather power (inverse logarithm) law-like. For fully polarized nuclei we find
an exact solution and show that the precession amplitude and the decay behavior
can be tuned by the magnetic field.
  The corresponding decay time is given by $\hbar N/A$, where $A$ is a
hyperfine interaction constant and $N$ the number of nuclei inside the dot. The
amplitude of precession, reached as a result of the decay, is finite. We show
that there is a striking difference between the decoherence time for a single

the minimally coupled GR equations asymptotically de Sitter in the origin and
asymptotically Schwarzschild at infinity. A source term connects smoothly de
Sitter vacuum at the regular center with Minkowski vacuum at infinity and
corresponds to anisotropic spherically symmetric vacuum defined macroscopically
by the algebraic structure of its stress-energy tensor invariant under boosts
in the radial direction. De Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry describes a vacuum
nonsingular black hole which evolves, in the course of Hawking evaporation,
towards a self-gravitating particle-like structure without horizons, G-lump.
Space-time symmetry changes smoothly from the de Sitter group in the center to
the Lorentz group at infinity, and the standard formula for the ADM mass
relates it to the de Sitter vacuum replacing a singularity at the scale of
symmetry restoration. This class of metrics is easily extended to the case of a
nonzero background cosmological constant. A source term connects then smoothly
two de Sitter vacua with different values of cosmological constant which makes
possible to associate anisotropic spherically symmetric vacuum with an
r-dependent cosmological term.

become superconducting at moderately low temperatures, thus enhancing their
stability. We then present a new class of defects - drum vortons - which arise
when a small symmetry breaking term is added to the potential. We display these
points within the context of the O(4) sigma model, relevant for hadrodynamics
below the QCD scale. This model admits `embedded defects' (topological defect
configurations of a simpler - in this case O(2) symmetric - model obtained by
imposing an embedding constraint) that are unstable in the full model at zero
temperature, but that can be stabilised (by electromagnetic coupling to
photons) in a thermal gas at moderately high termperatures. It is shown here
that below the embedded defect stabilisation threshold, there will still be
stabilized cosmic string defects. However, they will not be of the symmetric
embedded vortex type, but of an `asymmetric' vortex type, and are automatically
superconducting. In the presence of weak symmetry breaking terms, such as arise
naturally when using the O(4) model for hadrodynamics, the strings become the
boundary of a new kind of cosmic sigma membrane, with tension given by the pion
mass. The string current would then make it possible for a loop to attain a
(classically) stable equilibrium state that differs from an ``ordinary'' vorton
state by the presence of a sigma membrane stretched across it in a drum like
configuration. Such defects will however be entirely destabilised if the
symmetry breaking is too strong, as is found to be the case -- due to the
rather large value of the pion mass -- in the hadronic application of the O(4)
sigma model.

and use it to determine the Friedmann equation on a 3-brane embedded in
different bulk spacetimes all with one or more extra dimensions. Usually, when
there is more than one extra dimension the junction conditions, central to the
usual brane world scenarios, are difficult to apply. This problem does not
arise in mirage cosmology because the brane is treated as a ``test particle''
in the background spacetime. We discuss in detail the dynamics of a brane
embedded in two specific 10D bulk spacetimes, namely Sch-AdS$_5 \times$S$_5$
and a rotating black hole, and from the dynamics--which are now rather more
complicated since the brane can move in all the extra dimensions--determine the
new ``dark fluid'' terms in the brane Friedmann equation. Some of these, such
as the cosmological constant term, are seen to be bulk dependent. However, for
both bulks we show that there exists a critical brane angular momentum,
$\ell_c$, and discuss its significance. We then show explicitly how this mirage
cosmology approach matches with the familiar junction condition approach when
there is just one extra dimension. The issue of a varying speed of light in
mirage cosmology is reviewed and we find a scenario in which $c_{\bf eff}$
always increases, tending asymptotically to a constant $c_0$ as the universe
expands. Finally some comments are made regarding brane inflation and
limitations of the mirage cosmology approach are also discussed.

framework of low--energy string theory the double Ernst system can be
particularly interpreted as the rotating field configuration of two interacting

clarify the rotating character of the $B_{t\phi}$--component of the

strong gravity, in the low matter density regime, for slowly varying matter
sources. This is relevant for astrophysical or cosmological applications. The
warped compactification means the radion can not be written as a homogeneous
mode in the orbifold coordinate, and we introduce it by extending the
coordinate patch approach of the linear theory to the non-linear case. The
negative tension brane is taken to be in vacuum. For conformally invariant
matter on the positive tension brane, we solve the bulk geometry as a
derivative expansion, formally summing the `Kaluza-Klein' contributions to all
orders. For general matter we compute the Einstein equations to leading order,
finding a scalar-tensor theory with $\omega(\Psi) \propto \Psi / (1 - \Psi)$,
and geometrically interpret the radion. We comment that this radion scalar may
become large in the context of strong gravity with low density matter.
Equations of state allowing $(\rho - 3 P)$ to be negative, can exhibit behavior
where the matter decreases the distance between the 2 branes, which we
illustrate numerically for static star solutions using an incompressible fluid.
For increasing stellar density, the branes become close before the upper mass
limit, but after violation of the dominant energy condition. This raises the
interesting question of whether astrophysically reasonable matter, and initial
data, could cause branes to collide at low energy, such as in dynamical
collapse.

geometry of the 2D-MOT on the mean velocity of the cold beam has been studied.
We present a simple model for the velocity distribution of the flux based on
rate equations describing the general dependencies.

its tip suspended a distance S above a two-fluid interface. At sufficiently low
withdrawal rates, Q, the interface forms a steady state hump and only the upper
fluid is withdrawn. When Q is increased (or S decreased), the interface
undergoes a transition so that the lower fluid is entrained with the upper one,
forming a thin steady-state spout. Near this transition the hump curvature
becomes very large and displays power-law scaling behavior. This scaling allows
for steady-state hump profiles at different flow rates and tube heights to be
scaled onto a single similarity profile. I show that the scaling behavior is
independent of the viscosity ratio.

grows quadratically in rise/fall times of pulses.

multipartite entanglement of four qubits as a quantum channel. Based on the
invariance of entanglement teleportation under arbitrary two-qubit unitary
transformation, we derive relations of separabilities for joint measurements at
a sending station and for unitary operations at a receiving station. From the
relations of separabilities it is found that an inseparable quantum channel
always leads to a total teleportation of entanglement with an inseparable joint
measurement and/or a nonlocal unitary operation.
