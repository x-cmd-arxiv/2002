around the z = 0.938 field elliptical galaxy CFRS03.1077 during HST
observations of Canada-France Redshift Survey (CFRS) fields. Spectroscopic
observations of the arc show that the redshift of the resolved lensed galaxy is
z = 2.941. This gravitational lens-source system is well-fitted using the
position angle and ellipticity derived from the visible matter distribution and
an isothermal mass profile with a mass corresponding to sigma =387+-5 km/s.
Surprisingly, given the evidence for passive evolution of elliptical galaxies,
this is in good agreement with an estimate based on the fundamental plane for z
= 0 ellipticals. This, perhaps, indicates that this galaxy has not shared in
the significant evolution observed for average elliptical galaxies at z ~ 1. A
second elliptical galaxy with similar luminosity from the CFRS survey, CFRS
14.1311 at z=0.807, is also a lens but in this case the lens model gives a much
smaller mass-to-light ratio, i.e., it appears to confirm the expected
evolution. This suggests that this pair of field elliptical galaxies may have
very different evolutionary histories, a significant result if confirmed.
Clearly, CFRS03.1077 demonstrates that these ""Einstein rings"" are powerful
probes of high redshift galaxies.

  Astrophysics Main Journal",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20020152",,"astro-ph",,"  We show that the well-known discrepancy between the radial dependence of the
Galactic cosmic ray (CR) nucleon distribution, as inferred most recently from
EGRET observations of diffuse gamma-rays above 100 MeV, and of the most likely
CR source distribution (supernova remnants, pulsars) can be explained purely by
PROPAGATION effects. Contrary to previous claims, we demonstrate that this is
possible, if the dynamical coupling between the escaping CRs and thermal plasma
is taken into account, and thus a self-consistent GALACTIC WIND calculation is
carried out. Given a dependence of the CR source distribution on Galactocentric
radius, r, our numerical wind solutions show that the CR outflow velocity,
V(r,z) depends both on r, and on vertical distance, z, at reference level z_C.
The latter is defined as the transition boundary from diffusion to advection
dominated CR transport and is therefore also a function of r. In fact, the CR
escape time averaged over particle energies decreases with increasing CR source
strength. Such an increase is counteracted by a reduced average CR residence
time in the gas disk. Therfore pronounced peaks in the radial source
distribution result in mild radial gamma-ray gradients at GeV energies, as it
has been observed. This effect is enhanced by anisotropic diffusion, assuming
different radial and vertical diffusion coefficients. We have calculated 2D
analytic solutions of the stationary diffusion-advection equation, including
anisotropic diffusion, for a given CR source distribution and a realistic
outflow velocity field V(r,z), inferred from self-consistent numerical Galactic
Wind simulations. At TeV energies the gamma-rays from the sources are expected
to dominate the observed ""diffuse"" flux from the disk. Its observation should
allow an empirical test of the theory presented.

are lifted at these higher resolutions. 34% of the galaxies do not have a
meaningful fit when using the NFW profile and 32% when using the
pseudoisothermal profile, however only 14% do not have a meaningful fit in
either model. In both models we find correlations between the disk baryon

the dark halo mass $M_{200}$, and between $M_{200}$ and the concentration

$c$, for a NFW halo, is in good agreement with CDM predictions; no significant
galaxy population is found with very low values of $c$. The overall
distribution of $\lambda'$ is in good agreement with theoretical predictions
from hierarchical tidal torque theory. The whole sample is also well fitted by
a pseudo-isothermal dark halo with a core, but the size of the core is rather
small (for 70% of the sample the core size is less than 2 kpc). Thus we
conclude that the profile of dark matter is steep ($r^{-1}$ or steeper) down to
this radius; large dark matter cores (and therefore very low dark matter
central densities) seem to be excluded. LSBs tend to have higher values of
$\lambda'$ for a given $f_d$ and lower values of $c$ for a given mass than
HSBs. In an appendix we give some useful formula for pseudo-isothermal profile

comparison of the kinematics of gas at large galactocentric impact parameters
with the galaxy kinematics obtained from the faint galaxy spectroscopy. All 5
galaxies appear to be relatively normal spirals, with measured rotation curves
yielding circular velocities in the range 100 < v_c < 260 km/s. We find that in
4 of the 5 cases examined, the velocities of all of the Mg II absorption
components lie entirely to one side of the galaxy systemic redshift. These
observations are consistent with rotation being dominant for the absorbing gas
kinematics; however, the total range of velocities observed is inconsistent
with simple disk rotation in every case. Simple kinematic models that
simultaneously explain both the systemic offset of the absorbing material
relative to the galaxy redshifts, and the total velocity width spanned by the
absorption, require either extremely thick rotating gas layers, rotation
velocities that vary with height above the extrapolation of the galactic plane,
or both. In any case, our small sample suggests that rotating ``halo'' gas is a
common feature of intermediate redshift spiral galaxies, and that the kinematic
signature of rotation dominates over radial infall or outflow even for gas well
away from the galactic plane. We discuss possible explanations for this
behavior, and compare our observations to possible local analogs.

sequences in theresulting colour-magnitude diagram for the cluster are
significantly better determined than in previously published data. From
comparison of the colour-magnitude diagram with the fiducial line for NGC 6553
from Zoccali et al. (2001) we conclude that the two globular clusters have the
same age. Further, using alpha-enhanced stellar isochrones, NGC 6528 is found
to have an age of 11+-2 Gyr. This fitting of isochrones also give that the
cluster is 7.2 kpc away from us. From the measured velocities both the proper
motion of the cluster and the velocity dispersion in the Galactic bulge are
found. NGC 6528 is found to have a proper motion relative to the Galactic bulge
of mu_l=0.006 and mu_b=0.044 arcsec per century. Using stars with 14<V_555<19

bulge, sigma_l= 0.33+-0.03 and sigma_{b}= 0.25+-0.02 arcsec per century. This
give sigma_l/sigma_b=1.32+-0.16, consistent both with previous proper motion
studies of K giants in the Galactic bulge as well as with predictions by models
of the kinematics of bulge stars.

associated with the existence of a poorly crystallized defect-ordered phase

model is the assumption that the penetrating ac magnetic field modifies the
vortex lattice mobility, trapping different robust dynamical states in
different regions of the sample. We discuss in detail on the response of the
superconductor to an ac magnetic field when the vortex lattice mobility is not
uniform inside the sample. We begin with an analytical description for a simple
geometry (slab) and then we perform numerical calculations for a strip in a
transverse magnetic field which include relaxation effects. In calculations,
the vortex system is assumed to coexist in different pinning regimes. The
vortex behavior in the regions where the induced current density j has been
always below a given threshold (j_c^>) is described by an elastic Campbell-like
regime (or a critical state regime with local high critical current density,
j_c^>). When the VS is shaken by symmetrical (e.g. sinusoidal) ac fields, the
critical current density is modified to j_c^< (which is smaller than j_c^>) at
regions where vortices have been forced to oscillate by a current density
larger than j_c^>. Experimentally, an initial state with high critical current
density (j_c^>) can be obtained by zero field cooling, field cooling (with no

sawtooth) field. We compare our calculations with experimental ac

of the Josephson current through the junction reveals the existence of the
$\pi$ phase differences in the multi-gap superconductor. This mechanism may be
relevant for understanding several experiments on the Josephson junctions with
unconventional superconductors. We also discuss how the presence of the

annihilated by the total Hamiltonian, we consider the internal dynamics of a

a uniquely defined time parameter and all physical questions about it must be
posed without reference to time. We consider in particular the question, what
is the probability that the system's trajectory passes through a set of regions
of configuration space without reference to time? We first consider the
classical case, where the answer has a variety of forms in terms of a phase
space probability distribution function. We then consider the quantum case, and
we analyze this question using the decoherent histories approach to quantum
theory, adapted to questions which do not involve time. When the histories are
decoherent, the probabilities approximately coincide with the classical case,
with the phase space probability distribution replaced by the Wigner function
of the quantum state. For some initial states, decoherence requires an
environment, and we compute the required influence functional and examine some
of its properties. Special attention is given to the inner product used in the
construction (the induced or Rieffel inner product), the construction of class
operators describing the histories, and the extent to which reparametrization
invariance is respected. Our results indicate that simple systems without an
explicit time parameter may be quantized using the decoherent histories
approach, and the expected classical limit extracted. The results support, for
simple models, the usual heuristic proposals for the probability distribution
function associated with a semiclassical wave function satisfying the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation.

most generalizations lead to theories describing superpositions of particles of
different intrinsic spin and isospin, so that the correct interpretation
emerges from the requirement of full Poincare covariance, including space and
time reversal, as well as of reversion and gauge invariance. For instance, the
doubling of the number of solutions implied by the simplest generalization of
Dirac's equation (i.e., Lanczos's equation) can be interpreted as isospin. In
this approach, biquaternions and Clifford numbers become powerful opportunities
to formulate the Standard Model of elementary particles, as well as many of its

it does not contain a critical Heegaard surface. In the final section we
discuss how this work leads to a natural metric on the space of strongly
irreducible Heegaard splittings, as well as many new and interesting open
questions.

Heath--Jarrow--Morton models that admit arbitrary initial yield curves. It is
well known that affine term structure models with time-dependent coefficients
(such as the Hull--White extension of the Vasicek short rate model) perfectly
fit any initial term structure. We find that such affine models are in fact the
only finite-factor term structure models with this property. We also show that
there is usually an invariant singular set of initial yield curves where the
affine term structure model becomes time-homogeneous. We also argue that other
than functional dependent volatility structures -- such as local state
dependent volatility structures -- cannot lead to finite-dimensional
realizations. Finally, our geometric point of view is illustrated by several

coherent theory of mathematics and physics together is described. The main
characteristic of such a theory is discussed: the theory must be valid and and
sufficiently strong, and it must maximally describe its own validity and
sufficient strength. The mathematical logical definition of validity is used,
and sufficient strength is seen to be a necessary and useful concept. The
requirement of maximal description of its own validity and sufficient strength
may be useful to reject candidate coherent theories for which the description
is less than maximal. Other aspects of a coherent theory discussed include
universal applicability, the relation to the anthropic principle, and possible
uniqueness. It is suggested that the basic properties of the physical and
mathematical universes are entwined with and emerge with a coherent theory.
Support for this includes the indirect reality status of properties of very
small or very large far away systems compared to moderate sized nearby systems.
Discussion of the necessary physical nature of language includes physical
models of language and a proof that the meaning content of expressions of any
axiomatizable theory seems to be independent of the algorithmic complexity of
the theory. G\""{o}del maps seem to be less useful for a coherent theory than
for purely mathematical theories because all symbols and words of any language
musthave representations as states of physical systems already in the domain of
a coherent theory.

development of new quantum algorithms. The strategy chosen is to begin by
focusing on the class of abelian quantum hidden subgroup algorithms, i.e., the
class of abelian algorithms of the Shor/Simon genre. Our strategy is to make
this class of algorithms as mathematically transparent as possible. By the
phrase ""mathematically transparent"" we mean to expose, to bring to the surface,
and to make explicit the concealed mathematical structures that are inherently
and fundamentally a part of such algorithms. In so doing, we create symbolic
abelian quantum hidden subgroup algorithms that are analogous to the those
symbolic algorithms found within such software packages as Axiom, Cayley,
Maple, Mathematica, and Magma.
  As a spin-off of this effort, we create three different generalizations of
Shor's quantum factoring algorithm to free abelian groups of finite rank. We
refer to these algorithms as wandering (or vintage Z_Q) Shor algorithms. They
are essentially quantum algorithms on free abelian groups A of finite rank n
which, with each iteration, first select a random cyclic direct summand Z of
the group A and then apply one iteration of the standard Shor algorithm to
produce a random character of the ""approximating"" finite group A=Z_Q, called
the group probe. These characters are then in turn used to find either the
order P of a maximal cyclic subgroup Z_P of the hidden quotient group H_phi, or
the entire hidden quotient group H_phi. An integral part of these wandering
quantum algorithms is the selection of a very special random transversal, which
we refer to as a Shor transversal. The algorithmic time complexity of the first
of these wandering Shor algorithms is found to be O(n^2(lgQ)^3(lglgQ)^(n+1)).
