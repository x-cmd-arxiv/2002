fields coupled to a dissipative matter fluid cooperate to produce power--law
inflation. The scalar fields are driven by an exponential potential and the
bulk dissipative pressure coefficient is linear in the expansion rate. We find
that the entropy of the fluid attains its asymptotic value in a characteristic
time proportional to the square of the number of fields. This scenario remains
nearly isothermal along the inflationary stage. The perturbations in energy
density and entropy are studied in the long--wavelength regime and seen to grow
roughly as the square of the scale factor. They are shown to be compatible with
COBE measurements of the fluctuations in temperature of the CMB.

low-order CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line emitting galaxies for optimal
centimeter(cm)-wave surveys using future radio telescopes, such as the Square

these results to surveys that can be done with the next-generation mm-wave
telescope, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). Operating at 22 GHz the
SKA will be competitive with the ALMA in terms of the detection rate of lines
from high-z galaxies, and will be potentially superior by an order of magnitude
if extended to 43 GHz. Perhaps more importantly, cm-wave telescopes are
sensitive to lower excitation gas in higher redshift galaxies, and so provide a
complementary view of conditions in high redshift galaxies to mm-wave surveys.
We have also included in our models emission from HCN. The number of HCN(1-0)
detections will be about 5% of the CO detections in the (CO-optimized) 22 GHz

the SiO emission is restricted to two major features. The first feature,
referred to as the SiO supershell, is an open shell of 150 pc diameter, located
120 pc west from the galaxy center.
  The SiO supershell represents the inner front of a molecular shell expanding
at 40 km/s, produced by mass ejection around a supercluster of young stars
containing supernova remnant SNR 41.95+57.5. The second feature is a vertical
filament, referred to as the SiO chimney, emanating from the disk at 200 pc

Their magnitude distribution supports a smooth transition between the faint

too bright and too large to be accounted for by globular clusters. For the only

small-scale structure of space-time of Sorkin et al. is briefly reviewed and
expanded. The algebraic model suggested, called quantum causal set, is
physically interpreted as a locally finite, causal and quantal version of the
kinematical structure of general relativity: the 4-dimensional Lorentzian
space-time manifold and its continuous local orthochronous Lorentz symmetries.
We discuss various possible dynamical scenarios for quantum causal sets mainly
by using sheaf-theoretic ideas, and we entertain the possibility of
constructing an inherently finite and genuinely smooth space-time background
free quantum theory of gravity. At the end, based on the quantum causal set
paradigm, we anticipate and roughly sketch out a potential future development
of a noncommutative topology, sheaf and topos theory suitable for quantum
space-time structure and its dynamics.

degenerate entries. It dominates over the whole neutrino mass matrix. In such a

unbounded Hamiltonian system with a generalization. We show that a well-known
quantized complex energy eigenvalues which is related to decay widths can be
given with this approach.
