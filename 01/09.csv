that the density and velocity dispersion profiles of dark-matter haloes display
well-definite universal forms whose origin remains unknown. In the present
paper, we calculate the internal structure of haloes expected to arise in any
such cosmologies by simply taking into account that halo growth proceeds
through an alternate sequence of discrete major mergers and long periods of
gentle accretion. Major mergers cause the violent relaxation of the system
subject to the boundary conditions imposed by accreting layers beginning to
fall in at that moment. Accretion makes the system develop inside-out from the
previous seed according to the spherical infall model. The predicted structure
is in very good agreement with the results of numerical simulations,
particularly for moderate and low mass haloes. We find strong indications that
the slight departure observed in more massive systems is not due to a poorer
theoretical prediction, but to the more marked effects of the limited
resolution used in the simulations on the empirical profiles. This may have
important consequences on the reported universality of halo structure.

the radial direction escapes to infinity at a different angle $\psi>\alpha$.
This bending of light is caused by a strong gravitational field. We show that,
in a Schwarzschild metric, the effect is described by
$1-\cos\alpha=(1-\cos\psi)(1-r_g/R)$ where $R/r_g$ is the emission radius in
Schwarzschild units. The formula is approximate and it applies at $R\geq 2r_g$
only, however at these radii it has amazing accuracy, fully sufficient in many
applications. As one application we develop a new formulation for the light
bending effects in pulsars. It reveals the simple character of these effects
and gives their quantitative description with practically no losses of accuracy
(for the typical radius of a neutron star $R=3r_g$ the error is 1%). The
visible fraction of a star surface is shown to be $S_v/4\pi
R^2=[2(1-r_g/R)]^{-1}$ which is 3/4 for $R=3r_g$. The instantaneous flux of a
pulsar comes from one or two antipodal polar caps that rotate in the visible
zone. The pulse produced by one blackbody cap is found to be sinusoidal (light
bending impacts the pulse amplitude but not its shape). When both caps are
visible, the pulse shows a plateau: the variable parts of the antipodal
emissions precisely cancel each other. The pulsed fraction of blackbody
emission with antipodal symmetry has an upper limit
$A_{max}=(R-2r_g)/(R+2r_g)$. Pulsars with $A>A_{max}$ must be asymmetric.

probe important issues in galaxy formation. We use semi-analytic models (SAMs)
of galaxy formation, based on the flat LCDM hierarchical structure formation
scenario with $\Omega_m=0.3$ and Hubble parameter $h=0.65$, to obtain
predictions of the EBL from 0.1 to 1000$\mu$m. SAMs incorporate simplified
physical treatments of the key processes of galaxy formation - including
gravitational collapse and merging of dark matter halos, gas cooling and
dissipation, star formation, supernova feedback and metal production -- and
have been shown to reproduce key observations at low and high redshift. We
investigate the consequences of variations in input assumptions such as the
stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the efficiency of converting cold gas
into stars. We also discuss recent attempts to determine the emitted spectrum
of high energy gamma rays from blazars such as Mrk 501 from the observed X-rays
using the synchrotron self-Compton model, and note that our favorite SAM EBL
plus the observed spectrum of Mrk 501 do not imply unphysical upturns in the
high energy emitted spectrum - thus undermining recent claims of a crisis with
drastic possible consequences such as breaking of Lorentz invariance. We
conclude that observational studies of the absorption of $\gamma$-rays will
help to determine the EBL, and also help to explain its origin by constraining
some of the most uncertain features of galaxy formation theory, including the
IMF, the history of star formation, and the reprocessing of light by dust.

fundamentally different from the known r-modes: their frequencies are functions

seconds to minutes. Due to low time resolution of former observations this
might have been overlooked -- leading to the conclusion that LP790-29 has a
rotational period of over 100 years. The optical spectrum exhibits one
prominent absorption feature with minima at about 4500, 4950, and 5350 A, which
are most likely C2 Swan-bands shifted by about 180 A in a magnetic field
between 50MG and 200MG. At the position of the absorption structures the degree
of circular polarization varies between -1% and +1%, whereas it amounts to +8
to +10% in the blue and red continuum. With this very high degree of
polarization lp790-29 is very well suited to a search for short time
variations, since a variation of several percent in the polarization can be
expected for a magnetic field oblique to the rotational axis. From our analysis
we conclude that variations on time scales from 50 to 2500 seconds must have
amplitudes <0.7% in the continuum and <2% in the strongest absorption feature

case of solar metallicity when a mixing length value $\alpha$=1.6 is assumed
($\Delta V$ is the magnitude difference between the top of the blue HB and the
fainter magnitude reached by the red HB). Uncertainties in the luminosity of
the red HB due to uncertainty in the mixing length value are discussed. We
finally discuss the much larger tilt observed in the clusters NGC 6441 and NGC
6388, reporting additional evidence against suggested non-canonical
evolutionary scenarios. Numerical experiments show that differential reddening
could produce such sloped HBs. Further, HST-PC imaging of NGC 6441 gives clear
indications about the occurrence of differential reddening across the cluster.
However, the same imaging shows that the observed slope of the red HB {\em is

halo bias on small scales. The model can be readily applied to interpreting the
clustering properties and velocity dispersion of different populations of
galaxies once a cluster-weighted bias (or equivalently an halo occupation
number model) is specified for the galaxies. Some non-trivial bias features
observed from redshift surveys of optical galaxies and of IRAS galaxies

grains provide an identification for the missing source of opacity in the
near-infrared. Using the derived dust composition, we have calculated spectra

comparison with other evolved stars. The L-[12 micron] colours of these models

distributed dynamos are compared, with the latter including the influence of
meridional flow. The overshoot layer dynamo reproduces the solar cycle periods
and the butterfly diagram only if alpha=0 in the convection zone (CZ). The
distributed dynamo including meridional flows shows the observed butterfly
diagram even with a positive dynamo-alpha in CZ. The nonlinear feedback of
strong magnetic fields on differential rotation leads to grand minima in the
cyclic activity similar to those observed. Our 2D model contains the large- and
small-scale feedback of magnetic fields on diff. rotation and induction in a
mean-field formulation (Lambda-, alpha-quenching). Grand minima may also occur
if a dynamo occasionally falls below its critical eigenvalue. We never found
any indication that such an on-off dynamo collapses by this effect after being
excited. The full quenching of turbulence by strong magnetic fields as reduced
induction (alpha) and reduced turbulent diffusivity (eta_T) is studied in 1D.
We find a stronger dependence of cycle period on dynamo number compared with a
pure alpha-quenching model giving a very weak cycle period dependence. Also the
temporal fluctuations of alpha and eta_T from a random-vortex simulation were
applied to a dynamo. Then the low `quality' of the solar cycle can be explained
with a small number of giant cells as dynamo-active turbulence. The transition
from almost regular magnetic oscillations (many vortices) to a more or less

nucleation. Heterogeneous nucleation near a wetting transition, of a
crystalline phase is studied. The wetting transition occurs at or near a
vapour-liquid transition which occurs in a metastable fluid. The fluid is
metastable with respect to crystallisation, and it is the crystallisation of
this fluid phase that we are interested in. At a wetting transition a thick
layer of a liquid phase forms at a surface in contact with the vapour phase.
The crystalline nucleus is then immersed in this liquid layer, which reduces
the free energy barrier to nucleation and so dramatically increases the
nucleation rate. The variation in the rate of heterogeneous nucleation close to
wetting transitions is calculated for systems in which the longest-range forces
are dispersion forces.

Moreover, in one of these Griffiths phases, the system has very different low

from each other by a sharply defined crossover line; on one side of this
crossover line, the system `looks' like a S=1 chain at low energies, while on

performed constructively by the method of {\it dynamical triangulations}. One
can define a {\it proper-time} propagator. This propagator can be used to
calculate generalized Hartle-Hawking amplitudes and it can be used to
understand the the fractal structure of {\it quantum geometry}. In higher
dimensions the philosophy of defining the quantum theory, starting from a sum
over Euclidean geometries, regularized by a reparametrization invariant cut off
which is taken to zero, seems not to lead to an interesting continuum theory.
The reason for this is the dominance of singular Euclidean geometries.
Lorentzian geometries with a global causal structure are less singular. Using
the framework of dynamical triangulations it is possible to give a constructive
definition of the sum over such geometries, In two dimensions the theory can be
solved analytically. It differs from two-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity,
and the relation between the two theories can be understood. In three
dimensions the theory avoids the pathologies of three-dimensional Euclidean
quantum gravity. General properties of the four-dimensional discretized theory
have been established, but a detailed study of the continuum limit in the
spirit of the renormalization group and {\it asymptotic safety} is till
awaiting.

equilibrated quark flavours, once fixed in the primordial state, remain
constant throughout the hadronization process. This would enable the knowledge

  The first problem discussed is a notion of ``bosonized electrons

Chern-Simons gauge invariance. Therefore, their condensate is merely of
mathematical concept and the true physical state realized is a liquid-like one
made of degeneration of anyons. Based on this recognition, I argue about a
mechanism of the degeneration that results from the genuine CS gauge field
theory. It is noted that the Ginzburg-Landau effective theory is not necessary.

spacetime of a point source generating a magnetic field in three dimensional
Einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant. The static
(non-rotating) magnetic solution was found by Clement, by Hirschmann and Welch
and by Cataldo and Salgado. This paper is an extension of their work in order
to include (i) angular momentum, (ii) the definition of conserved quantities
(this is possible since spacetime is asymptotically anti-de Sitter), (iii)
upper bounds for the conserved quantities themselves, and (iv) a new
interpretation for the magnetic field source. We show that both the static and
rotating magnetic solutions have negative mass and that there is an upper bound
for the intensity of the magnetic field source and for the value of the angular
momentum. The magnetic field source can be interpreted not as a vortex but as
being composed by a system of two symmetric and superposed electric charges,
one of the electric charges is at rest and the other is spinning. The rotating
magnetic solution reduces to the rotating uncharged BTZ solution when the
magnetic field source vanishes.

Here we investigate the analogous question for rational functions, also we
allow the base field to be any number field. As a result, there are many more
rational functions for which the analogous property holds. Some infinite series
come from rational isogenies of elliptic curves and deformations. There are
several sporadic examples which do not fit in any of the series we obtain.
First we translate the arithmetic property to a question about finite
permutation groups, and classify those groups which fulfill the necessary
conditions. The proofs depend on the classification of the finite simple
groups. Then we use arithmetic arguments to either rule out many cases, or to
prove that the remaining cases indeed give rise to examples. This part is based
on Mazur's classical results about rational points on the modular curves X_0(p)

ability for nuclear waste incineration has led to a revival of interest in
nuclear cross sections of many nuclides over a large energy range.
Discrepancies observed between nuclear data bases require new measurements in
several cases. A complete measurement of such cross sections including
resonance resolution consists of an extensive beam time experiment associated
to a long process of analysis ans validation. With a slowing down spectrometer
associated to a pulsed neutron source, it is possible to determine good cross
section profile in an energy range from 0.1 eV to 40 keV. These measurements
performed at ISN (Grenoble) with neutron source GENEPI requires only small
quantities of matter (as small as 0.1 g) and about one day of beam per target.

periodic fiber Bragg gratings is experimentally investigated. Tunneling time
measurements as a function of barrier distance show that, far from the
resonances of the structure, the transit time is paradoxically short, implying
Superluminal propagation, and almost independent of the distance between the
barriers. These results are in agreement with theoretical predictions based on
phase time analysis and also provide an experimental evidence, in the optical
context, of the analogous phenomenon expected in Quantum Mechanics for
non-resonant superluminal tunneling of particles across two successive
potential barriers. [Attention is called, in particular, to our last Figure].

phase space by their Weyl symbols. Their semiclassical approximations are
constructed in the short and long time regimes. For both evolution problems,
the WKB representation is purely geometrical: the amplitudes are functions of a
Poisson bracket and the phase is the symplectic area of a region in phase space
bounded by trajectories and chords. A unified approach to the Schrodinger and
Heisenberg semiclassical evolutions is developed by introducing an extended
phase space. In this setting Maslov's pseudodifferential operator version of
WKB analysis applies and represents these two problems via a common higher
dimensional Schrodinger evolution, but with different extended Hamiltonians.
The evolution of a Lagrangian manifold in the extended phase space, defined by
initial data, controls the phase, amplitude and caustic behavior. The
symplectic area phases arise as a solution of a boundary condition problem.
Various applications and examples are considered.

security of quantum key distribution schemes. Nonetheless, up till now, a local
commutability constraint in the CSS code construction means that the error
correction and privacy amplification procedures of BB84 are not fully
decoupled. Here, I provide a method to decouple the two processes completely.
The method requires Alice and Bob to share some initial secret string and use
it to encrypt the bit-flip error syndrome using one-time-pad encryption. As an
application, I prove the unconditional security of the interactive Cascade
protocol, proposed by Brassard and Salvail for error correction, modified by
one-time-pad encryption of the error syndrome, and followed by the random
matrix protocol for privacy amplification. This is an efficient protocol in
terms of both computational power and key generation rate.

similarly in certain examples of searching for the minimum of a cost function

function depends only on the Hamming weight of the n bits. We also give two
examples, closely related to these, where the similarity breaks down in that
the quantum adiabatic algorithm succeeds in polynomial time whereas simulated
annealing requires exponential time.
